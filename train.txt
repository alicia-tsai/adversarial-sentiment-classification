pos	For those of you who are not aware with the theme that Kusturica continues to explore intermittently in his films -- the Western assault on traditional Serbian values -- it will be impossible for you to understand his narratives . This continuous theme , expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle , is one that Kusturica has elected to mandate . Since his fantastic work and Magnum Opus ' Underground ' , Kusturica 's films ' ' Black Cat White Cat ' , ' Life is a Miracle ' , and recently with ' Promise Me This ' , his slapstick , carnivalistic style underscores the ' westernization ' of Balkan culture , its ambivalent arrival and assault on the traditional idiom . In the case of ' Promise Me This ' , the paradoxical world of city ( urban space ) and village ( traditional idiom ) space are contrasted . The world of the city reflects western attributes that have ensconced the spatial and temporal setting ; organized crime , sexual exploitation , a ruptured sense of identity and vehement disregard for traditional values -- as expressed toward the young kid -- villager . The end of the film further exemplifies this notion as we observe a funeral mass and wedding on a one - way dirt road . They are on a collision coarse ; appropriately , the wedding , which represents the lifeline and pulse of the village , i.e. traditional values , are about to collide with the funeral mourners , exemplifying the death of tradition within this context . Yet Kusturica brilliantly examines this theme through his own unique , stylistic singularity . With his outrageous and flamboyant style serving as a vehicle in its portrayal .
neg	I was duped into seeing this movie after reading a positive review from another website and man was I p.o'd ! ! ! it took me at least 15 minutes to pick it up off the shelf b / c I did n't want anyone to see me . then another 10 minutes to build the courage to take it to the counter and actually use real money to rent it . I thought that all my stress would pay off by the time I got home to and watching the movie b / c the review I read said the movie was a pleasant surprise ; what a joke ! if you can make it through the first hour of the movie then your in luck ! b / c it 's not until then the movie turn 's into a horror . do n't bother with this one folks , your better off watching " dankness falls "
pos	All I can say about the Necromaniac / Schizophreniac 2 series is ... if you are even remotely " PC " or do n't have a seriously messed up sense of humor , then you probably wo nt get it . As sick and disgusting as this movie is , it really is a comedy and not a " horror " movie at all . If you can appreciate somebody who pushes the bounds of good taste and political correctness to the most extreme limits imaginable , to the point where is becomes so out of hand that it 's comical , then you must see this to believe it . This movie is so out of control that a major film studio could n't touch this with a 10 foot pole ( with a condom on the end ) . In my opinion though , the best , most extreme pieces of art come from way underground . If you do n't stick to the same old formula that people are used to seeing , then they reject it . I have seen stacks of terrible , boring , z - grade , Indy movies that were just a waste of a perfectly good VHS tape or DVD - R. I have also seen stacks of stink bombs coming from the big named studios that were a complete waste of millions of dollars . When a NO BUDGET film like these two from Ron Atkins / John Giancaspro come out and blow all of the other " shock " films completely out of the water , you really have to take a second look at the whole Indy movie scene . After seeing this , you can really see how much freedom an Indy film maker can have when they work on their own . The funny thing is , even the other people who saw this movie and " hated it " admit to the fact that they laughed all the way through it . I do n't think that is is possible for anybody to get bored watching either of these two . So if do n't take everything that you seen in the mainstream media too seriously , and are able to laugh at a misanthropic , puppet wielding psychopath who has finally snapped , YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS . You may just be able to see it for the stand alone , cult classic that it is . Both Schizophreniac / Schizophreniac 2 are among the favorites in my collection of well over 1000 dvds .
neg	This is the kind of movie which shows the paucity of French cinema when it comes to making thrillers . The director 's desire to " sound American " is so glaring that you will not be fooled a minute , unless you have not seen a serial killer movie since " Peeping Tom " . Two male cops ( or one and a half , more like , as you will see),horrible murders , a plot more complicated than complex . Charles Berling is not lucky with the genre(see the astoundlingly dumb " l'inconnu de Strasbourg " a couple of years ago).The scenes with his pregnant wife -which are supposed to be a counterpart for the otherwise noir atmosphere of the rest of the plot - are among the worst ever filmed . Add a steamy love scene between them and a gory autopsy to get a PG 12 and thus to attract the huge adolescent audience . A violent and absurd conclusion , followed by a silent epilogue who could make a nice commercial for the côte d'azur , it 's really the silence of the lame .
pos	This movie documents the Harlem ball circuit of the mid eighties . Much more fun than than Palazzo Volpi , though just as diseased , this movie is a true gem of squalor . One can not help but sympathize with the characters because of their freakness . The sole purpose of middle class intellectuals is to document the phenomenons of the trash and the glitz . Here the most genius of trash is extremely well documented and duly glamorized . The characters ' penchant for idolatry of all that is glamorous inspires even more adoration of the characters themselves on part of the viewer , creating a " phenomenon of a phenomenon " effect which makes this movie a piece of art .
neg	Amen to Magsel . There was a lot of confusion going on . First off , how do you know which movie you are purchasing ? Henry Cele stars in every one of them . I bought this movie thinking it was the miniseries ... WHAT A LETDOWN ! ! It would have been a comedy but for the young girl being raped . David Hasselhoff ( spelling ? ) is OK for popcorn TV but he was not believable in this film ( where was his English accent ? ) AND WHAT 'S WITH THE LOVE STORY ? ? ? The movie was supposed to be about a young man 's rise to military power - not the slave ship captain getting jiggly with the English maiden looking for her daddy ... If I had paid more than $ 7 for this movie , I would have to call the police - because that would be a crime !
pos	Recap : The morning after his bachelor party Paul is woken by his mother - in - law - to - be and discovers that there is a woman sleeping beside him . Unfortunately its a waitress from the bar , and not his fiancée . And suddenly she turns up everywhere ... the toll booth at the freeway and at his parent - in - laws dinner . And it is hard to keep a secret when her jealous ex - boyfriend had him followed and photographed . It is not only about saving his wedding ... it is about survival . Comments : Actually much better than expected . Not the sweet romantic comedy I expected , but something much funnier , something with a little edge . This movie was n't afraid to take the jokes a little further . And Jason Lee does now how to deliver comedy , especially when his character is half - panicked and deep in trouble , as he is here . And he got nice support from beautiful ladies Julia Stiles and Selma Blair . And actually I thought Lochlyn Munro did a nice part as the ex . So , more emphasis on comedy than romance , and the end result was good . I enjoyed it very much . 7/10
neg	What an empty and lack lustre rendition of the classic novel . I do wish people would stop messing about with classics when they clearly have no idea of the real intention or point of the original . This version is no different . I felt that the Ralph Fiennes version is much worse though as the casting of Juliette brioche as Kathy has got to be the worst casting decision EVER ... anyway back to this version . It aims to make the story relevant to a contemporary setting and in a musical style . It succeeds in both but high art it is nit . Throwaway viewing for a rainy day maybe ... The direction was average and the editing abysmal . Worse than the old Quincy . Deepak Verma does a great turn as Hindley and is in fact one of Britains wasted talents . The part of Heath was played with great charm and belief and I think that the casting is the strongest point of this project . Although a more talented director would have made better use of the facilities he had . Its clear that he was a director for hire and did n't instill the project with the passion that it deserved .
pos	I saw this film back at the 2005 Palm Springs International Festival and of the 14 films I saw there I would rank this # 4 . The 900 + theater was full and at the end it received a standing ovation . This was classic Peter Falk if you are a Falk fan and displayed a lot of chemistry between the Peter Falk and Paul Reiser characters . The film 's title seemed to long and too odd sounding to me . I am surprised this did n't make it into general release . This was far better than the majority of junk that the major studios throw at you . Maybe too adult in that it was geared to the baby boomer and senior audience . A lot of people could relate to situations in this movie . This will probably enjoy a revival of sorts years from now when people look back at this film and consider it a kind of a gem . I would rate this 8.0 to 8.5 on a scale of 10 and definitely recommend it .
neg	Here goes the perfect example of what not to do when you have a great idea . That is the problem is n't ? The concept is fresh and full of potential , but the script and the execution of it lacks any real substance . It should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions , get you interested and invested in the characters . This movie does n't have what it takes to take off and sustain flight , and here is why . First you do n't really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to , I mean this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here , it 's suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation . They are not believable in the way they act and interact . Example : Jeffrey Combs as a cop over chewing is gum , frowning and looking intense all the time is n't the way to go here . I mean what is that ? , he looks like he 's on the toilet or something . I loved him in re - animator and the way he was playing the intense / neurotic , unappreciated medical genius was right on the money . But not for this , he tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner , it 's not natural , I 'm surprised he did n't dislocate his jaw during filming . The movie is basically on life support , it barely has a pulse and it kept me waiting for something that would never come .
pos	I probably saw this movie first in about 1995 . Since then I 've returned to it many times . It 's great ! I especially like the first and second clips , " Creation " and " Civilization Rising . " Wow ! This was so cool back in the glory days of CG animation . CG is way older than I am , as I know the film " Tron " was made 7 years before my time . But this film was a landmark in the early ' 90s . It was probably the first collaboration of different CG experiments set to music . I like it so much , I think I 'll go watch it now . Bye
neg	Come on ! Get over with the Pakistan bashing guys . Bollywood can not only make brilliant movies- but can seriously affect a generation of viewers . I am a HUGE Bollywood fan- but anti - Pakistan movies just make me wince too much to enjoy screenplay , cinematography , action sequences- everything . I 'm really happy to see that viewers on both sides of the border are rejecting propaganda , and there are movies like Main Hoon Na out there that have done brilliantly not only because they deserved to because of the quality of its Bollywood masala- but also because it tries to say : give peace a chance and shows that there are crazies out there on both sides who do not represent the masses .
pos	An excellent movie and great example of how scary a movie can be without really showing the viewer anything . It 's a set of four stories all revolving around the tenants of a charmingly old - fashioned house and their various gruesome and horrific fates , all tied together by a wrap - around story about a Scotland Yard inspector searching for a missing horror film star . It starts out with a story about a mystery writer whose main character becomes a little too realistic , followed by a story about two old romantic rivals who become obsessed over a wax figure in a museum , then a story about a sweetly angelic little child who is anything but , and closing with the story of what happened to the missing film star  and what he does to the inspector . It 's a gorgeous print that lets you really appreciate the work of director Duffell and what he was able to accomplish with a very small budget . Add to that the acting talents of Peter Cushing , Christopher Lee , Denholm Elliott , Joss Ackland , Ingrid Pitt and Jon Pertwee and you 've got a movie that can be enjoyed again and again . Just do n't answer the phone if anyone from Stoker Real Estate calls to offer you a bargain on a beautiful house in the English countryside
neg	badly directed garbage . a mediocre nihilist sadistic gorefest ... if you are the sort of person who likes that ... see a shrink . even if you are that person it does n't make this a good film , the acting is really poor , the story full of plot holes , the director really should just give up and find a real job as he has no talent for this one . I can see why people dislike uwe boll .. we have had a few of his films on lately and this is the best of them , which is really sad ! A complete absence of any sort of humanity seems to suit some people but here it just grates . Horror films can be full of desolation , they can be miniature works of art , they can be just good viewing when there is nothing else on ... SEED is just really really poor .
pos	Omigosh , this is seriously the scariest movie i have ever , ever seen . To say that i love horror movies would be an understatement , and i have seen heaps ( considering the limited availability in New Zealand , that 's quite a lot ) , but never before have i had to sleep with the light on ... until i saw The Grudge . Some may say that it is a rip off of The Ring ( both based on Japanese horror movies ) , both similar ( yet different ) story lines , but the Grudge holds its own as a terrifying movie - seeing at at the cinema , i even screamed at a certain point in the movie . The acting is great , particularly from the supporting characters - KaDee Strickland is fantastic and steals the show , she is such an enthusiastic person . Jason Behr is a real hottie , and William Mapother looks like he is having fun . However , while i am normally a fan of Clea DuVall 's , she does n't really seem into this movie . Of the supporting characters , hers probably got the most depth and back story , but she does n't seem like she is all there . As for Sarah Michelle Gellar , well , she stays about the same through all her films and roles does n't she ? The ghosts were genuinely scary , the music and sound effects were chilling ( particularly the noise being made when KaDee Strickland 's character answered the phone in her apartment ) , the ending was cool too . Super highly recommended . 9/10
neg	Too Much of Something Borrowed Grade B- Super Bowl Sunday is one of the slowest days at movie theaters every year . Because of this , movie studios tend to avoid releasing bigger budgeted films that weekend . Every few years a studio releases a counter - programming female skewing movie ( 2001 's " The Wedding Planner " ) to compete with the big game . This Super Bowl weekend similarly titled " The Wedding Date " will try to find success and attract viewers not watching the game .   Sick of people feeling sorry for her , single - woman , Kat Ellis ( Debra Messing , TV 's " Will and Grace " ) hires male escort Nick ( Dermot Mulrony , " About Schmidt " ) to pose as her boyfriend for her sister 's wedding in London . Her family has been giving her a hard time about her not being married , and her ex- fiancé of seven years , who dumped her without a reason , is the best man . To make him jealous Kat parades Nick around her ex to make him see what he is missing . But ultimately Nick helps Kat realize that she can open up , and let someone love her . The film borrows too much from similar wedding movies . It is almost a carbon copy of 1999 's " Picture Perfect " and mixes in scenes similar to " The Wedding Planner " and " My Best Friends Wedding " . The movie also has a reverse " Pretty Women " theme going for it , and knowing her audience , the director makes clever references to that and other films . " The Wedding Date " has all the clichéd elements of a typical wedding movie , there is the stereotypical overbearing mother ( Holland Taylor , " Legally Blonde " ) , and practically plagiarized wedding speeches by the family and friends at the wedding and rehearsal dinner . The twist at the ending has been done before , but it was something that was n't completely expected . The real reason why Kat was dumped comes as a surprise and changes the direction of the film for the last half hour . Even though " The Wedding Date " is predictable , it is able to stand on its own . Debra Messing , in her first lead role , proves she can be charming and funny . Dermot Mulrony has great chemistry with Debra Messing , but most of his dialogue was too corny and unrealistic . He is able to make best of what he is given , and be able to salvage the character .   By the use of many clever puns ( often sexual ) , the film is actually funny . Although primarily a chick - flick the film has components everyone can enjoy . The feel good story , and humor make it the best date movie released in a long time .
pos	This movie is simply awesome . It was a very sensitive issue and movie was superb . This movie did not create any controversy in India ( as far as i know ) and its publicity was also kept low . Initially i thought that this movie would simply be a waste of time since most of the Indian directors and producers used to change the theme even though its very sensitive and adds a love story in original story and spoils the whole thing ... most of the Indian viewers would agree on this topic if they remember Ashoka , Mangal Pandey , LOC etc .. There have been so many movies in India which would have become milestone or mega hits if the love story part would not be unnecessarily added . But its treatment is pretty similar to Pinjar movie ( also a must watch ) . If it counts then i would like to thank Anil Kapoor ( producer ) and Firoz Abbas Khan ( the director ) for making such a great movie ..
neg	I love sharks . And mutants . And explosions . Theoretically , with those parameters in mind , HAMMERHEAD : Shark Frenzy should have been the best movie ever . It is not . The monster looks like a villain from Power Rangers , and has approximately the same range of rubbery movement . This might be okay if the makers were n't quite as proud of its design as they seem to be . That is to say , for a guy in a big rubber suit in an action / scifi / horror flick that could benefit from some mystery , the shark gets a lot of screen time . Granted , it is usually shaky and erratic . I guess you 're supposed to assume that it 's so scary that even the camera guy freaks out . The camera goes to a person about to get eaten , the camera goes to the shark . The camera goes back to the person about to get eaten , only now they are screaming and armless . And so on . The costuming is bad , the acting is poor , and the special effects are sub - par , but the writing is by far the worst . Things happen completely randomly so that more people can be eaten , or so something can explode . Because LET ME TELL YOU , the people who made this movie definitely went in with a more explosions = more better mindset . Characters shoot cars and there is a massive explosion . They shoot helicopters , there is a massive explosion . Barrels , rocks , trees , WHATEVER , they all explode , so much so that the freaking shark even explodes at the end . Speaking of which , I do n't care how crazy a person is , I find it hard to believe that anyone would think trying to make a giant half - person half - shark have sex with a woman in order to make freaky shark people babies is a good idea . That is , UNLESS that person is the mad scientist in this movie . The bad thing is , the movie is so random ( and at times , boring ) that even its badness is not really enough to hold a person 's prolonged interest . It might be a good one to MST3 K with your friends , but past that , if you happen to catch this bad boy on , do yourself a favor and change the channel .
pos	Sure it was well shot and made , very well shot and made ! But the story was just so weak . And the portrayal of Lincoln was even weaker . Not that Henry Fonda was n't good but the character he played was nothing but a loon . Do you mean to tell me that Lincoln was a wise cracking smart ass with no respect of the law or the court . I mean who the hell was he supposed to be ? Cousin Vinnie ? I mean come on , " I 'll just call you Jackass then " ? ? ? ? I understand that Ford was going for great funny hero guy but I did n't really like this guy at all . He cheats in sports , talks like a real sweet simpleton and does not seem to know were to sit in a courtroom . How am I supposed to take this seriously . The twist was even weaker . I mean come on ! That was just stupid . The whole story seemed like it was thought up by some 5 year old in his or her dreams . Saying that I liked it enough , it was very entertaining and made me laugh at several occasions so I ca n't say it 's a bad film . In fact I must say that I must say it 's good enough , nothing that entertains me and makes me laugh can be bad BUT this vivid and silly story was just so ridiculous that I ca n't understand how anyone could consider it great . I have no idea how historically accurate this film was but if any of it was true I would really have to shake my head .
neg	Bonjour Tristesse covers similar ground as ' The Member of the Wedding . ' to wit , a possessive daughter tries to prevent a relationship from forming between a beloved family member and an interloper . While critics love ' Member of the Wedding , ' I find Julie Harris to be a jumbo - drag and an adenoidal , scenery - chomping thespian in everything she 's been in . This portrays irritating , rich idiots as in Last Year at Marienbad , but this time it 's a travelogue . In this Preminger movie sequences develop , but characters do not . For the first 30 minutes he 's content to blur the father - daughter relationship between Seberg and Niven , making uncomfortable sexual readings possible . Once the conflict is introduced , Seberg ca n't deliver the depth the part requires . Kerr pulls rank and turns the film into ' Endless Love . ' Seberg 's vacuous narration , is like something out of Strange Interlude - it is not good . I really wish someone other than Niven was in his role . He spends so much time normalizing orthodox British behavior in all his movies , he never gets around to the character . In the most memorable sequence , an evening out dancing becomes a free - for - all in a harbor . Bertolucci steals the entire scene for his empty exercise , ' The Conformist . ' Kerr is on board to clasp her hands and portray another major pain ( as in Black Narcissus , Night of the Iguana , King and I , Heaven Knows Mr. Allyson , Tea and Sympathy , etc . etc . ) . Really , Kerr was a horrible actress . I wish every movie with her could end with a fatal car crash , or even better , start with one . People uncomfortable with ambiguity should avoid this .
pos	My name is Domino Harvery . { EDIT * dizzying * CHOP } My -- my -- my name is Domino Harvey . { CUT , CHOP } My name is Domino Harvey . { EDIT . CUT . Playback } Never have I seen a director take so much flack for his style before . By now it is evident that most people do not appreciate Tony Scott 's choppy , flashy , dizzying editing technique . If I have to choose between loving it and hating it , I 'd say I love it . It was borderline distracting at times , but the end result was pretty good and it 's nice to see a director with a creative edge to his style and some originality ( even if it borrows heavily from MTV videos ) . This stylistic edge manifests itself as Keira Knightley plays the role of cocky badass bounty hunter Domino Harvey and even her dialogue seems strangely choppy . Otherwise she plays her poorly because I pretty much hated her character and did not sympathize one bit with her , no matter how much she suffered . We follow Domino through her life as she joins up with fellow bounty hunters Mickey Rourke , Rizwan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez . The crew become tangled up in the FBI and suddenly has a reality show contract under Christopher Walken 's TV production company ( what is Christopher Walken doing in every film , by the way ? ) . I guess that is a clever film technique , because now Tony Scott is free to use as much flashy MTV / Reality Show editing footage as he likes . It becomes a pastiche of MTV culture at this point . It followes then that the story is told at an amazingly rapid - fire pace , with lots of raunchy strong language and gun violence . There are some funny jokes ; it 's all very modern and surreal at the same time . It 's a mess , but it 's a rather enjoyable mess . It is ultimately flawed in so many ways ( the actors try too hard to make their characters " cool " , for one ) but it works . I give it a weak 7/10 which may seem generous when compared to the general consensus of movie - goers who graded this film  but I feel it had some good ideas and executed them well . 7 out of 10
neg	Only the most ardent DORIS DAY fan could find this one even bearable to watch . When one thinks of the wealth of material available for a story about New York City 's most famous blackout , a film that could have dealt with numerous real - life stories of what people had to cope with , this scrapes the bottom of the barrel for lack of story - telling originality . Once again Doris is indignant because she suspects she may have been compromised on the night of the blackout when she returned to her Connecticut lodgings , took a sleeping potion and woke up in the morning with a man who had done the same , wandering into the house by mistake . Nobody is able to salvage this mess -- not Doris , not ROBERT MORSE , TERRY - THOMAS , PATRICK O'NEAL or LOLA ALBRIGHT . As directed by Hy Averback , it 's the weakest vehicle Day found herself in , committed to do the film because of her husband 's machinations and unable to get out of it . Too bad .
pos	The Straight Story is the tale of an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives across the state line . He decides to make the trip on his lawnmower as he ca n't drive and he wants to make the rip by himself . The film beautifully depicts his journey and the lives he touches along the way .   Richard Farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast , most notably Sissy Spacek in an endearing performance as his daughter , and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role . At first I felt that a story of an old geezer trip across the country side would be dull but I soon discovered that Lynch with all the insights in to the man life makes this a movie I would recommend to anyone .
neg	I knew nothing of this film before I was convinced to see it by a friend who had heard it was a " non - stop epic battle scene from beginning to end " . That could n't have been further from the truth . This was one of the most boring , poorly written , amateurishly directed , horribly acted films I 've ever had the misfortune to lay my eyes upon . I 'd rank it up there with the movie I consider to be the worst film of all time ... Battlefield Earth . There basically is no story , it 's hard to believe that the makers of this film thought that this cheesy soap opera crap would be taken seriously as actual historic fact . It also features some of the worst dialogue I 've ever heard ... like this little gem ... Guy tells girl " You smell like the moon . " . Girl replies " What does the moon smell like ? " OMG ! You have to be kidding me ! The scene where the guy was drawn and quartered got some good laughs from the audience since it looked so ridiculously cheap and the sound FX of the guy being ripped apart reminded me of someone making a fart sound with their mouth . If this is playing at a theater near you , avoid it at all costs . This movie is so bad that I actually made the decision about 45 minutes through that I needed to catch up on my sleep ... and I did . Awful .
pos	Once upon a time in a castle ...... Two little girls are playing in the garden 's castle . They are sisters . A blonde little girl ( Kitty ) and a brunette one ( Evelyn ) . Evelyn steals Kitty 's doll . Kitty pursues Evelyn . Running through long corridors , they reach the room where their grandfather , sitting on an armchair , reads the newspaper . Kitty complains about Evelyn , while Evelyn is looking interestedly at a picture hanging on the wall . Evelyn begins to say repeatedly : " I am the red lady and Kitty is the black lady " . Suddenly Evelyn grabs a dagger lying nearby and stabs Kitty 's doll and then cuts her ( the doll 's ) head . A fight ensues . And Evelyn almost uses the dagger against Kitty . The grandfather intervenes and the worst is avoided . Later on , their grandfather tells them the legend related to the picture hanging on the wall in front of them , in which a lady dressed in black is stabbing a lady dressed in red : " A long time ago , a red lady and a black lady lived in the same castle . They were sisters and hated each other . One night , for jealousy reasons , the black lady entered the red lady 's room and stabbed her seven times . One year later , the red lady left her grave . She killed six innocent people , and her seventh victim was the black lady . Once every hundred years , the events repeat themselves in this castle and a red lady kills six innocent victims before killing the black lady herself . " The grandfather ends his tale by saying that according to the legend , sixteen years from now , the red queen should come again and kill seven times . But he assures them that this is just an old legend . Sixteen years pass ..... This is the very beginning of the film . There are many twists and surprises in the film . It 's better for you to forget about logic ( if you really analyse it , the story does n't make sense ) and just follow the film with its wonderful colors , the gorgeous women , the clothes , the tasteful decor , the lighting effects and the beautiful soundtrack . Enjoy Barbara Bouchet , Sybil Danning , Marina Malfatti , Pia Giancaro , among other goddesses . There 's a nude by Sybil Danning lying on a sofa that 's something to dream about .

neg	Dull , flatly - directed " comedy " has zero laughs and wastes a great cast . Alan Alda wore too many hats on this one and it shows .

One of those scripts that , if you were a neophyte and submitted it to an agent or producer , would be ripped to shreds and rejected without discussion .
pos	The movie " Atlantis : The Lost Empire " is a shining gem in the rubble of films produced by the Disney Studios recently . Parents who have had to sit through " The Jungle Book 2 " or even a Pokemon movie will surely appreciate this one . The film is one of few to attempt at an original story ; previous feature films were merely re tellings of existing stories . Films such as " Toy Story " , " Finding Nemo " , and " Monsters Inc. " all do the same , but it must be noted that all were made by Pixar and only distributed by Disney . Recent films from the Disney Studios are mostly released direct to video , and are sequels to an existing successful film . The quality of those films is given way to the profitability . A new era started with " Atlantis " following it were " Mulan " , " Lilo & Stitch " , and most recently " Open Range " . The writers have created all original story lines instead of the fairy tales of the past . A good portion of the movie is devoted to the quest to find Atlantis , a task that has captured the imagination of many for hundreds of years . Including that of young Milo Thatch , voiced by Michael J. Fox . Milo is employed by a museum in Washington D.C .. His grandfather was a renowned archaeologist , who had devoted his life to discovering Atlantis . This was seen as a waste by his peers , and they wish Milo to not follow in his footsteps . After failing to convince the museum board of directors to sponsor his expedition , Milo comes home to find a woman in his darkened apartment . She takes him to her employer , a Mr. Whitmore . Whitmore was a close friend of Milo 's grandfather , and wishes to send Milo with a team to locate Atlantis . Mr. Whitmore is very wealth and has paid for the best of everything . The crew that is to accompany him is the same as his grandfathers . The journey is filled with many great obstacles to overcome and is great fun to watch . The viewer finds themselves caught up in if they will reach Atlantis . The plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery Atlantis , not just the discovery of people . It is enough to keep the interest of the older audience . The animators have done a wonderful job in then depth of the animation . The movie is very successful in blending traditional animation with Computer Generated Images . A feat not easily achieved , most audiences are quick to notice the difference in the two . The characters are believably human . There are some nice chase type scenes , with lots of action going on . A few lulls are filled with jokes that the children just may not get . The creativity of the writers really shines through . The culture of Atlantis is richly developed , including an entire language . The film uses references to Atlantis from historical sources , such as Plato . The disappearance of Atlantis from the world is explained . Believable , if by a younger audience , that magic really does exist . The powers of the people of Atlantis are not exactly presented as magic , but can best be described in this way . Although set in 1914 the level of technology used is unrealistic . The voyage is in a submarine very reminiscent of Captain Nemo 's nautilus , complete with sub pods that fire torpedoes . The giant diggers are driven by steam boilers so they did try for some era technology . The female characters are empowered in a way that women of the age would not have been , even holding roles in leadership . This is not a bad thing . It gives a good role model for my daughter to look to , rather than an all male cast . One reason this film is a favorite of mine over other Disney films is that there is not one single song , ever . A tradition that began with the first feature film , " Snow White " , and carried on through to " The Lion King " , almost every Disney film is full of upbeat songs . This is great and all , what would the Seven Dwarfs be without " Hi HO ! " ? After the millionth time through it 'd almost be better without , but this one spares the parent . Not once does every single person on the screen suddenly know the words to a song that no one has ever heard before and break out in song . I for one am grateful . The storyline and depth of animation is sure to keep the attention of both parent and child alike . It is a film I am willing to watch again and again with my children .
neg	The story is about the life of common people from Antwerp , living their lives . So I said it , and there is nothing more actually to tell about the story . The movie is fast , like an MTV - flick , and well photographed and we feel that the director is talented and should do more films . So let 's forget about this one and hope for the best with the next Deus - Barman picture .
pos	Until I saw this special on HBO , I had never heard of Eddie Izzard . I sure am glad that I have now ! He is one of the funniest comedians I have ever seen ! Rarely has a comedian immersed himself so completely in his craft then Eddie . I could not stop laughing for the entire show . If you like to laugh you HAVE to see this special !
neg	First off , the lead , Brad Dourif is a KOOK . If you 're trying to take this movie seriously , then , I guarantee he 's going to ruin it for you . If you do n't take him too seriously , then he 's actually kind of fun to watch . As with another reviewer , I loved the scene where Lisa ( Cynthia Bain ) and Dourif are declaring their love for each other - in between dodging the jets of flame shooting out of his arm in the car . Another great campy scene was watching John Landis as a snotty radio show producer getting toasted and flailing around the room . In fact , I found the last 15 minutes of the movie to be a non - stop laugh - riot - I 'm just not sure if Tobe Hooper meant it to be that way .
pos	I had started to lose my faith in films of recent being inundated with the typical Genre Hollywood film . Story lines fail , and camera work is merely copied from the last film of similiar taste . But , then I saw Zentropa ( Europa ) and my faith was renewed . Not only is the metaphorical storyline enthralling but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating . The narrator ( Max Von Sydow ) takes you through a spellbounding journey every step of the way and engrosses you into Europa 1945 . We have all seen death put on screen in a hundred thousand ways but the beauty of this film is how it takes you through every slow - moving moment that leads you to death . Unlike many films it does n't cut after one second of showing ( for example ) a knife but forces you to watch the devastating yet sensuous beauty of a man 's final moments . I think we can all take something different away from what this movie is trying to say but it is definitely worth taking the time to find out what it all really means . I would love to talk more in depth about the film for any one who wishes to send me an email . Enjoy it !
neg	When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as co - stars , you expect to find a well done horror movie , but this was actually quite different , representing as it did what I would describe as an early effort at science fiction . Karloff and Lugosi both play scientists ( Rukh and Benet respectively ) - competitors to an extent , until Rukh wins Benet over with a demonstration that proves his great theory . The science here was - to say the least - a bit rough around the edges ( thus science fiction , with the emphasis on the fiction ) but somehow Rukh harnesses some sort of ray from Andromeda that allows him to look at the earth " several thousand million years ago . " In that pre historic time , a huge meteorite slammed into Africa , leaving deposits of a substance the scientists call " Radium X " - which can heal and destroy . A large portion of the movie is set rather tediously in Africa , on a search for the meteorite deposits , which Rukh eventually finds and harnesses to create a great weapon , unfortunately infecting himself with some sort of disease that makes him a great weapon as well . Karloff and Lugosi were both pretty good here . Lugosi pulls off a role in which he 's the good guy pretty well , although I frankly found him a bit unconvincing - especially during the scenes set in Africa . The story also plodded along a bit , and while it held my attention it did n't captivate me . Given that this is really a sci - fi rather than a horror flick , and that sci - fi was in its very early stages , I suppose the movie needs to be cut a bit of slack . It was OK - nothing more , but also nothing less than that . 4/10
pos	I caught the last half of this movie on cable one night and was struck by just how morbid it was . Even when one of the two victims is at his most deteriorated , the camera keeps going . the lingering shots of his corpse being uncovered and his concentration - camp figure being zipped into a body bag are both moving and depressing . do n't watch this movie if your already depressed . then again do n't watch it if your feeling really good .
neg	Having the In - Laws over for the weekend ? Then this is the film to hasten their departure , failing that it will induce a catatonic state to bring a welcome relief from constant nagging . The film is supposedly set on board a luxury cruise ship , which is more superannuated car ferry ; the plot has more holes than the average colander and a cast dredged from the depths of the celebrity D list . An interesting piece of added amusement is playing " Spot the Villain " as passengers join the ship . You wo n't be wrong ! ! ! ! With a script that sinks faster than a brick , clichéd set pieces and copious amounts of raspberry jam doubling as blood this film attempts to encompass the genres of thriller , action movie and gore - fest and simultaneously fails to fulfil any of them . A must watch film , if only to laugh at how bad it is .
pos	The Lion King 1 1/2 is a very cute story to go along with The Lion King . It basically follows the original story of The Lion King but with a couple of twists . In the movie , e vents are explained by a different characters point of view . This story is still an original plot . As far as sequels go , Disney is n't all that great at making worthwhile ones . This one , being the third part to The Lion King ( Simba 's Pride is the second . ) actually has an original idea to it while still involving the fun of the first . Timon and Pumbaa travel along looking for the ideal place to live . After searching far and wide , they find the place of " Hakuna Matata " . They then meet a small lion named Simba , and go through many things that parents today go through . I think this is a very good movie , and I 'm happy to add it to my collection .
neg	This is one of the worst films ever . I like cheesy movies but this is simply awful . Where are the images in the film that are on the box ? I think more money was spent on the DVD box illustrations than on the entire film .   Why would a company release a DVD that the cover is so misleading ? I feel like such an idiot for renting this movie based strictly on the box . As much as I explore IMDb I should have done a little research and made a list prior to visiting my local video rental store . I have no one to blame except myself . I want my money and time back .   DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE .   Even if curiosity is motivating you , stick cocktail umbrellas in your eyes instead . It will be much more enjoyable . You have been warned !
pos	This intensely involving 2007 character - driven suspense drama is like a big , juicy piece of Shakespearean - level steak from a master filmmaker who knows how to draw out uncommonly ferocious , to - the - edge performances from his actors . Consider for starters - Henry Fonda 's lone dissenting juror in " Twelve Angry Men " , Katharine Hepburn 's delusional Mary Tyrone in " Long Day 's Journey Into Night " , Rod Steiger 's conflicted concentration camp survivor in " The Pawnbroker " , William Holden 's wintry lion in " Network " , and Paul Newman 's alcoholic lawyer in " The Verdict " . The list encompasses some of the finest screen work of the past half - century , and you can safely add Philip Seymour Hoffman 's desperately controlling Andy Hanson to the ranks . At 83 , director Sidney Lumet shows no signs of octogenarian fatigue , and in fact , he revels in the melodramatic turns of first - time screenwriter Kelly Masterson 's thickly plotted script . The scale of the story is deceptively small as it focuses on the moral compromises that unravel in a family where two brothers have become desperate for immediate cash . Woody Allen followed a similar fraternal dynamic in his last film , the oddly pinched " Cassandra 's Dream " , but Lumet is neither pinched nor cautious in his fierce approach to this inescapable tale of ambiguity and deception . The plot revolves around a crime that was meant to be victimless . Embezzling funds from his real estate company 's payroll to keep his neglected wife Gina happy and to satisfy an expensive drug habit , smooth - talking Andy is about to be exposed in an IRS audit . Meanwhile , his younger brother Hank is a mass of post - divorce , codependent insecurities falling way behind in his alimony and child support payments . Andy concocts a supposedly foolproof plan to rob their parents ' suburban jewelry store while neither of them is supposed to be there . The goal was for the brothers to collect the haul , and the parents to claim the insurance . Murphy 's Law intervenes in every possible way starting with Andy pressuring Hank to do the job himself . After some brotherly cajoling , Hank agrees to it , but too scared to do it alone , he recruits a reckless , gun - toting busboy to handle the robbery . By fate , the heist occurs on the one day that Andy and Hank 's mother is opening the shop , and things quickly spiral out of control from there . Although the back - and - forth storytelling technique is not new ( for example , Alejandro González Iñárritu 's " 21 Grams " ) , Masterson 's approach works effectively in delineating certain events from multiple perspectives so that you understand how each character is led to the repercussions of the unfortunate event . The acting is pitch - perfect starting with Hoffman 's riveting performance as Andy , a Machiavellian reptile whose cool exterior and innate amorality mask layers of resentment toward his family . I thought he was great in Tamara Jenkins ' " The Savages " , but he is even better here . Lumet even draws a solid performance from the usually insufferable Ethan Hawke as Hank , imbuing him with the emasculated weakness that informs his every ill - planned move . As their embattled father , Albert Finney acts with his typical late - career bluster , but he provides the necessary foundation for the Oedipal - level complexities . Marisa Tomei is a smart choice to play Gina , as the actress economically keys in on the responsive , watchful nature of a small but pivotal role . The estimable theater veteran Rosemary Harris ( now better known as Peter Parker 's aunt in the " Spider - Man " trilogy ) has precious little time as the mother , as does Amy Ryan as Hank 's bitter ex - wife . There are scenes that border on excessive , especially as the situation becomes increasingly desperate for the brothers , but the principals inject such energetic brio to them that the flourishes become forgivable . After the disappointment of the cartoonish " Find Me Guilty " , it is refreshing to see Lumet in peak form here . The 2008 DVD offers terrifically informative commentary from Lumet , Hoffman and Hawke , all of whom converse with ease and insight throughout . Along with the original theatrical trailer , there is also a better - than - average 24-minute featurette , " Directed by Sidney Lumet : How the Devil Was Made " , which features on - set footage and snippets of interviews with Lumet , two of the producers and the principal actors .
neg	I used to be an avid viewer until I personally spent long cold hours helping build a home for the White Family , only to be sickened to see the house a year later . All of the beautiful rock landscaping has been removed , the gorgeous rock sidewalk and front fountain have been removed , all the pine trees and pecan trees in the front have been cut down , sprinkler system has been ripped out . It now looks like a disaster area . They do n't even live there any more ... they live " in town " and come out only for the weekend . It sickens me to think of all the hours that the great people of Oklahoma donated to these people and to see the result . The story that we all saw on TV was n't completely the truth ... do n't believe every thing you see and hear .
pos	I saw this on TV so long ago that I ca n't remember when it was , but it still stands out as one of the scariest , most unnerving films I 've ever seen . There is a simultaneously subtle but intense dread induced by the woman in black lurking at the edge of the frame , not quite clearly visible , so that you feel ( like the solicitor hero ) , unsure whether its just imagination or not . It is also one of the few films which has really made me fearful to keep watching . " Production values " be hanged , good films are about a director 's ability to create atmosphere using film , actors , locations / sets , music , attention to detail , and ... imagination . A real gem .
neg	I have been familiar with the fantastic book of ' Goodnight Mister Tom ' for absolutely ages and it was only recently when I got the chance to watch this adaption of it . I have heard lots of positive remarks about this , so I had high hopes . Once this film had finished , I was horrified . This film is not a good film at all . ' Goodnight Mister Tom ' was an extremely poor adaption and practically 4.5/10 of the book was missed out . Particularly , I found that a lot of the characters and some great scenes in the book were not in this . There was not much dialogue , It was rushed and far too fast - moving , but I was mostly upset by the fact that you never got to see the bonding and love between William Beech and Tom in this film which was a true let down . The casting was not all that good , either . I thought this could have been really good , but it was so different to the book ! Anextremely poor adaption , one of the worst I 've seen . This deserves a decent remake that 'd better be 1000 times better than this pile of garbage .
pos	this movie was rather awful Vipul Shah 's last movie was good this one was just bad although it 's a good story and is handled in a great way Aatish Kapadia who adapted this movie from another gujarati play " Avjo Wahala Fari Malishu " made a good but slow pianful 2 and a half hours to watch there are a lot of flaws in this movie but it 's still a entertainer songs are rather bleaked out and do n't work well but they 're still good overall not a movie you would enthusiastically watch it 's still a story to take in to account and it 's good if you 're the relationship type pretty good movie with loads of flaws and humor that 's really not needed even one bit
neg	I really hope that Concorde / New Horizons was n't trying to make a serious horror , or even action movie when they made Carnosaur 3 . The movie is flat - out silly from start to finish . Even the humor in C3 is funny because it 's bad . Definitely a high water mark in the ' So Bad it 's Good ' genre . If you enjoy the very worst of the worst , this is for you .
pos	I recorded this ages ago but only got round to watching it today . I have been ill so had run out of stuff to watch ! I am so glad I saw it , and which I could erase my memory and watch i again for the first time . This movie is so wonderful ! It reminded me very much of Fried Green Tomatoes At The Whistlestop Cafe .   The story goes back in time and at the end of the movie we see what the connections are . Some people have said this is a kids movie . I disagree - it may be made by Disney and many characters are children , but I am 23 and I LOVED it ! There were moments when my spine tingled . The story is unlike any other film these days , full of adventure . I have just ordered the book from amazon , ca n't wait !
neg	Anyone who knows me even remotely can tell you that I love bad movies almost as much as I love great ones , and I can honestly say that I have finally seen one of the all - time legendary bad movies : the almost indescribable mess that is MYRA BRECKINRIDGE . An adaptation of Gore Vidal 's best - selling book ( he later disowned this film version ) , the star - studded MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is truly a movie so bad that it remains bizarrely entertaining from beginning to end . The X - rated movie about sex change operations and Hollywood was an absolute catastrophe at the box office and was literally booed off the screen by both critics and audiences at the time of it 's release . Not surprisingly , the film went on to gain a near - legendary cult status among lovers of bad cinema , and I was actually quite excited to finally see for the first time . Director Michael Sarne ( who only had two other previous directing credits to his name at the time ) , took a lot of flack for the finished film , and , in honesty , it really does not look like he had a clue about what he was trying to achieve . The film is often incoherent , with entire sequences edited together in such a half - hazzard manner that many scenes become nearly incomprehensible . Also irritating is the gimmick of using archival footage from the Fox film vaults and splicing it into the picture at regular intervals . This means that there is archival footage of past film stars such as Judy Garland and Shirley Temple laced into newly - film scenes of often lewd sexual acts , and the process just does n't work as intended ( this also caused a minor uproar , as actors such as Temple and Loretta Young sued the studio for using their image without permission ) . Perhaps Sarne is not the only one to blame , however , as the film 's screenplay and casting will also make many viewers shake their heads in disbelief . For instance , this film will ask you to believe that the scrawny film critic Rex Reed ( in his first and last major film role ) could have a sex change operation and emerge as the gorgeous sex goddess Raquel Welch ? ! The film becomes further hard to follow when Welch as Myra attempts to take over a film school from her sleazy uncle ( played by legendary film director John Huston ) , seduce a nubile female film student ( Farrah Fawcett ) , and teach the school 's resident bad boy ( Roger Herren ) a lesson by raping him with a strap - on dildo . Did everyone follow that ?   And it gets even better ( or worse , depending upon your perspective ) ! I have yet to mention the film 's top - billed star : the legendary screen sex symbol of the nineteen - thirties , Mae West ! Ms. West was 77 year old when she appeared in this film ( she had been retired for 26 years ) , and apparently she still considered herself to be a formidable sex symbol as she plays an upscale talent agent who has hunky men ( including a young Tom Selleck ) throwing themselves at her . As if this were n't bad enough , the tone - deaf West actually performs two newly - written songs about halfway through the film , and I think that I might have endured permanent brain damage from listening to them !   Naturally , none of this even closely resembles anything that any person of reasonable taste would describe as " good , " but I would give MYRA BRECKINRIDGE a 4 out of 10 because it was always morbidly entertaining even when I had no idea what in the hell was supposed to be going on . Also , most of the cast tries really hard . Raquel , in particular , appears so hell - bent in turning her poorly - written part into something meaningful that she single - handedly succeeds in making the movie worth watching . If she had only been working with a decent screenplay and capable director then she might have finally received some respect form critics . The rest of the cast is also fine . The endearingly over - the - top John Huston ( who really should have been directing the picture ) has some funny moments , Rex Reed is n't bad for a non - actor , and Farrah Fawcett is pleasantly fresh - faced and likable . Roger Herren is also fine , but he never appeared in another movie again after this ( I guess he just could n't live down being the guy who was rapped by Raquel Welch ) . And as anyone could guess from the description above , Mae West was totally out of her mind when she agreed to do this movie - but that 's part of what makes it fun for those of us who love bad cinema .
pos	Prince stars as ' the Kid ' in this semi - autobiographical film of a talented , but narcissistic young musician who has a less then stellar home life . True the acting leaves a tad to be desired ( barring Morris Day and especially Clarence Williams who are both pitch perfect ) , but the movie is still great and among the best to come out of the 1980s . It has the best soundtrack of ANY movie of the last 50 years at least , highly quotable lines , and the dumpster scene is HILARIOUS ! ! Plus Apollonia is just simply STUNNING . On an unrelated not , when I saw Prince in concert in 2004 he blew down the stadium . He is an expert showman and it was one of the best concerts that I 've experienced .

neg	I am still trying to determine whether the previous installment was worse than this one , or vice versa . Being that it is nearly fifteen years since I saw this film , the fact that I remember so little about it does not bode well . Perhaps it is simply because I only watched it once or twice , but I doubt it . If there was anything worth remembering about this film , you can rest assured I would remember it . At the time this film was released , the franchise was still entering its dying phase , so a lot of media coverage was allotted to it . It 's never a good sign when teenie pop magazines contain explanations of the plot basics . One such article had to explain that Freddy was left too weak to infest the dreams of grown humans , so he decides to go after Alice 's unborn son . So far , so good , but this is the job of the writer or the director to explain to the audience . It should not be left to some unrelated publication . Making use of the trivia given in part three about Freddy 's conception , one could half expect scenes that would lift this joke out of the " horror for infants " category , but alas , that was not to be . It goes to show the sheer idiocy of the American ratings system that a piece of B'harni - esque garbage like this could get the same rating as a genuinely frightening piece like the original . By this time , the franchise could not attract anyone with an active career . Fortunately , or unfortunately depending on how you look at it , Lisa Wilcox was there to provide a quotient of competent acting . Or perhaps she just looks competent by comparison to the rest of the cast . Either way , given that her last role was in something called The All New Adventures of Chastity Blade , I doubt she really had anything else going for her . Even poor old Robert Englund has been in better productions than that in the past fifteen years . Given that box office returns were in a steady decline , and not just for this franchise , at the time , one would have thought that the studios would realize neutering their films does not make them more saleable . In fact , this particular film , like its immediate predecessor , was so neutered that not only did it fail to attract a new audience , both succeeded in alienating the core audience that originally supported the franchise . Despite this , part five must be given some credit for not having the bright , luminescent feeling that made part four so insulting to look at . I gave A Nightmare On Elm Street Part Five a one out of ten . By trying to appeal to everyone , or the MPAA 's idea of everyone , it succeeds in appealing to noone . Like parts two and four , one could erase it from the continuity entirely , and nobody would notice the difference .
pos	Despite excellent trailers for Vanilla Sky , I was expecting to be disappointed by the film because I 'd heard that it did not get great reviews . However , I left the cinema completely in awe of how good Vanilla Sky is . There was no bad acting at all in the whole film , every single character is believable . The romantic moments between Cruise 's character , David Aames and Cruz 's character , Sophia are tear - jerkingly realistic and intimate ( probably due to the fact that they were a soon - to - be real - life couple ) . The plot of Vanilla Sky will confuse you in the last third of the film and there 's very little chance of you guessing the ending . However , ends are tied up towards the end , leaving you with a strange mixture of feelings consisting of sadness , shock and empathy for David Aames . The film is intellectual and you have to pay attention throughout . This is n't that hard because chances are that you 'll be completely drawn in to the film and wo n't take your eyes off the screen for one second . I usually leave cinemas forgetting all about the film I just watch . But Vanilla Sky is still lingering in my mind days after watching it . I recommend it to anyone who wants a change from simple , shallow films .
neg	The movie starts out fine . Widower out with new girlfriend and the children . The movie is filled with stupid director 's choices . Like " lets separate . " " I am coming down to ....

pos	Do n't let my constructive criticism stop you from buying and watching this Romy Schneider classic . This movie was shot in a lower budget , probably against the will of Ernest Marishka , so he had to make due . For example england is portrayed as bordering on Germany . BY a will of the wisp Victoria and her mom are taking a vacation to Germany by buggy ride alone . They arrived their too quick . This probably could not be helped but the castle they rented , for the movie , was Austrian . When she 's told that she 's queen she goes to the royal room where the members of the court bow to her , where are the British citizens out side from the castle cheering for their new queen ? Why ISBN't she showing her self up to the balcony to greet her subjects ? Low budget!Where the audience back then aware of these imperfection ? I wonder how the critics felt?Durring the inn scene she meets prince Albert but ISBN't excited about it . Durring the meeting in the eating side of the inn your hear music from famous old American civil war songs like " My old Kentucky home " , and " Old black Joe " . What ? civil war songs in the 1830 's ? Is Romy Schneider being portrayed as Scarlet?Where 's Mammy ? Is Magna Shnieder playing her too ? Is Adrian Hoven Rhett or Ashley ? What was in Marishka mind?Well this add to the camp . It 's unintentionally satirizing Queen Victoria'a story . This is the only reason you should collect it or see it 03 11 09 correction Germany and england are connected
neg	Nicole Eggert was listed as the star of this , despite Micheal Dorn & Stacey Keach being much bigger stars than her . Basically this is a bit of a spin on the " Alien lands on Earth " film . Eggert plays the girl who feels sorry for an Alien being chased by the military and takes in the runaway creature in her very sexy disguise . A bit of nudity and partial nudity , a pointless sex scene all feature along the way . The film stumbles through a few obvious set - pieces and running jokes about being shown photographs . I quite liked the Star Trek jokes when Micheal Dorn had been taken over and he got a really cool death scene . It was fairly obvious that Stacey Keach was going to be taken over and the film had quite a weak ending , it would have been nice to show exactly what kind of talent the Alien passed to Eggert .
pos	Buster Keaton was finding his feature length voice in " Three Ages . " There are some fine sequences , but it does n't quite hang together . The " chariot race " in " Three Ages " is hilarious . Included are 2 shorts , one of which , " The Goat , " is excellent .
neg	This movie was absolutly awful . I ca n't think of one thing good about it . The plot holes were so huge you could drive a Hummer through them . The acting was soo stuningly bad that even Jean Claude should be ashamed , and that is saying alot ! ! ! And dialogue , What dialogue???To think that I was a fan of the first one ( I use that comment loosely , its more like a guilty pleasure , than anything else ) . This movie had Goldberg in it for crying out loud ! ! ! ! Nothing good can come of this movie . What makes this film even worse is that it is soo bad you ca n't even watch it with a bunch of friends to make fun of ! ! ! This has got to be in my top five worst movies of all time . 2/10 because it is soo hard for me to give a 1 .
pos	Street Fight is a brilliant piece of brutal satire . This is not a movie you just watch for fun . It is not a comfortable experience , although it does have some laugh - out - loud moments . This is a movie you watch when you need food for thought . To dismiss this film as simply racist is to miss the point entirely . This is not only a satire of Song of the South , it 's also a biting commentary on the prejudices that Americans still have as a society . Every ethnic group portrayed in the movie gets shown as grotesque caricatures of their stereotypes , which in turn are grotesque caricatures of real people . Through this wild exaggeration , the filmmaker shows just how absurd these tightly - held beliefs really are . If you 're the sort of person who 's willing to acknowledge the ugliness of the prevalent prejudices American culture still holds , and if you 're not afraid to look your own prejudices in the eye , this movie may be for you .
neg	- A film crew is shooting a horror movie in an old , supposedly cursed house where over the years , seven people have mysteriously died . One of the crew finds an old book of spells and it looks like it would be perfect to use in some of the ritual scenes in their movie . It is reasoned that the spells in the book are better written than the script they are using . But as the book is read , the graveyard outside suddenly comes to life . Now the cast and crew are faced with real danger . - IMDb lists a running time of 90 minutes . For the first 60 of those minutes , nothing happens . Far too much time is spent on the movie within a movie . Are we supposed to be frightened by the horror movie that they are shooting ? We already know that their movie is n't " real " . These scares just do n't work . - There are very few things to enjoy about The House of Seven Corpses . The acting is atrocious . Most of these " actors " would have trouble making a elementary school play . The score is terrible . It is very reminiscent of a 70s television series and provides no atmosphere . Speaking of atmosphere , other than a few moments at the end of the movie , there is none to speak of . Character logic is all but non - existent . Even in a movie , you expect characters to behave in a certain way . Here , I do n't think I remember one scene where a character did n't choose the most illogical avenue available to them . And finally , there 's those first 60 minutes of the movie that I 've already mentioned . Can you say BORING ?   - I have n't rated The House of Seven Corpses any lower because of instances where the movie ( probably by accident ) actually works . My two favorite are the beginning and ending . The opening title sequence presents the deaths of the seven previous owners and may be the highlight of the movie . And , the ending scenes on the massive staircase as the zombie menaces the film crew are somewhat effective ( what a ringing endorsement ) . Overall though , these moments are n't enough to make this a good movie .
pos	OK , let 's get this clear . I 'm really not into sci - fi , but for some reason I love Stargate SG-1 .   Jack O'Neil takes his team SG-1 through a Stargate . A round device that creates a wormhole . It gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds . It might sound like your usual sci - fi - series , but it 's not ! The plot is set today not in some distant millennium like many other sci - fi - series . I find that great . It gives you things , happenings and such you can relate to , and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all the gadgets . They have some of course but thanks to O'Neil who likes to keep a simple terminology , there 's not many .   The series has a nice blending of action , humor and drama . If you enjoy loads of special effects you 're not going to find it here . They do n't use many bad ones but a limited amount of well made special effects .
neg	This is to the Zatoichi movies as the " Star Trek " movies were to " Star Trek "-- except that in this case every one of the originals was more entertaining and interesting than this big , shiny re - do , and also better made , if substance is more important than surface . Had I never seen them , I would have thought this good - looking but empty ; since I had , I thought its style inappropriate and its content insufficient . The idea of reviving the character in a bigger , slicker production must have sounded good , but there was no point in it , other than the hope of making money ; it 's just a show , which mostly fails to capture the atmosphere of the character 's world and wholly fails to take the character anywhere he has n't been already ( also , the actor was n't at his best ) . I 'd been hoping to see Ichi at a late stage of life , in a story that would see him out gracefully and draw some conclusion from his experience overall ; this just rehashes bits and pieces from the other movies , seasoned with more sex and sfx violence . Not the same experience at all .
pos	Featuring a few of Hammer 's all - stars , this highly effective slice of British horror revolves around a house and the fates of it 's previous tenants , whose stories are all told to a Scotland yard detective , in search of a missing actor . Story number one , which is probably the least impressive of the four , deals with a writer and his wife who 've just moved in the house and plan to stay just for a short time so that he may write one of his horror novels . He creates a demented character named Dominic , who 's a very creepy looking strangler , and soon finds himself going mad as he starts to seeing this beastly looking man everywhere he goes . After his wife convinces him to seek psychiatric help , a sub - plot is introduced which frankly , did n't really work for me . I wo n't spoil it for you . The next story ( the best in my opinion ) stars the wonderful Peter Cushing as Philip Grayson , a man who 's moved into the home for his retirement years and soon makes his way to a nearby wax museum(that deals in the macabre ) where he 's very startled to find a wax figure that looks exactly like a woman from his past . Soon thereafter , an old friend(who also has a history with this woman ) is in town for business and drops by to see him . The two men are in for a rude awakening as they soon discover that there was more to this woman than meets the eye . Story three stars one of my very favorites ... Christopher Lee , who plays John Reid . After moving into the home with his peculiar daughter Jane , the nanny that he hires becomes awfully suspicious as to the way Reid suppresses his daughter . Well come to find out ... if she knew what Lee did , she would have certainly understood . The final story is a rather light - hearted vampire tale that stars John Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt . After buying a cloak from a mysterious merchant , actor Paul Henderson finds himself turning into the very creature that he 's portrayed several times in his career . Overall , the pacing and direction were very good , as was the most of the performances . There were nice Gothic touches here and there and an effective score to complement the ambiance . This one 's a keeper , and comes highly recommended .
neg	The most horrible retelling of a great series . It should not have been named Battlestar Galactica , because it 's only the same in name alone . Too many changes to just have changes . You have characters turned from male to female , black to asian to cylon all in a way to " attract female audiences , " when there was already strong female characters that could have just been made stronger . Gone are the egyptian feeling . Gone are the quest for earth . The lack of cylons to go to terminator rejects takes away from the film , especially when one is made a fembot . Granted the original show had a lot of cheese to it , but it had a large following . They tried to hold onto this following but give the fans nothing to work with and basically spit in their face as they make it " their own story . " Changes are good , when they make something better , not to just make them .
pos	This film plays really well with an audience . Especially once the chase begins . Plus , Trevor Howard with his sensible , smart charms and Jean Simmons with her innocent demeanor and piercing eyes are terrific together . The film starts as a psychological drama but after the murder it segues into a chase thriller as the two leads head for the border . Some may think the chase is superfluous but actually the chase is essential because it aids in clearing the mind of the Jean Simmons character by getting her out of the oppressive household , plus it helps bring out the real killer - who is suddenly put into such a position that they have to finish the job . The killer rightly believed that once the Simmons character was arrested she would be put away . And it is true that her lack of control in the household - as well as evidence pointing her way - there is no way she would have gotten out of the murder charge . The chase that ensues helps bring out the truth . This is an entertaining film . Seek it out if you can find it .
neg	There is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not related to one of the stars or a producer : actress Nichole Hiltz . She is the show in this slow moving and wildly unlikely story of revenge . Directed by Simon Gornick , the film stars Joyce Hyser as a betrayed wife who decides to seek revenge on her cheatin ' spouse . Oh , but not by conventional means . She plans a total guerrilla war and recruits bad girl Nichole Hiltz as her weapon of choice . She wants Nichole ( as Tuesday ) to get close to her ex ( the handsome but dull Stephan Jenkins , who should stick to music ) to embarrass him and ruin his life . David DeLuise is good in his few brief moments , and former " Crime Story " star Anthony Dennison is given virtually nothing to do but scowl . Hiltz on the other hand comes off at various times as sexy and playful , then evil and devious . She also handles vulnerable and " maybe a bit psychotic " well . She 's also quite hot ( though there 's no naughty bits show ) so you can understand how she might be able to get to any guy she is aimed at . But the performance is kind of wasted in this movie , which is just not edgy or interesting enough to recommend .
pos	I 've seen this movie about 6 times now . And each time I view it , I 'm more impressed by the story and the acting . Its like watching a train wreck being set in motion . Its subtle in its approach , but very effective in reaching its goal .   Spoilers- > At the center of the story is a very nice dichotomy . On the one hand we have Deputy major , Eddy Calhoun ( Cusack ) unknowingly tearing at the old boys network that forms the hart of major of New York 's Administration and on the other hand we have the mob boss Zappati who 's deliberately trying to maintain the status quo through all means necessary . This situation nicely culminates in the end when Zappati orders Alselmo to make it easy on himself by killing himself and Calhoun ordering Pappas to do the same , politically speaking . The movie also contains some really great one - liners such as ( a personal weakness of mine ) : - You do n't sum up a man 's life in one moment - The only thing new in this world is the history you do n't know All in all , a great movie that deserves a much higher rating .
neg	I had the " privilege " of attending a special screening of ' The Absence of Light ' at a horror convention in Ohio . First off , you know you 're in trouble when the director introduces a film , saying : " Now keep in mind , we did n't have much money ... " Not that no - budget films are bad , but when a filmmaker uses this as an excuse , the results are always poor . And there is no better example than this unwatchable sleep - fest .   Actually , ' Absence of Light ' marks a first in the world of underground cinema : It 's the only time I 've seen a dream - cast of talented genre vets actually bore me . Charismatic actors like David Hess , Tony Todd and Reggie Banister randomly enter and exit the movie and prove to be every bit as uninteresting as the amateurish no - names . Who are their characters ? What are they talking about ? Who cares ? It 's all so dull , you 'll cease to care about anything or anyone . After thirty minutes of this endurance test , I gave up and walked out of the theater . Not surprisingly , so did most of the cast members in attendance .   Any curious genre fans would do well to stay away from this . With a little luck , this movie wo n't ever see the " light " of day .
pos	Yes , I call this a perfect movie . Not one boring second , a fantastic cast of mostly little known actresses and actors , a great array of characters who are all well defined and who all have understandable motives I could sympathize with , perfect lighting , crisp black and white photography , a fitting soundtrack , an intelligent and harmonious set design and a story that is engaging and works . It 's one of those prime quality pictures on which all the pride of Hollywood should rest , the mark everyone should endeavor to reach . Barbara Stanwyck is simply stunning . There was nothing this actress could n't do , and she always went easy on the melodramatic side . No hysterical outbursts with this lady - I always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses like Bette Davis or Joan Crawford , and this movie confirmed my opinion . Always as tough as nails and at the same time conveying true sentiments . It is fair to add that she also got many good parts during her long career , and this one is by far the least interesting . The title fits this movie very well . It is about desires , human desires I think everyone can understand . Actually , no one seems to be scheming in this movie , all characters act on impulse , everybody wants to be happy without hurting anybody else . The sad fact that this more often than not leads to complications makes for the dramatic content into which I will not go here . I liked what this movie has to say about youth , about maturing and about the necessity to compromise . The movie I associate most with this one is Alfred Hitchcock 's Shadow of a Doubt , it creates a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricatured Small Town America . The story has a certain similarity with Fritz Lang 's considerably harsher movie Clash by Night , made one year earlier , where Stanywck stars in a similar part . I can also recommend it .
neg	Lot of silly plot holes in the film . First we see him watching his master practice kung - fu , and die in the midst of his practice . That 's fine with me . And then at the end of the film , we see him use the kung - fu that he learned just by watching his master when he was still a kid . Is that even possible ? I do n't think so . This show is purely for Jay Chou fans , and the film lacks a depth in terms of character development , cinematography styles and unfolding of plot . Anybody notice that the captain of the basket team ( forgot his name ) and the idolized player Li Xiao look so similar to each other , to the extent that you 'd think they were the one and same person ? Long hair , sunshine - boy look , tall and strong . The two of them looked like they came out from a mass production factory designed to churn out products that makes teenage girls scream wild in orgasm . Not that those two actors had anything of value to contribute to the movie as a whole for the movie industry at all . The jokes were lame and not funny at all . The scene with regards to the 4 masters of Jay Chou coming back to help him out in the basketball court , degenerated into a pointless plot when they started bashing their opponents ala Royal Rumble style . Worse of all , when the 4 masters won the fight , the crowd began cheering , and the match continued . It was truly a WTF ? moment . At the end of the show , when they win the match , all thanks to Jay Chou 's excellent kung fu skills . How he acquired those kung - fu skills is a mystery , because the show somehow shows him acquiring the skills just by observing his master . And then his long - lost father comes out of the woodwork to acknowledge Jay Chou as his long - lost son seemed just a tad too quick of the director to wrap up the film . In short , this is a Jay Chou - flick ( instead of the usual " chick flick " ) . Watch it only if Jay Chou is your fan . If you are one of those whose tastes in movies coincide greatly with those in the list of IMDb 's top 250 films of all time , then this film is not for you .
pos	Deranged and graphically gory Japanese film about little beings taking people over and turning them into necroborg - zombie like machines- which beat and hack each other apart so that the winner can eat the loser . In the middle of this a pair of lovers become infected . Technically superb horror comedy ( ? ) is only for those with strong stomachs as blood and body parts go flying . Good taste prevents me from describing what happens here , but lets just say its pretty gruesome . If you like this sort of thing with form several steps above slender content by all means see this film . Personally I 'm not normally one to enjoy films like this on anything but the how sick and twisted do they go level . Here I was intrigued enough that I can suggest it to people I know who like really gory movies .. Its also a film with enough going on in the details that I want to see it again since now that I know what was going on - as revealed in the end - I want to go back and see what it was I did n't catch on to . There is an internal logic rare in these films . 7ish out of 10 for those who like blood and severed limbs , its a zero or more precisely a run and hide alert for everyone else .
neg	This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life . The plot and message are horrible . There are too many mistakes in this movie that it 's impossible to keep up . I do n't even understand how this movie can get any nomination , let alone 2 . Here 's why : 1 ) Sam Lee portrays a angry / irrational detective which was caused by the disappointment from his dad . Pros : He 's angry alright . Cons : When it comes to the explanation scene , he can not convey the sadness / disappointment he has in his father . The crying scene was too fake and it seems like he is literally squeezing out tears from the corner of his eyes . 2 ) To connect the movie to the title , there were barking or dog wimping sounds during the fight scenes and rape scene , which is totally irrelevant and confusing to the viewer . I understand that it 's supposed to be a metaphor or what not ... but it 's just sooo dumb ! 3 ) WHY THE HECK DID THE COPS NOT SHOOT THE KILLER ? What the heck is wrong with this movie . When the killer started stabbing an officer , SHOOT him . He 's already dead ! What the heck ? There were lots of opportunity that the killer could be killed , but I do not know why he was n't ! 4 ) During the scene where the girl had her foot hurt . In the scene , it was very clear that the LEFT foot of the girls was hurt , so how the heck in the next scene that she 's lending all her weight on her left foot ? And this is the actress nominated as the best new performer ? WTF ? 5 ) The sounds in the movie are off sync . 6 ) I am guessing that this movie is trying to bring awareness of the brutality and violence among children in South East Asia , so why does the bad guy wins and then the cop was joining the fight ? 7 ) This movie is just too violent without a purpose . Cops are beating CI to a pulp and then if they cooperate , they give them marijuana and coke ? This is overall the worst movie . I truly feel that the person who wrote this movie is a sadist and sick person . I have never seen a more disgusting movie in my whole entire life . WORST MOVIE EVER !
pos	Henri Verneuil represented the commercial cinema in France from 1960 - 1980 . Always strong at the box - office , and usually telling dramatic and suspenseful tales of casino robberies , mafia score - settling and World War II battles , Verneuil could be counted on to give us two solid hours of entertainment on Saturday night . He worked with the cream of the male actors of his day : Gabin , Belmondo , Fernandel , Delon , Sharif , Anthony Quinn . I ... comme Icare is the only time he directed Yves Montand . It 's an oddly static film , taking place mainly in offices and conference rooms , containing not one chase scene and hardly any violence . Montand gives a good performance , if somewhat dry , and he is well supported by the other actors . I could n't help wondering what Costa - Gavras could have done with this story , on the basis of Z ( the Lambrakis assassination ) and L'aveu ( the torture of Artur London in Czechoslovakia by Stalinists ) .
neg	Uta Hagen 's " Respect for Acting " is the standard textbook in many college theater courses . In the book , Hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to developing a character as an actor : the Presentational approach , and the Representational approach . In the Presentational approach , the actor focuses on realizing the character as honestly as possible , by introducing emotional elements from the actor 's own life . In the Representational approach , the actor tries to present the effect of an emotion , through a high degree of control of movement and sound . The Representational approach to acting was still partially in vogue when this Hamlet was made . British theater has a long history of this style of acting , and Olivier could be said to be the ultimate king of the Representational school . Time has not been kind to this school of acting , or to this movie . Nearly every working actor today uses a Presentational approach . To the modern eye , Olivier 's highly enunciated , stylized delivery is stodgy , stiff and stilted . Instead of creating an internally conflicted Hamlet , Olivier made a declaiming , self - important bullhorn out of the melancholy Dane -- an acting style that would have carried well to the backs of the larger London theaters , but is far too starchy to carry off a modern Hamlet . And so the movie creaks along ungainfully today . Olivier 's tendency to e - nun - ci - ate makes some of Hamlet 's lines unintentionally funny : " In - stead , you must ac - quire and be - get a tem - purr - ance that may give it ... Smooth - ness ! " Instead of crying at meeting his father 's ghost ( as any proper actor could ) , bright fill lights in Olivier 's pupils give us that impression . Eileen Herlie is the only other actor of note in this Hamlet , putting in a good essay at the Queen , despite the painfully obvious age differences ( he was 41 ; she was 26 ) . The other actors in this movie have no chance to get anything else of significance done , given Olivier 's tendency to want to keep ! the camera ! on him ! at all ! times !   Sixty years later , you feel the insecurity of the Shakespearean stage actor who lacked the confidence to portray a breakable , flawed Hamlet , and instead elected to portray a sort of Elizabethan bullhorn . Final analysis : " I would have such a fellow whipped for o'er - doing Termagant ; it out - herods Herod : pray you , avoid it . "
pos	A charming little film set in the UK about the reunion of a WWII all girl ( almost ) swing band . A fine cast of oldsters bring lighthearted perspectives on life to this fun tale with an award winning performance by Dench and Laine 's always great " pipes " . Time well spent and a fun watch for all .
neg	My favorite memory of this show and the band was when I got together with a bunch of my friends which are NBB haters and had a big bonfire and we took a CD of their songs and the DVD of the movie and a bunch of pictures of the band members and threw them into the fire and danced a happy jig around the burning stuff while singing " Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead " . That was the best thing about the show and this show is stupid with a capitol God this show sucks . I hate it so much . Get rid of the crappy car . You guys really suck ! You really ruined the whole channel ! No offence or anything but you guys need to get a life , I mean , really , who makes a stupid show with a stupid lead singer that ca n't even sing ! You guys really sound horrible and need to get a life as hobos or something , except Roselina . She 's really pretty . But still , you guys reak !
pos	This is a really heart - warming family movie . It has absolutely brilliant animal training and " acting " ( if you can call it like that ) as well ( just think about the dog in " How the Grinch stole Christmas " ... it was plain bad training ) . The Paulie story is extremely well done , well reproduced and in general the characters are really elaborated too . Not more to say except that this is a GREAT MOVIE ! My ratings : story 8.5/10 , acting 7.5/10 , animals+fx 8.5/10 , cinematography 8/10 . My overall rating : 8/10 - BIG FAMILY MOVIE AND VERY WORTH WATCHING !
neg	I watched this movie purely for the setting . It was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares of . The plot was predictable , the acting was mediorcre at best , the scares were all gross - outs , not true scares . I do n't remember much of the plot , and I think that 's because there was n't much of one to remember . They did n't even use the hotel to it 's fullest potential ... The beaches are fantastic and the hotel is situated on a peninsula . At low tide , you can walk almost 1/4 mile into the bay , which is actually an eerie sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracks . The best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can fast forward through the action ( and I 'm using that term loosly)scenes and pause at the beauty of the surroundings !
pos	This was the beginning of it all ! Granted , this is not Friends at its best , but this was the show 's pilot , let 's not forget and not a bad one at that . We 're introduced to the gang and Central Perk , where our story begins . Even from this first episode we get a sign of the Ross - Rachel relationship that will come over the next ten years , when Ross says : ' I just want to be married again ' and Rachel storms in with a wedding dress on ... probably not intentional as at the time the writers were going for a Monica - Joey relationship but fits nicely now when looking back . Something else .. in this episode Rachel is introduced to Chandler as if the two have never met before but in later episodes , the so - called ' flashbacks ' this is contradicted as the two have met on three previous occasions . Nevertheless , the point is this a fine start to a great show . This episode may not be the usual Friends as we are accustomed to them , with the cast still a bit inexperienced but over the next few episodes we see why the show came to be what it was ! Keep watching , first season is a blast ! !
neg	Since I had loved the Inspector Gadget cartoon in the 80 's , I went to see this movie . I wasted my money . The plot was very thin . Also , the movie could not keep me interested for long . I was glad it was over . If you want to see Inspector Gadget , watch the cartoon instead . It was much better than the movie .
pos	A very funny east - meets - west film influenced by the closure of GM 's Flint , Michigan plant in the eighties and the rise and integration of Japanese automakers in the US . Set in western Pennsylvania , it features great performances by Michael Keaton , Gedde Watanabe , and George Wendt . Music by blues legend Stevie Ray Vaughan .
neg	I was excited to hear that someone had made a documentary on what it was like to be Puerto Rican . When I heard it was Rosie Perez , I wondered .. could she possibly know what it is really like to be Puerto Rican . As far as I knew .... she was a Nuyorican . Well anyway , I anxiously sat with my popcorn to watch . I realized 10 min into it that my initial apprehension was right . Rosie Perez has little knowledge about what it is like to be Puerto Rican . This " documentary " is more a 1st hand , very very personal account on what it is like to be a Nuyorican .. and all of what that entails . She ( like most of the Nuyoricans I know ) have a watered down , partial and sometimes twisted sense of history . ( How could they not .. they live here . ) Yes , all of them are proud . As they should be ! But a lot do n't know the ins and outs of the REAL culture , history and political background or language for the most part . It all became very very apparent with her participation in the Vieques issue . Regardless of my personal take is on this issue .. at least I know what the hell the fight is for . There is she is getting arrested for something she knew little about .. and only participated in because it was a " Puerto Rican Cause " I really do n't understand how she is not embarrassed to admit to it . For those of you that are not Puerto Rican , please view this as a partial account of a woman 's journey of self discovery and acceptance . Do not take this as gospel ... a lot of it is n't even true . Please consider the source . Rosie is an actress ; not a historian . This movie is not and should never be , for other Nuyoricans , the base for their information . Instead , just a step towards finding more info , learning and debating what the reality is . Not just the one coming from this woman 's eyes .
pos	A Murder investigation goes on back stage while The Vanities , on its opening night , plays on to an unknowing audience . Odd combination of musical and murder mystery is worth a look for its cast , its production numbers , and the sheer novelty of the film . Gertrude Michael has the showy role of a bitchy actress intent on stopping the marriage between the show 's stars , Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson , as well as starring in the infamous " Sweet Marijuana " number ( which was also on a 70s Bette Midler album ) . So while the chorus girls shuffle around backstage , bumbling detective Victor McLaglen ogles the girls while he tries to solve the backstage murder of an unknown woman . We quickly learn that the maid ( Dorothy Stickney ) loves Brisson from afar , that the wardrobe lady ( Jessie Ralph ) is Brisson 's mother , and that the stage manager ( Jack Oakie ) butts into everything . Lots of plots twists among the musical numbers . The show 's best - known song is " Cocktails for Two . " Kitty Carlisle also sings the haunting " Where Do They Come From ? " And there 's a weird rhapsody that erupts into a Harlem specialty number featuring Duke Ellington ! Quite the cast . Some terrific acting here , especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney . Kitty Carlisle is quite good as well . Brisson is a total zero though . Charles Middleton plays Homer , Toby Wing plays Nancy , Donald Meek plays the doctor , and also see if you can spot Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball among the show girls .
neg	How many centuries will pass until the Japanese / Asian horror films abandon the long - haired ghost - woman shtick ? Admittedly , they 've managed to rip off " Ringu " a million times , and often it worked well - which just goes to show that originality is n't that much of a requirement in the horror genre ( or that I 'm very uncritical and easy to please ? ) . However , this time around I found myself a little restless , somewhat bored . It 's not a bad film , but it 's at least half - an - hour longer than it should be , with its absurd 110 minutes length . Compared to many other Japanese horror films , OMC lacks atmosphere and excitement . Plus , the ending is confusing : it makes no sense at all . As for the ring - tone : Miike could have come up with a melody that is more effective than that forgettable little thing . Even though it was played a dozen times I ca n't even remember it - that 's how scary it was . Speaking of Miike , for him this is something of a commercial venture , so if anyone thinks they might be getting perversion of the " Bijita Q " or " Audition " kind , they 're wasting their time .
pos	WHO 'S GOT THE GOLD ? is ( unfortunately ) the last of the HANZO THE RAZOR films , starring Shintaro Katsu as the title character - the multi - weapon proficient , authority - bucking samurai officer with the " unique " technique of raping confessions out of unwilling female informants until they " spill the beans " and beg for more ... This entry starts with Hanzo " uncovering " a woman who poses as a ghost to guard a lake that 's filled with bamboo trunks filled with gold stolen from the Treasury . This leads to Hanzo discovering a loan - sharking scheme and an orgy ring run by a blind monk . The requisite swordplay and rape / interrogation ensue - finalizing in a decent ending for this strange trilogy of films . Not quite as strong and enjoyable as THE SNARE ( part 2 of the series ... ) , but still great for fans of samurai sleaze and Japanese pinky - style films . 8/10
neg	' The Curse of Frankenstein ' sticks faithfully to Mary Shelley 's story for one word of the title , which would n't be so bad if the changes were any good at all . The tragedy of the creature destroying Frankenstein 's family has been completely excised and replaced with ... nothing . The heart and moral centre of the story is gone . It does n't help that this Frankenstein is a conniving , devious murderer ; he deserves everything he gets . The plot is basically a shallow checklist of Frankenstein clichés . Even taken on its own terms , this is rubbish : a bland , rambling film featuring a shite - looking creature with a pudding bowl haircut . As it 's the first of Hammer 's horror films , directed by Terence Fisher and starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee , its place in horror history is secure . But it 's crap .
pos	It 's sort of crazy , but I taped from TCM both , this german version of MGM 's " Anna Christie " , and the english one ... but I got to see this one first , 'cos I 'd heard that many people thought it was better than the english version . Without having seen the other one , I can not compare them , but anyway this is an excellent early talkie , with a straight - from - the - heart performance by Garbo . She looks very beautiful in this film , her face shines throughout , especially when Cameraman William Daniels , gets those gorgeous close - ups of her . The atmosphere of the film seems different from the regular MGM stuff made on that era , it looks very similar to french or german expressionistic films from the thirties , well it was directed by a great french director , Monsieur Jacques Feyder , who had directed Garbo in 1929 in " The Kiss " . Theo Shall is excellent and gives an absolutelly believable performance as Anna 's sweetheart , the hard - boiled , tough , sailor , who 's just a kid in man 's body . Also Hans Junkermann gives a very fine performance , as Anna 's alcoholic father and Salka Viertel too , as a good - hearted old cheap floozie . In all quite an experience , because it 's the only film were you can listen to Garbo speak in a foreign language ... 'cos all the other films she did in either Sweden or Germany , were during the Silent Era . Serious Flick .
neg	Saving Grace is surely one of the leading contenders for the ' How to Ruin an Adequate Film in the Final Few Minutes ' award . Naturally if you mix a quaint Cornish village - largely populated by retired genteel ladies - with a liberal dose of marijuana , a certain amount of silliness will ensue . However , the last seven minutes of the film descend into the totally ludicrous and is not even redeemed by being particularly funny . It is a real shame , because this comedy has the potential to be every bit as good as 1998 's Waking Ned Devine , which also portrayed a picturesque small village and its oddball inhabitants trying to extract themselves from a tricky situation . The protagonist of Saving Grace is middle - aged , recently widowed Grace Trevethyn , whose husband 's legacy of bad debts has forced her into an unconventional way of earning money . Helped by her gardener , Matthew , she turns her horticultural expertise to the lucrative cultivation of marijuana . Unfortunately , this leads her into confrontation with the local police , her husband 's creditors and a French drug baron . . . . . . . . . . whom all turn up at her greenhouse simultaneously . The relationship and rapport between Grace and Matthew is well - portrayed , and Brenda Blethyn gets the viewer emotionally involved with her likeable character - you can really feel what she is going through . The casting of the minor roles is excellent , even if some of them are rather outlandishly eccentric . However , the transformation of Jacques the drug lord into Grace 's romantic interest is highly implausible and does not fit the tone of the movie at all . And surely hydroponics is not such a revolution in the world of cannabis growing ? Sadly the film swaps gentle humour for slapstick and ends up being as fake as the marijuana plants .
pos	This could n't have been better . The strong restraints on Mike Sullivan 's expressions could n't have been portrayed in any other way . Tom Hanks delivers the best performance of his career . Young Tyler Hoechlin drives an emotional wheel ; playing the basis character for the story . And veteran Paul Newman gives one of his best character performances in a long time . This film is based on a bold graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner . This is a father / son story which basically employs the two candidates solely unfit for the roles . Mike Sullivan had no father as a child , so John Rooney took him in . Although a generous man , Mr. Rooney involved himself in organized crime . Therefore , the debt of Sullivan was only to be paid off in involving himself in the business . Now , Sullivan has a wife and two children and is trying to keep his children safe , but at the same time pay back his boss . The events to follow , will test Sullivan 's loyalty and embrace his family 's fate . With a great adaptation by David Self , the dialogue comes out seldomly , but yet very virtuous . The story unfolds in a beautiful 1930 's setting ( Brilliant Art Direction by Richard L. Johnson & Nancy Haigh ) covered with a dark rainy ( snow on the ground ) exterior . Driving the story , is Thomas Newman 's wonderful Irish score , settling in only when necessary . But the most important technical element in the film is Conrad L. Hall 's beautiful photography . This is some of the best cinematography I 've seen ; and I watch a lot of films . The scene when Mike and Michael are in the car , entering Chicago is quite impressive . The shot starts at the front of the car , revealing Mike(Hanks ) through the windshield . It subsequently dollys around to the side of the car , to see Michael(Hoechlin ) awakening and peering out his side window . As it continues , it trucks sideways and dollys back , completely around the car and reveals a gorgeous scenic 1930 's Chicago . With a great cast and crew , the principle man creates a brazenly amazing film . I 'm talking about Sam Mendes , who made his feature film debut in 1999 with American Beauty . ( won him various awards ) Before American Beauty , Mendes worked as a play director for the British Theater , but decided that he wanted to move on saying that there was nothing new for him in theater . With only two films , Sam Mendes has marked himself in my book as one of the great directors ( In a list of about twenty - five ) . The film illuminates a brazen genre that has its hits and misses and expresses the true theme brilliantly . The photography , acting and story is phenominal . I 'm still waiting for Scorcesee 's Gangs of New York , but for now , I 'm fully confident in saying that this is the " Best Film of the Year " . Considering it 's competition ( Signs , Insomnia , Minority Report ) that s a strong statement .
neg	A student filmmaker enlists a B - grade actress ( a delectably diva - ish MOLLY RINGWALD ! ) to complete the horror film that her mother ( a dreadfully dull Kylie Minogue ! ) tried to make 12 years ago . It 's a curious plot choice to say the least , as any Aussie horror fan knows that the genre is sadly lacking in women directors . The film has a curse on it , because Molly had to kill some psycho murderer on the original set . But she 's back , because she needs the exposure . Unfortunately , the curse is still there and people start dying on the " set . " Cut is an Aussie attempt at the modern " slasher , " but unfortunately it does n't bring anything new or exciting to the table . In fact , it rips half of Wes Craven 's 90s filmography . Lots of film - world name - dropping a la " Scream " ( except it 's Aussie name - dropping -- Jane Campion ... see how this is n't as funny ) and lots of " is this real or is this a movie " a la " New Nightmare . " The editing is bad , the music is annoying , the effects are laughable , almost everything is bad about this . Fortunately , the film can have a sense of humor : at one point , a well - dressed girl in the movie crew says to the owner of the house they are filming at : " Do n't worry , we 'll treat your house as if it were our own , " to which he responds , " that does n't mean anything to me , you look like you live in a dump ! " Ha ! And Molly 's ridiculous one - liners were enough to not regret renting this one . " You got any diet coke in here ? " ( as she rides in the film professor 's car ) and " Does anyone know where I can buy any tofu ? " ( the first thing she mutters on the set ) and " Where the hell is my agent ? " ( oh wait , that 's what I was thinking for her . )
pos	Mina Kumari exhibits more style and grace just moving from standing , to sitting on the floor than you can find in most other movies . The director has produced more memorable scenes of touching beauty than it would seem possible . The music and dancing is of the highest possible quality . You may notice in the first dance scene the director has all sorts of things occurring in the background : other girl dancing , a drunk falling down stairs , much activity , but he knew that we would be watching Mina dance and I 'll bet unless you viewed this many times , you did n't notice . All in all , perfection . J.Q.
neg	It looks to me as if the creators of " The Class Of Nuke ' Em High " wanted it to become a " cult " film , but it ends up as any old high school B - movie , only tackier . The satire feels totally overshadowed by the extremely steretyped characters . It 's very un - funny , even for a turkey .
pos	I can see why this film was Oscar - nominated for Best Live Action Short , as it was constructed masterfully . Even if you do n't particularly like the Blues ( though to me , this sounded much more like jazz ) , you can easily appreciate this film . It is simply very well made , though for the life of me , I ca n't see why director Gjon Mili only got to direct one film -- this one . In other words , the film is nominated and yet the director did n't get any sort of career boost . As for the black performers , I could understand this not causing their careers to shift into high gear , as unfortunately most of white society have indifference ( or worse ) for blacks or " that kind of music " . If you do watch this film , if you are n't particularly enjoying the earlier portion , skip ahead to about the 5:50 mark -- where it picks up considerably . When the lady stopped singing and the performers began to improvise , the pace improved quite a bit .
neg	I thought the film was good in parts.the start was exciting .the first 30 minutes of the film were good.the camera angles in the first 30 minutes were strange and i did not like it coz the were they not covering the actors entirely . i think the last 25 minutes of the film were really not that great from which we expect a lot in case of such films . the dialoques did not make sense and i do n't think they were very witty . i felt as if they were trying to copy films like phonebooth in terms of dialogues , but failed miserably.it seemed as if they many of the scenes between the actors were put for sake of it and did not make any sense to the story . the entire film features only law and caine . i do n't think it was a waste of time , its an OK film , but not gr8
pos	A team of archaeologists uncover a real treasure  the Crown of the Queen of Sheeba . From Egypt , the crown is to be transferred via steamship to San Francisco . But it wo n't be an easy journey . There are plenty of would - be thieves who would love to get their hands on the priceless jewels contained in the crown . Fortunately for all involved , Mr. Moto is on hand to guard the crown on its journey . However , that does n't mean someone wo n't try to get their hands on the treasure . After the disappointment of Mr. Moto 's Gamble , I went into Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation hoping for the best , but , admittedly , fearing the worst . But within the first 10 seconds of the film , I knew I would find it more enjoyable . I 'm a sucker for a 1930s style mystery that features anything to do with archaeological digs in Egypt . And seeing Moto disguised as a German archaeologist ( Imagine that , Peter Lorre playing a German ? ) , the beginning scenes really drew me in . While the movie may have quickly shifted to the less exotic San Francisco , it remained just as enjoyable . Dark , sinister characters lurking in the rainy night ; gunshots fired from open windows that narrowly miss the hero 's head ; sophisticated and supposed foolproof alarm systems just begging for someone to test them ; and master criminals believed to be dead  these are the kind of elements found in a lot of the really good 1930s mysteries that I love . And Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation 's got 'em all . A couple other bonuses for me included the always enjoyable Lionel Atwill in a nice little role , comic relief from G.P. Huntley that 's actually funny , and a return to form for Mr. Moto . I 've already mentioned his disguise in the movie 's opening scenes , well the athletic Moto comes out near the film 's finale . Moto is a like a Whirling Dervish of activity as he goes after his prey . All this and I have n't even mentioned the wonderful performance turned in by Lorre . Any way you look at it , Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation is a winner . As much as I hate that the Mr. Moto series had to end after this installment , it 's understandable when you think about it . WWII was just around the corner . And after Pearl Harbor , a movie with a Japanese hero would n't have gone over very well . At least the Mr. Moto series ended on a very positive note .
neg	Spoilers   Well , the one line summary says it all . Melville´s " Le samurai " is the original and there are elements of " Leon " . And they are better - much better ! In the " Samurai " Alain Delon is a lonely warrior / professional killer who keeps a bird in cage and is stealing cars for his jobs ( with so much suspense in these scenes ! ) . Even the end is exactly the same : the samurai seeks death in dignity and is getting shot with an empty gun in his hand . The world has changed he realizes and there is no place for the samurai in it . Delon is not killing so many people like the Ghost dog . But I guess Jarmusch liked " Leon " very much or even " Desperado " by Rodriguez . So he added this , too . And let me guess : the girl will become a professional like Ghost dog ( like Natalie Portman in " Leon " ) ? So what was Jarmusch thinking after all ? Where is the unique , the original thought in this movie ? I can´t see the point in making carbon ( celluloid ) copies . A 4/10 rating by Macaulay Connor
pos	On the surface , this is an above - average post - war romantic comedy . Beneath the veneer , it is MGM character actor stunt - casting at its funniest . The leads are straightforward , but all the secondaries are cast much against type . Margaret Hamilton ( aka Wicked Witch of the West ) , Edward Everett Horton ( professional obsessive - compulsive fussbudget ) , and Sig Ruman ( the Marx Brothers ' nemesis in _ Night In Casablanca _ and the always - wonderful _ Night At The Opera _ ) , playing a well - intentioned gang trying to bring the two leads together , instead of driving them apart as their " usual " characters would do . It also pokes fun at many romantic - comedy conventions , which is another indication that this could be not so much a " straight " romantic comedy , as it is a wry send - up of the many post - war romantic comedies & their 2-dimensional , stock characters . I 've seen it only once , with interruptions , so I ca n't be positive , but this movie may be one of those that worked better in the context of the time at which it was made , but is less successful now that viewers " see " these secondary characters through a completely different lens . I 'm assuming this is the case when I give it 9 stars . I thought it was hysterical .
neg	Why oh why do people take good material and feel the need to change it some how ? Having read the book on which this film is allegedly based a couple of years ago , I can say that there is little if anything from the original book . I went into this film with low expectations - i knew it would have a crappy telemovie feel to it - but it even failed to meet these . This is not a prequel - the only relationship it has with the original is the name . This is not the story of Carlito Brigante , it is the story of a totally different character who 's been given the same name . They have just totally spat in the face of every Carlito 's Way fan out there ; adding insult to injury by casting Luis Guzman , who plays a crucial character in the original movie , in a different role . What 's most disappointing is that now that this film has been made no other film will be made addressing the original , untouched material of the book Carlito 's Way - something I really would have liked to have seen . I felt the same way about Chopper - they have four books as well as interviews worth of fantastic non - fictional material and could have made a brilliant biography of Australia 's most feared underworld figure , instead they made a ho - hum film about a deranged but strangely pathetic small time crook ( though Eric Bana 's performance was spot - on ) . Now we will never get to see Carlito 's real initial rise and fall . The three stars is because , looking at it purely as a stand - alone flick , it is not so appalling - there are some decent performances ( Jay Hernandez is no Carlito but he could be good in other roles ) and the story is not too bad . Even Puffy Combs suits his role . But they totally misunderstand the nature of the underworld at that time ( I am a bit of a crime - non - fiction buff)- something which the original film and the books got right ( having been written by then attorney and now judge Edwin Torres ) . The fact is though , it 's not a stand alone - it 's perhaps the most disappointing prequel ever filmed .
pos	This video rocked ! Eddie is one of the funniest comics I have ever seen . Not only does he have class , he makes some of the funniest observations on history and culture that I have ever seen . Eddie is the most original and most intelligent comic I 've seen in a VERY long time . Tell all those other stand - ups to get off the stage and let this " executive " reign !
neg	The Minion is about ... well , a minion . A servant of Satan and whose goal is to get the key that will unlock the door where his master is trapped . He is some sort of demon who possess human beings and when the body dies will possess another . Anyone who happens to be possessed will go on some berserker rage . Dolph Lundgren plays Lukas , a member of a secret order of Templars , who is tasked to keep the key away from the minion . The movie begins a thousand years ago , in the Middle East where a couple of knight templars flee from the minion . Then flash forward to 1999 , where the key winds up somewhere underground in New York . An archeologist is assigned to study / dig the place where the key was found . Needless to say , the minion is after the key , and the movie becomes a long winded chase scene between the minion and Lukas and archeologist . The movie , is just that , a low budget B - movie flick . The movie lacks energy , and just trods along . You 'll follow the chase but you wo n't ever feel involved in the story which willfully takes ideas from previous movies ( especially The Terminator films ) . The fight scenes with the minion is troublesome , in that you never get the sense of how good or how bad a warrior this demon is . It " skillfully " becomes a one - man army when fighting a squad of templars but sucks when it comes to one - on one . And it 's supposed to be around for a long time . All this goes to show that any sense of logic is just thrown down the drain for convenience . The whole idea of a secret order of Templars , a door to hell , and the key is n't well explained . We are merely to accept that they just exist . The movie seems to have been made with the feeling there 's not much potential to the story but only enough to make a few bucks . Dolph Lundgren sure looks like he wish he were somewhere else . The verdict : 2 of 5 stars .
pos	Laurence Fishburne is a fine actor , and deserves respect for trying this , but he is not in a class with the great Shakespeareans like Olivier and Welles ; and he further suffers from Kenneth Branagh . This Irishman , always brilliant , cleanly steals the show away . Olivier recognized that potential in his production , and cast Iago with someone he knew he could upstage . I did n't nearly realize the possibilities of Iago , Shakespeare 's most evil character , but Branagh shows us the depths . Nice to see the views of Venice , too .
neg	" Triumph of Love " is proof that not every Comédie - Française author who uses cross - dressing disguised courtship like Shakespeare is worth seeing .   Or maybe something was lost in the translation of this adaptation of Marivaux , a Commedia Dell Arte - inspired playwright of whom Brittannica says : " His nuanced feeling and clever wordplay became known as marivaudage . "   While Mira Sorvino has fun dangling three mixed - up romances , her pants role was n't even up to Cherubino in " Marriage of Figaro . " The herky - jerky editing is annoying and just seems to indicate that a lot of takes were needed for each long speech . Best was Fiona Shaw as the fooled spinster , as well as the costumes . The glimpses of audience we see and the closing curtain call to wink that this is all artifice does n't really help . ( originally written 5/29/2002 )
pos	This movie came and went in the theaters . Due to the nature of it you can see why it was n't well received . It was unfairly panned because of its subject matter more than the actual film itself . Higher Learning is not spectacular but it was good film that tried to talk about a feared subject in America : racism . Plot / Story : Higher Learning is mostly centered around Malik(played by Omar Epps ) , a naive track star who is has to deal with not being fast enough , and a stern professor(played by Laurence Fishburne ) . He befriends Fudge(Ice Cube ) as well as a gorgeous lady named Deja(Tyra Banks ) . Later on they end up having to deal with some skinheads on campus . Remy(play by Michael Rapaport ) is confused kid who ends up befriending some local skinheads on campus . Once they impose their views on him , he becomes as racist as they are . Opinion : Higher Learning is not without its flaws : Character development is scarce , okay performances by Omar Epps , Tyra Banks and the leader of the skinheads(whose name I forgot ) , Busta Rhymes does n't fit in this movie at all . Plus women turning gay after being abused by men was cliché ' before this film so you know I did n't like that part of the film with Kristy Swanson . Other than that , this movie was n't half bad . Laurence Fishburne was good as Professor Phipps(even though I could do without the accent ) , Fudge was Ice Cube 's best performance and Michael Rapaport was good as the confused Remy . All in all it was one of John Singleton 's best movies and is one is one of the reasons I frown on the rubbish he puts out now . Cinema needs more movies like Higher Learning , Mississippi Burning and American History X and less movies like Baby Boy , 2 Fast 2 Furious and a very pointless remake of Shaft .
neg	This is one of those films that I could only sit through once . Charlotte Henry is fine -- in fact , all the actors were fine . The problem was in the script , the dialog , the direction , the editing , the sets and the special effects . Granted , this was 1933 , but it really creaked . Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen , Gary Cooper , W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable ( there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming ) . The movie just clumped along with no cohesion . Much of Lewis Carrols spirit , humor and continuity are missing . What a pity ! It 's such a great book . I would recommend Disney 's 1951 version .
pos	This film would usually classify as the worst movie production ever . Ever . But in my opinion it is possibly the funniest . The horrifying direction and screenplay makes this film priceless . I bought the movie whilst sifting through the bargain DVD 's at my local pound shop . Me and some friends then watched it , admittedly whilst rather drunk . It soon occurred that this was n't any normal film . Instead a priceless relic of what will probably be James Cahill 's last film . At first we were confused and were screaming for the DVD player to be turned off but thankfully in our abnormal state no - one could be bothered . Instead we watched the film right through . At the end we soon realised we had found any wasters dream , something that you can acceptably laugh at for hours , whilst laughing for all the wrong reasons . We soon showed all our other friends and they too agreed , this was n't a work of abysmal film . This was a film that you can truly wet yourself laughing at . This was a film that anyone can enjoy . This was genius .
neg	I just watched this movie . In one word : sucky ! The story is bad , the acting is , if possible , even worse . The movie has one or two nice moments , but that s it and having those two small good moments , does n't make up for anything in between , before or after those moments . A montrocity of a movie , not even worth watching on tv ...
pos	I went into The Straight Story expecting a sad / happy type drama with nice direction and some good acting . These I got . What I was n't expecting was an allegory for the trials of human existence . Leave it to Lynch to take a simple story about a 300 mile trip on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition . If you did n't notice , watch it again , paying attention to the ages of the people Alvin meets , the terrain he 's driving through , the reactions people give him , the kinds of discussions he has ( one of the first is about pregnancy and children , one of the last is outside of a cemetery ) . The last road he drives down is particulary haunting in this context , as it narrows and his fear and nervousness mount . The last mechanical failure could be seen as a death , and the miraculous rebirth of his engine relating to an afterlife , in which he achieves the desired reunion . I only hope some of the people who branded this as a slow sappy melodrama take the time to watch with a more holistic attention .
neg	If you 're in the mood for some dopey light entertainment , this will pass the time . If you expect one jot of plausibility , do n't bother . To me , the dance scene looked like it was exaggerated for comic effect ; it did n't look especially hot or skilled .
pos	" Midnight Cowboy " is one of those films that s been proclaimed a masterpiece with good reason - it really is one of the finest films ever made in America . Its both artistically valid yet entirely accessible and commercial . No wonder it was a huge success when initially released . But be warned , its also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made . The characters are memorable , well - developed , and ultimately tragic . The filmmakers should be applauded for not giving us the Hollywood ending , something which was basically mandatory by the 80s . Still , this is why I treasure the years of 1967 to 1977 for American film . Its a time when well - made , innovative , and most of all bleak films could be made with the big budgets that Hollywood could offer . All this was over by the time " Star Wars " was released . The direction by John Schlesinger makes the material work . It combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing . Unlike many other films featuring these psychedelic effects , " Midnight Cowboy " has aged quite well . Its still as powerful now as it was when initially released . The acting however is what makes this a masterpiece . The characters ' backgrounds are never fully explained , but the performances make them completely developed . Both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic ( despite their sometimes reprehensible actions ) . Plus , being a fan of vintage exploitation films , I loved the scenes set on the infamously sleazy 42nd street . " Midnight Cowboy " is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made . ( 10/10 )
neg	Wesley Snipes is James Dial , an assassin for hire , agent of the CIA and pure bad - ass special operative . During his free time Dial dons a cowboy hat and breeds horses with macho names such as Beauty . Enter agent Collins , his supervising officer . Enter a new assignment - kill a terrorist that is in UK custody . Of course the United Kingdom being an allied state is a great place for covert ops and head - shots outside of courtrooms . The assassination is a big success apart from the fact , that the escape plan blew . So Dial 's partner and local liaison gets killed in action trying to escape the police , whilst Dial becomes hot property with the London coppers trying to get to him and CIA trying to dispose of him . Fortunately for Dial the safe - house is routinely visited by a teenager Emily Day ( Eliza Bennett ) , who loves hanging out with cold - blooded killers with arrest warrants and help them escape from the evil UK law enforcement ... With a script like that need I say more ? On the plus side Wesley Snipes is Wesley Snipes ( be that a pro or a con ) and the movie is quite engaging . On the minus editing is very disjointing and has a hurl effect on the stomach .
pos	Kate Beckinsale is excellent as the manipulative and yet irresistibly charming Emma in this TV - adaptation of Jane Austen´s novel . When I read that novel I was sometimes quite doubtful whether the protagonist really deserved to be considered the heroine of the story : for honestly , she is so terribly self - righteous and scheming that one is tempted to dislike her seriously . Kate Beckinsale´s interpretation , however , saves Emma from herself so to speak : she is portrayed with all the innocence and generosity of her character in full view , and one can´t help but give in and like ( not to say love ) her in spite of her less amiable qualities . Kate Beckinsale is the main , but not the only , reason why this TV - series is so delightful ; Raymond Coulthard is perfect as Mr. Frank Churchill , expressing this character´s personal magnetism to the full ( which is all the more conspicuous because of this role being not very well handled by Ewan McGregor in the 1996-screen adaptation of Emma ) , and Mark Strong , Samantha Morton , Bernard Hepton , and Olivia Williams are all as they should be in their respective roles . This production is , in short , a great achievement and one to view many times with increasing pleasure .
neg	I usually start by relaying the premise of the film , but before anyone makes any hasty judgments about my review , let me preface it by saying that I 'm someone who likes most films ( just check my other reviews ) . Alone in the Dark is a film by director Uwe Boll , whose film right before this one was House of the Dead ( 2003 ) . Like Alone in the Dark , it was also a film adaptation of a video game . Almost everyone hated it . Well , I loved it . I even gave it a 10 out of 10 ! My point in stating this ( which will surely turn some readers off immediately ) is that if even I hated Alone in the Dark , there must be something wrong with it . The Premise : Who am I kidding ? Attempting to state a premise for this film is about as easy as trying to balance the United States ' budget , but here it goes anyway . Some archaeologists discovered evidence of some lost American Indian tribe . The Indian tribe apparently had discovered some means of broaching the " second world " , which was evil in nature . The bad stuff wiped them out , but not before they could lock the door to the evil world and throw away the key . Later , some scientist / government researcher who had been experimenting with the paranormal , and specifically this tribe , decided to experiment on some kids , to try to produce some kind of hybrid with the second world . ( Believe it or not -- everything up to this point and then some is told to us in a written prologue to the film -- it 's just white text scrolling across a black screen with a voice - over also reading it to us ) . Then , there was something about the kids being in an orphanage , but the government takes them back out , and then a bunch of people are searching for archaeological relics , and there are super humans roaming around , and a bunch of military people are called in and on and on . In fact , the exposition never really stops . It 's like a neverending backstory from hell . There are enough ideas here to fill at least 10 films , maybe 25 . But not one of them is presented in a coherent way to create one good film . In addition to the mystical lost Indian tribe and the superhumans , we also get monsters that resemble a cross between Alien and a werewolf , worms that invade your body and turn into snake - like aliens , tunneling worms underground , zombies , Starship Trooper - like wars , evil scientists , underground lairs , gold mines , spooky warehouses , impalements , big mostly unused museums , government conspiracies , golden trunks pulled out of the sea , nuns , explosions , complex backstabbing plots , a very ambiguous romance , car chases , home invasions , kitchen sinks . . . wait , I ca n't remember if that last one was in the film . Even more amazingly ( amusingly ? ) , in Fangoria # 240 , producer Shawn Williamson was quoted as saying , " We 're spending much more time on story , being very meticulous about that " . Tara Reid called Alone in the Dark " a smarter film " . Let me not mislead anyone . A lot of that stuff above might sound yummy to the potential audience for this film , but the problem is that nothing has the slightest connection to anything else . I usually had no idea what any setting 's relation was to any other setting , why we were there , or what anyone was doing ( at least when each scene began ) . It 's just a random mishmash of settings and clichés , as if director Uwe Boll had 250 unrelated ideas in a hat and pulled them out like lottery numbers . Then when he was done , he and editor Richard Schwadel decided to cut the film by using dice , then reassembled it by throwing the I Ching . Sometimes the film plays like an extended director 's reel ( which is a combination of short , varied , unrelated scenes that directors circulate to try to get work ) , but perhaps that 's being too generous . I 'm not sure Boll would get work if this were his reel .   Just as I tend to at least like most films , I tend to like most actors and most performances . It 's very rare that I say that a performance was bad . Well , Tara Reid was bad here -- and I 'm someone who usually likes Reid . I do n't know what happened . For a large percentage of the film , they just move her around the set like a prop . They might as well have just bought a blow - up doll . That would have saved them money that they could have used for some cgi ghosts and vampires in castle and graveyard settings . Maybe they chose to move her around like a pretty piece of driftwood after they saw the dailies of her mumbling nonsense dialogue in a monotone that 's usually reserved for entertaining mother - in - laws . And speaking of that dialogue , a lot of Alone in the Dark plays like a Godzilla film without Godzilla . By that , I mean that it 's a lot of pseudo - scientific gobbledy - gook . At least in Godzilla films , there 's a campiness to it , because they know how ridiculous it is , and there 's a big payoff in that we get to see Godzilla destroy downtown and battle a giant gnat with radioactive death beams shooting from its eyes or something . Just what Stephen Dorff and Christian Slater are doing here , besides overacting and filing lawsuits against their agents , is difficult to say . I ca n't say that I thought anyone in the film had a decent performance , although maybe Slater at least saw the cigar . I think that 's unprecedented for me . Still , I did n't give this film a 1 . There was some competent cinematography , even if Boll and Schwadel made mincemeat out of it , and the hard rock tunes over the end credits were good . Heck , even the novelette prologue was n't so bad . I actually thought the film had promise at that point . But this may just be the worst film I 've ever seen with a budget of 20 million or more .
pos	" In Cold Blood " , adapted by director Richard Brooks from Truman Capote 's famous novel , deals with the brutal and senseless murder of a family of four by a pair of hapless criminals . The film excels as a character study of the killers , particularly trigger - man Perry Smith ( Robert Blake ) . The cast includes few recognizable names but they nevertheless bring the story to life with ease . Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are excellent together as two criminals with disparate personalities . They play off of each other effortlessly while Blake also gets plenty of opportunities to explore his character 's idiosyncrasies . The rest of the cast is merely average and is n't worth remarking on . Richard Brooks received Oscar nominations for both his script and his direction . In my opinion , both were excellent , though the script does miscalculate with some ill - advised narration in the late stages . The Oscar - nominated cinematography by Conrad Hall is also top - notch , as is the editing . Also worthy of note is the jazzy score by Quincy Jones which secured the last of the film 's four Oscar nominations . Unlike so many other crime films , this one does n't glamorize violence . Brooks turns the killers into pitiable characters rather than flatly condemning them . Whether or not you agree with that sentiment the film does present an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach . I recommend the film for this reason and also for the expertise with which the technical aspects are handled .
neg	I picked this movie on the cover alone thinking that i was in for an adventure to the level of " Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom " . Unfortunately I was in for a virtual yawn . Not like any yawn i have had before though . This yawn was so large that i could barely find anything of quality in this movie . The cover described amazing special effects . There were none . The movie was so lightweight that even the stereotypes were awfully portrayed . It does give the idea that you can solve problems with violence . Good if you want to teach your kids that . I do n't . Keep away from this one . If you are looking for family entertainment then you might find something that is more inspiring elsewhere .
pos	It surprises me that I actually got the courage to watch the bio flick or flicks " Che : Parts 1 & 2 " . Why ? Because if my Cuban exile parents would ever found out I saw this movie about this despicable mass murderer of the Cuban revolution , I would be grounded for life . Hey wait ? I am an adult , they ca n't ground me no mas . Director Steven Soderbergh , and newbie commie ( sorry Steven , but I had to take Soder shots here ) divides the movie in two partes on Commander Ernesto " Che " Guevara 's revolutionary life . " Che : Part 1 " presents how Che in the mid 1950 's joined Fidel Castro 's guerilla crew in their revolutionary quest to overthrow Cuban President Fulgencio Batista 's regime ; which as we all know was a revolutionary success for them , but a gargantuan guerilla disaster to many Cubans as it revolted into Communism . " Che : Part 2 " presents Che trying to revolutionize the T - Shirt industry by pitching T - Shirts with his appalling bearbado face to T - Shirt manufacturers . OK , I am che - chatting a lot of crap towards your way ! I meant to say the ' Che : Part 2 " focuses on Che in the late 60 's trying to bring back the revolution , this time to a poverty - stricken Bolivia , but with far different results . In fact , Che ended up being dead meat enchelada when he was captured and killed by the Bolivian militia in 1967 . Soderbergh does not include the in - between time of those two instances in Che 's life when he commanded the despicable La Cabana Fortress Prison in Cuba , where he mass murdered many Cubans who opposed Communism . That is where I think Soderbergh executed a cinematic injustice by not showing the viewers how atrocious Guevara really was . I did decide to see " Che " in hopes that Soderbergh would not glamorize him , but instead present how disturbed he really was . Unfortunately , Soderbergh did not do the latter and sadly decided to present Guevara as a Revolutionary hero , which he was not . He was a sick man who thank God is now probably at the bottom of the devil barrel . Now , I do have to be an objectivistic reviewer and must admit that Benicio Del Toro 's performance as Che was extremely commanding , and worthy of merit . And that Demian Bichir was a haunting dead - ringer as Fidel Castro in his meticulous performance . But the rest of the cast of " Che " was primarily comprised of mediocre performances of actors portraying Guerilla soldiers . And as much as I do admire Matt Damon , why did Sodebergh throw him in the revolutionary mix in a Spanish - speaking cameo performance portraying a Bolivian delegate ? Soderbergh did not have to present this biopic which is mostly " too much talk and not enough action " in 4 hours and 30 minutes . We have had too much of Che already , even posthumously with those ridiculous t - shirts , so why give us too much more of him ? But I guess when you have the Del Toro by the horns ( as you did here Steven ) , I guess it is your saving grace for not totally executing " Che : Parts 1 & 2 " . * * * Average
neg	Okay , so the introduction , with its hokey offer of a free coffin to anyone who dies of fright during the film , is so lame it 's funny . And so the first " skull scene " is so drawn out and un - suspenseful it 's funny . The actual plot of the movie is somewhat decent , there 's at least a little bit of genuine food for thought in the behavior of the characters , and the plot twist is decent as horror flicks go . The acting is average , not truly bad .   Altogether , this movie does n't quite fall flat in the way a 1/10 movie would . It 's not terrible enough to get the lowest rating or even second lowest . If I just read the screenplay , I 'd say there was potential for this to be a decent movie . It 's just that the horrid direction and production that ruin the movie . So it 's a bad movie , but there are much worse ones out there .
pos	This is a run - of - the - mill nature porn movie . By porn , I do n't mean sex . I mean gratuitous images of ( for example ) thousands of birds together , or hundreds of walruses , or a giant waterfall or iceberg . Several of the shots in the film seem to exist solely to make their way into the trailer , to get people into theatres to see it for all of ten seconds before it disappears never to be seen again for the rest of the film . There is almost no plot in this film . Told to expect a story of three animal families , " better than March of the Penguins " , the movie simply does n't deliver . The blame rests in three key areas : ( 1 ) the writers who gave James Earl Jones some of the worst lines to narrate in nature film history , ( 2 ) the music team who over - dramatized everything to tell you what you should be feeling , even when the film fails to motivate , and lastly but most importantly ( 3 ) the editors who had the story jump from place to place with no rhyme or reason , no continuity , no flow , sucking the life out of the entire film -- a film about life . When we got to the whales halfway through the film , I sunk back in my seat with dread , hoping against hope that the film was more than halfway through , and that I 'd be able to survive the long endurance test along with the animals on screen . There was also almost no science in the film at all . They attributed hot and cold ( all of it , not just the seasons ) solely to the Earth 's tilt , ignoring the fact that we 'd have even greater extremes from location to location if there was no tilt because the poles would never warm . And it would be worst if we had no rotation ( relative to revolution ) like Mercury , because half the planet would bake and the other half would freeze . Then near the end they used the phrase " humans and animals " , as if humans are not animals , somehow exempt from the laws of nature . So much for science . I must credit the camera work , however , and again that is why I call this nature porn . Everything from super - slow - motion to what appears to be a finely - tuned mechanically - controlled time - lapse photography , was put to use to provide some ( and I caution , only " some " ) stunning moments that do raise the bar compared to other nature films . That said , I am not convinced that it was all nature on the screen . Some of the shots showing the great watering hole in Africa , as it changed from season to season seemed like CGI to me . A director might have expected such suspicion and built in other shots to demonstrate that it 's all natural , but they did n't do that . For a film about Earth , I had expected a lot more of Earth to be shown . What we saw was pristine . We had to take the narrator 's word for it that some species are at risk due to climate changes . They did n't show us evidence of it . They did n't show us Alberta 's poisonous tailing ponds visible from space . They did n't show us the great Pacific trash whorl . They did n't show us a nighttime picture of human light pollution around the planet . These are as much Earth as anything else . Why cover it up for a feel - good whitewash ?   My last criticism of the content is of predation . Any time a predator was shown on the screen actually hunting prey , the music turned almost into that Mt Doom scene from Lord of the Rings , with the predator portrayed as some kind of Sauron ultimate - evil character . But predators are n't evil . They perform a necessary service , ensuring that the best members of the prey species survive . We are predators ourselves . Any time the predator caught the prey , we immediately cut away to something else , to sort of pretend that death and eating do n't really happen . The final insult was the " dad " polar bear being left to die after he dared to try to eat . " Bad bear ! Bad ! " , you can almost hear them say . On to the presentation itself . My theatre may be in part to blame for this , but maybe not . I had expected to see something with greater clarity than I could see on my own HDTV LCD at home . But the picture was blurry , and was presented in the same 16:9 ratio I could get at home , instead of the wider ratio many films come in these days . And during one action - packed scene near the end , the film ( I ca n't imagine this happening digitally , from how it looked ) was damaged , and we lost several of the colors , eventually blacking out completely . That repeated about three times . If they actually do plant a tree on my behalf , it will have been worth it . But how will I know ?
neg	I still find it difficult to comprehend that a movie as bad as this could be made in Hollywood . The acting and story is simply pathetic & the direction is awful . I do n't see any logic behind this trash except may be that the director had nothing good to do . I took me ten minutes to realize that i had wasted my precious thirty rupees . It filled me with dismay that i was going to waste some more time of my life on this crap . I bet the movie was made in less than a day . I do n't know what category it falls into . Please , avoid this movie at all costs , just do anything , even bang your head against walls but do n't go for this movie .
pos	This flick is sterling example of the state of erotic B - movies : bad porn movies without the hardcore sex . The plot in this one is n't so bad as these things go ; it involves a female lawyer trying to prove her lover is innocent of killing his wife . The rest of the movie , however , leaves something to be desired . Bad acting , bad direction , bad looking woman , bad sets , bad cinematography , bad sound and bad sex scenes . The filmmakers should learn the difference between raunchy and erotic . They do n't even have the common sense to have Gabriella Hall naked or in a love scene .   How dumb is that ?
neg	... though for a film that seems to be trying to market itself as a horror , there was a distinct lack of blood . There was also a distinct lack of skilled directing , acting , editing , and script - writing . Jeremy London put in one of most appalling performances I 've ever seen - his " descent into the maelström " of madness is achingly self - aware and clumsy . Oh look at him twitch ! Oh look at him drink strong spirits ! Oh look at him raise his brow , and cock his head at a jaunty angle ! Oh look at his unwashed , greasy dark hair ! Oh listen to his affectedly husky voice ! He must be a tortured artist / writer / genius ! Oh , yes , out comes the poet - shirt - it 's another boy who thinks he 's Byron . ( Or Poe . ) Oh for the love of ... did someone give this guy a manual on " How To Act Good " or did they just pull him out of a cardboard box somewhere , the defunct little plastic toy - prize in a discontinued brand of bargain - bin cereal . Okay , that was a stupid line - but that 's only because London 's performance has melted my brain with its awfulness . Katherine Heigl is cute , and very briar rose , but has yet to grow into her acting shoes in this film - she delivered her lines like she was being held up , in fact , her whole performance was very wooden , her poses as stiff as her lines - who knows , perhaps she was just reacting to , and trying to neutralise , Jeremy London 's flailing excesses , but if that 's the case , she takes it too far . Notable is Arie Verveen as Poe - while his character 's role is confused , he delivers the best performance of the piece . He , quite simply , looks right , but it 's more than that - he has some sort of depth , I believed that he had a life beyond the dismal two - dimensional quality of the rest of the characters . Huh , maybe it 's just because I like Poe , and could thus just let my mind wander and invent while he was on screen - whatever , he had an interest factor otherwise missing . The rest of the characters are a faceless blur - there are all the usual caricatures : the perky blonde best - friend who 's a bit of a floozy ; the smitten local cop who 's a bit of a dork ; the protective older man who perhaps has too much un - fatherly interest in our heroine ; the scheming old witch , etc . , etc . , yawn , yawn .   As with the ' distinct lack of blood for a horror movie ' issue , none of the themes that they mention ( and that London 's character mentions - so scathingly - in his attack on Poe 's writing ) are followed through on . As another reviewer said - there was potential here : murder , incest , - genuinely shocking stuff , but instead they skirt away from the issues , and cut away from the violence ( a raised candlestick swinging through the air - closing in on it 's victim - then --- cut to black ! This is fine in a Noirish traditional horror , indeed , it 's expected , and is fondly received when it happens - it 's a dear convention , especially when accompanied by fake lightning bolts and intense Siouxie eye makeup - but in ' Descendant ' it just comes across as clumsy , or as though the editor got queasy at the last minute and cut it out . ) This could have either been a very tense psychological thriller - the horror of palingenesis / delusion / madness - or a simple ( and fun ) slasher movie : it tries to be both , or neither ( something new and exciting ! ) , but either way it fails dismally . The only horror element of this entire movie is it 's epic dullness . I think the editor ( if there was one at all ) must have been drunk when s / he chopped this thing up - there are awkwardly foreshortened scenes ; scenes that appeared to be out of order ( but that could have just been the poor script ) . LIkewise the director & cinematographer - there were some very strange shots and framing that I think were meant to be tributes to Hitchcock or Browning , but just ended up looking silly ( again , fine in a noir , but this was trying to be something else . ) The whole thing perhaps may have been funny ( in that way that previous reviewers have mentioned - " OMG how did this get made ? ! ? " ) if I had been in the mood for some trash- bagging , unfortunately for me I had settled on the couch , with the lights down low , with the express intention of scaring myself silly - this is a very poor film , and I 'm afraid I ca n't recommend it to people , not even for laughs . Please , please , do n't waste your time or money on this - either borrow a real horror / thriller film , or find yourself a copy of Poe 's fantastical tales , either way , you 'll have a far more enjoyable and frightening night than you could ever hope to achieve with this rubbish .
pos	This has always been one of my favourite movies , and will always be . Over the last few years I have become a 50 's / 60 's Sci - fi freak , trying to collect all of the better ones that were made back then . I love lots of things about them from how corny they could be to how technically correct some of them were . The great colours and the sets get me going too . It 's a pity when they re - make some of these good old movies ; they nearly always stuff it up , - just look at the recent re - do of The day the Earth stood still , it 's utter garbage ! ! Forbidden Planet is one of the benchmark space films of all time , and now they 're trying to re - make it too , and I shudder to think what the new one will be like ! To my mind , some things , such as fantastic classic movies , should just be left alone to be what they are , classic examples of great attempts at telling simple stories , and giving people a thrill in the process . Once they add all the techno - crap that we have available now , the film just seems to be more dog - meat from the Hollywood sausage factory , - nothing special at all . By the way , I notice that the astronauts ' uniforms in Forbidden Planet were also used for " Queen of Outer Space " ! That just tells you that the budgets were a bit lower back then , does n't it ? Hey , less money and better films , hmmm .... Great performances in this movie from Leslie Nielsen , in a serious role , and Anne Francis , Walter Pidgeon ( who has always been one of my favourite actors ) , Earl Holiman , and of course Robby the Robot ! The special effects are fantastic , and the storyline is not too far - fetched . This is a great sci - fi experience !
neg	It was agonizingly bad movie . It will eat your heart out while you watch it . I beg you : do n't watch this movie ! You will hate you losing 1,5 hours of your lifetime ! It 's not as some movies that are so bad that you can watch those and enjoy ... this movie is boring as ... there is nothing as boring as this movie . You will hate yourself after watching this movie till the end . And you will hate yourself that you did n't listen to me . I hate myself . I tortured myself and I did watch this movie to the end . Now excuse me , I will shot myself . I have seen all . Please . Read this very carefully . Do n't watch this film . Please !
pos	Wealthy psychiatrist Lindsay Crouse has just published her first novel and is feeling down about her profession feeling that it 's hopeless to help her patients . A young gambling junkie client asks her to help him pay off his debts if he truly wants to help him get better . Here she gets involved with Joe Mantegna . To reveal any more of the plot would spoil one hell of a fun movie and ' House of Games ' may very well be the best con movie I 've seen . David Mamet wrote and directed this gem that 's full of snappy dialogue , great one - liners , and enough twists to keep you guessing til the end . Crouse is perfect as the uptight psychiatrist needing a change and Mantegna tops her as the devilishly sly con - man . And with the exception of a coincidence in the last quarter of the movie , the film is in utter control of it 's audience ; and we are loving the con . * * * out of * * * *
neg	According to IMDb , as well as to every other website that holds a review ; this " thing " does n't have a director . Well , that would surely explain a lot ! Just a bunch of people that gathered together to shoot some perverted porn sequences and throw in an ultra - thin storyline about devil - worshiping and women sacrifices inside the walls of a secluded sanitarium . " Hardgore " is a prime example of totally demented 70 's smut , as it 's really made with a minimum of production values and scripting inspiration . Horror movies about satanic cults were hugely popular during the early 70 's and pornography as well , so why not combine the two ? Here we have a simplistic story about a young nymphomaniac girl who 's committed to a mental asylum , and from the first night already , she 's drawn into a network of drugs , psychedelic orgies , rape , torture and dildo - action . Really , a LOT of dildo - action . The friendly lesbian nurse tries to warn her , but she has her throat slit even the same night . The horror aspects are truly poorly elaborated , going from laughably un - scary Satan masks to virulent severed penises attacks . The photography and acting performances are almost intolerably amateurish , but what do you expect from a film that features footage of sperm - firing dildos and talking amputated male reproduction organs ? Leading lady Justina Lynn is a rather good looking girl with a ravishing body , but most of her co - stars ( male & female ) are hideous and excessively haired sleaze balls .
pos	Sandwiched in between San Francisco and Captains Courageous two of Spencer Tracy 's greatest parts is this very curious film about war and the effects it has on some people . They Gave Him A Gun stars Spencer Tracy and Franchot Tone in the only film they ever made together and Gladys George as the woman who loves them both . Tracy and Tone are a couple of World War I draftees , Tone is a weak character who almost goes over the hill in boot camp , but Tracy stops him . Tracy is still playing the lovable blowhard , younger Wallace Beery type that MGM envisioned for him when they signed him away from Fox .   Over at the front Tone gets an opportunity and takes it when during a fight he manages to get to a church tower that peers down on a German machine gun nest . He 's learned to shoot by now and he does a Sergeant York . But Alvin C. York was never changed by the war the way Tone has . Wounded in the fight Tone convalesces at a hospital with Gladys George looking out for him . Tracy goes AWOL himself to visit his pal and he and George get something going . Later on when Tracy is reported missing in action , Tone and George marry . Tracy 's brokenhearted when he comes back and learns of the marriage , but takes sit in stride .   The rest of the film is dealing with Tone applying the the wartime skills he 's learned to the gangster trade . He 's a hit - man now and George does n't really know what he does for a living . I think you can figure the rest out . The part of the film that gave me some trouble is that I ca n't believe Gladys George could n't figure it out . She 's a street smart girl , her part is very much like the one she played in The Roaring Twenties opposite James Cagney . Speaking of The Roaring Twenties , Humphrey Bogart 's character development there is similar to Tone 's although he was not the central character of the movie . In fact there are elements of They Gave Him A Gun that are to be found in Taxi Driver and in Clint Eastwood 's classic , The Unforgiven .   The World War I battle sequences are very well staged by director Woody Van Dyke . For some reason Leonard Maltin panned this film , I think it 's a lot better than he gave it credit .
neg	I could n't give this film a bad rating or bad review for two reasons : Robin Williams and Toni Collete . The film has the potential of being a thriller and there are some slight disturbing elements that lean to the psychological which was something the film could have focused a little on . Robin Williams plays Gabriel Noon , a storytelling night time deejay who is going through personal issues : his lover moves out and Gabriel is having what seems to be a case of storyteller 's block . One day he receives and reads a story written by a dying 14-year old boy named Pete Boland ( Rory Culkin ) . Pete tells the story of his life and the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents . He lives with his adopted mother and social worker , Donna Boland ( Toni Collette ) . Gabriel is fascinated and begins a friendship with Pete , but things seem strange when Gabriel attempts to meet him and discovers the possibility that Pete Boland may not even exist . I wo n't go into detail because I do n't want to spoil the film , but I will tell you this : it is quite predictable . Fascinating atmosphere for telling a story and good performances from Robin Williams and Toni Collette , who I thought was the film 's key character . Collette is without question one of the most talented and loveliest actresses . Her ability to tap into the psyche and personality of the characters she portrays is very uncanny and I hope to see her win an Oscar ( hell , I think she might pull off getting a Best Supporting Actress nod for this one if the script were a little better ) . The film starts off as a psychological thriller , but a predictable one at that . If your curious to know the film 's ending and twists , then see the film otherwise I would rent another predictable thriller called " Hide and Seek " .
pos	A convict serving time comes forward to give the Cold Case unit information about the murder of a policeman , committed years before . The murder of Sean Cooper , a good cop , was never solved . Naturally , the detectives believe the new evidence will help them put together all the pieces of the puzzle that frustrated their colleagues . In flashbacks we are taken to the baptism of James Bruno 's baby . Sean and Jimmy were partners . There is tension as Sean , who is the godfather , arrives disheveled and late for the rite . Eileen Bruno does n't appear to be happy being there . The real mystery is revealed by her . She caught Sean , who was drinking with Jimmy in the backyard , kiss her husband , and more shocking yet , Jimmy responding willingly . Somehow at the station the partners become the center of gossip . Sean has not endeared himself to his superior because he discovered the involvement with a criminal in his area who controlled the drug business . Sean realizes this man is in with the drug strong man because he always makes an excuse to free the scum bags Sean and Jimmy haul into the station all the time . The pressure is too much on Jimmy . Sean is comfortable in his homosexuality and wants to be honest about it . Cooper 's own father does n't want anything to do with a queer son . Even his superior McCree wants him out of his jurisdiction , but the case is complicated because Cooper comes from a long line of Irish men serving in the police force . Sean is killed because his homosexual condition , and for knowing too much on his peers ' involvement in taking dirty money . Tom Petit wrote this honest portrayal of the life of a police officer in the closet and his secret love with another fellow cop . We thought it was a frank account of a serious matter no one talked about in those days . Sometimes the people involved with the show , fearing reprisals from sponsors , or the networks , do n't dare to present these real situations . Jeannot Szwarc , shows a sensitive approach to this thorny issue , which is dealt without the sensationalism the case might have been shown with a different team . There is a rare Chad Everett appearance as the older Jimmy Bruno . His take is right on target with a touch of sentimentality that does n't get out of hand . Shane Johnson makes an excellent contribution to the show as Sean Cooper . The cast is marvelous and it includes good all around performances from everyone under Mr. Szwarc 's direction . In this episode , Nick Vera , gets closer to his neighbor , the mother of the basketball player the detective took his ball away . Nick is heading for romance with the woman !
neg	Umm .. I was quite surprised that someone actually gave this film high marks . Lets face it ... Tori Spelling is not a great actress .. and this movie just proves the extent of her " talent " . The movie 's plot was weak ... I bet the dork that came up with this concept was some perverted peeping tom . If there is a good thing about this movie , I would say it 's that Tommy Chong 's daughter , just for the fact that she 's his daughter ... and then there is that Soap - Opera - ish male lead who 's decent good looks somewhat make him attractive , but ceases to help his dramatic abilities . * Why does IMDb require at least 10 lines ? How many more ways can you simply say " This movie sucks " ?
pos	Ida Lupino was one of the few women to break through the directorial glass ceiling in Hollywood under the studio system . Not surprisingly , she also tackled proto - feminist themes that , when touched at all , were approached in so gingerly a manner that it was seldom quite clear what was being talked about . In Outrage , she treats rape and its aftermath , and though throughout the short movie it 's referred to as ` criminal assault , ' she leaves , for once , no doubt about what happened . Mala Powers ( in her official debut ) plays a secretary - bookkeeper at a big industrial plant ; she lives with her parents but is engaged to a swell guy ( Robert Clarke ) , who just got a raise and now makes $ 90 a week . Leaving the plant after working late one night , she finds herself being stalked . In the ensuing scene  the best in the movie  she tries to escape her pursuer in a forbidding maze of buildings and alleys but fails . When she returns home , disheveled and in shock , the police ca n't get much out of her ; she claims she never saw her attacker ( who manned a snack truck outside the factory ) . Trying to pretend that nothing happened , she returns to her job but falls apart , thinking that everybody is staring at her , judging her . She goes into a fugue state , running away to Los Angeles on a bus but stumbling off at a rest stop .   Waking up in a strange ranch house , she learns that she 's been rescued by Tod Andrews , a young minister in a California agricultural town . She lies about her identity and takes a job packing oranges . The two fall vaguely in love , but it 's clear to Andrews that Powers is keeping dire secrets . When , at a company picnic , she seizes a wrench and cracks the skull of Jerry Paris , who was trying to steal a kiss , the truth about her past comes out .... It was a courageous movie to come out in 1950 , and that may explain and excuse some of its shortcomings . Lupino never recaptures the verve of the early assault scene , and the movie wanders off into the bucolic and sentimental , ending up talky and didactic . Yes , Lupino had important information to impart , but she did n't trust the narrative to speak for itself . Her cast , pleasant but bland and generic , were n't much help , either , reverting to melodramatic postures or homespun reassurance . But Outrage was a breakthrough , blazing a trail for later discourse on what the crime of rape really is , and what it really means to its victims .
neg	  I did n't see They Call Me Trinity , but this sequel is really unfunny at all . It has many gags that are supposed to make people laugh . I guess the filmmaker just do n't have the talent to do it right . Wonder why it was so popular in the 70s .
pos	An enjoyable Batman animated film . Not on par with " Return of the Joker " or " Mask of the Phantasm " , but solid nonetheless . I liked how the movie kept you guessing as to who Batwoman was . There was nice twist . Nice action sequences . I 've always been of the opinion that the Batman cartoons are better then any of the pitiful Batman live action film sequels . The trend continues here . 7.5 out of 10
neg	Near the closing stages of Baby Mama , one of the central characters goes on to describe the basic outline of everything that came before and summarises that it ' was all just a mess ' ; I really could n't say it any better than that . And while the feature does have its odd ray of hope every now and again , the vast majority of what is present is too neutered to be considered relevant and too unremarkable to be worth anyone 's time . A lacklustre cast , mundane script and vague , caricature characters ensure that Baby Mama certainly is n't taxing on the ol' noggin , but it never makes up for this through its proposed sense of humour . Consisting mainly of very routine , cliché jokes based around an odd couple ( rich and poor ) trying to live with each other as they prepare to bring a baby into the world , the film is far too esoteric to deliver laughs outside its very thin demographic . As a story on finding love , it 's not that bad , but playing this plot line as a side - story of sorts to work alongside the comedy - orientated odd couple tangent , characterisation is notably weak , resulting in a lukewarm romance that never bubbles . As characters themselves , both central figures are mildly amusing when put together in small spaces , but when left alone quickly unravel and bare their emptiness ; so while we may eventually come to find the character 's interactions with each other amusing at times , the comedy never branches beyond distant chuckles ; we do n't feel for the characters and do n't find them inherently interesting , but rather their dynamic . Unfortunately however , although this dynamic works best , or at least better than the individual personas , as mentioned above , it rarely stems outside of the typical confines of the odd - couple formula . Kate ( Tina Fey ) is a successful business woman who has hired working class , dumb - blonde Angie ( Amy Poehler ) to be her unlikely surrogate , and after Angie decides to leave hopeless husband Carl ( Dax Shepard ) , both eventually have to learn to live together despite their obvious differences . Yes , it 's the typical odd - couple premise , and one that we have already seen in this year 's What Happens in Vegas , yet what Baby Mama lacks that the aforementioned movie had is both chemistry between performers and semi - layered characters . Kate and Angie both fail to ever show much of a personality outside of their two dimensional outline and as such both performers are neglected to play out roles that demand chemistry to produce out of thin air . In fact , the movie 's only real engaging performance and character comes from the underused talents of Romany Malco who gets lumbered with playing a door - man . Of the few times that I laughed during Baby Mama , most of those moments were because of this man , and the remainder usually fell to Shepard . It 's a rare thing of course to find a movie which embodies its script 's themes in the way which its world is shot and presented to us through the camera , and yet director Michael McCullers goes from page to screen effectively enough . Yet , for a film about babies , multi - million dollar business and cultural stereotyping , this is n't necessarily a good thing . Baby Mama is grade - A , hammy , plastic tinsel - town with capital bore topped with sugar . So not only did I feel emotionally distant to the characters because of their two - dimensional nature , but I simply did n't care for the world they inhabited . The dialogue , along with sets , costumes , and the script 's general themes are painted in pastel blues and pinks so much that all shades of humanity are lost in the director 's incessant need to make his movie feel like a neutered fantasy ; these are n't characters and that is n't our world in any way   so why should I care ? At the end of the day however , a romantic comedy 's ultimate gauge of success or failure comes down purely to its chemistry between its love interests , and the frequency of its laughs ; Baby Mama has little going on in any of these departments . Of course to say that the film is without any value at all would be unfair . I 'm sure female audiences in a similar boat as lead character Kate may get a slight kick out of the proceedings , but anyone else will probably just feel numb and probably bored . In this respect Baby Mama avoids being unbearable , but never convinces in being anything remarkable or worthy of a look to anyone outside of its immediate audience ; a comedic dud and a romantic mismatch , Baby Mama is too light - headed to be interesting and too shallow to be entertaining . - A review by Jamie Robert Ward ( http://www.invocus.net )
pos	I saw this movie in 1969 when it was first released at the Cameo Theater on South Beach , now the famous Crowbar Night - club . It was the last year of the wild 60s and this movie really hit home . It 's got everything ; the generation gap , the sexual revolution , the quest for success , and the conflict between following one 's family " traditions " to those of seeking ones own way through life . It was a fast paced , highly enjoyable movie . Vegas was at it 's hippiest peak , Sin City in all it 's glory . Beautiful women , famous cameos , laughs , conflict , romance , and even a happy ending . A very enjoyable time over all .   The poster from this film rests on my bedroom wall . I look at it and I go back in time ; a time of my youth and my times with my dad , a great time in my life .
neg	" Witchery " might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80 's but , luckily enough , it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects , an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices . Honestly the screenplay does n't make one iota of sense , but who cares when Linda Blair ( with an exploded hairstyle ) portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and David Hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer ( who ca n't seem to get laid ) in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo , sewn - shut lips , upside down crucifixions , vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune . Eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts . The young couple is there to investigate the place 's dark history ; the dysfunctional family ( with a pregnant Linda Blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are ) considers re - opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex . They 're forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady  an aging actress or something who always dresses in black  starts taking them out in various engrossing ways . Everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window . Anyway , the plot is definitely of minor importance in an Italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin - off of " The Evil Dead " . The atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make - up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film . There 's something supremely morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenseless woman hanging upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried .
pos	Now I love American Pie 1 and 2 while 3 was great just for Seann William Scott 's performance as Stifler but after that the quality has dropped . Band Camp kept the standard reasonably high with characters you actually cared about but Naked Mile was the same joke and plot- lines recycled ( Erik Stifler 's sex problem is like Jim 's ) . It had some amusing moments like the Football game against the midgets and the ' punishment ' of Coozeman but on the whole it lacked originality and the ' Mile ' was just stupid and moronic . Not to mention the irritating girlfriend who does n't want to have sex .   Anyway enough about the Naked Mile . I watched Beta House with apprehension as I thought it could take the series to a new low but I was pleasantly surprised . To be honest there is no real plot but it 's filled with hot girls ( Ashley is incredible ) and sex jokes aplenty . Yes it is formulaic and the jokes are old but Dwight Stifler ( Steve Talley ) raises the bar with an exuberant performance . The Greek Olympiad is entertaining especially the penultimate and final events while Christopher McDonald 's cameo is hilarious . There are weak points though . Coozeman is as irritating as he was in the first , I 'm still baffled to as how he ever got a part .   While Coozeman is bad Erik Stifler is worse . John White made Naked Mile a pain to watch but in Beta House he takes his performance to a whole new low . First and foremost he lacks charisma , a Stifler prerequisite . You really ca n't care less about him . The only reason I was bothered about his relationship was so Ashley could be on screen ! She shines above him as does the rest of the cast . Seriously John White is the ultimate in bad acting and has about as much charisma as a dead fish .   Saying that the film does entertain and Coozeman 's fear that his girl is not exactly a girl is brilliantly funny .   Overall this film is worth renting , get a few of your mates in and have a laugh at the vomit - fest event and vent your anger at Erik ' loser ' Stifler .
neg	Robert Taylor definitely showed himself to be a fine dramatic actor in his role as a gun - slinging buffalo hunter in this 1956 western . It was one of the few times that Taylor would play a heavy in a film . Nonetheless , this picture was far from great as shortly after this , Taylor fled to television with the successful series The Detectives . Stuart Granger hid his British accent and turned in a formidable performance as Taylor 's partner .   Taylor is a bigot here and his hatred for the Indians really shows . Another very good performance here was by veteran actor Lloyd Nolan as an aged , drinking old - timer who joined in the hunt for buffalo as well . In his early scenes , Nolan was really doing an excellent take - off of Walter Huston in his Oscar - winning role in The Treasure of the Sierre Madre in 1948 . Note the appearance of Russ Tamblyn in the film . The following year Tamblyn and Nolan would join in the phenomenal Peyton Place . The writing in the film is stiff at best . By the film 's end , it 's the elements of nature that did Taylor in . How about the elements of the writing here ?
pos	TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY is possibly the best movie of all of Mary Pickford 's films . At two hours , it was quite long for a 1922 silent film yet continues to hold your interest some 80 years after it was filmed . Mary gives one of her finest performances at times the role seems like a " greatest hits " performance with bits of Mary the innocent , Mary the little devil , Mary the little mother , Mary the spitfire , Mary the romantic heroine , etc . characteristics that often were used throughout a single film in the past . The movie is surprisingly frank about one supporting character 's illegitimate child for 1922 and at one point our Little Mary is thought the unwed mother in question ! If the Academy Awards had been around in 1922 , no doubt the Best Actress Oscar for the year would have been Mary 's .
neg	Beyond a shadow of a doubt Mysterious Planet is one of the worst movies ever made , yet retains an affection in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and astoundingly awful sound track in the first 15 minutes ( and to be honest that 's all you need to see ) combine to create something that is hilariously side - splitting . The opening scene in ' space ' is just about as unfathomable as cinematography gets , as washing - up liquid bottles whiz past your eyes to muffled dialogue . Before you 've had time to work out whether it 's you who 's gone mad , the credits roll and the action struggles to life . And aside from the double - headed plasticine giant snail that terrorises our heroes , you also get the added double bonus of having both the original actors voices AND the dubbed voices at the same time . Pure genius . The sad thing for fans of this kind of fare is that I 've only ever seen one copy , so the chances of ever seeing it yourself is highly unlikely . Perhaps I own the only copy in existence .
pos	My boyfriend and I both enjoyed this film very much . The viewer is swept away from modern life into old Japan , while at the same time exposed to very current themes . The characters are realistic and detailed ; it has an unpredictable ending and story , which is very refreshing . The story is made up of mini - plots within the life of several geisha living together in a poor city district . I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a realistic romance or life in old Japan .
neg	This has got to go down as almost one of the worst movies of all time . Awful acting , awful script ... and they were the good points ! One to Definitely miss ! The jokes , if you could call them that , were so predictable as to be pathetic . Pamela Anderson is still relying on her body to detract from the fact that her acting is just as plastic ! I sat willing to give it a chance , hoping that it was going to improve which , alas , it did n't ! If it was a choice between this and a book , I suggest you settle down for a good read ! I like Denise Richards , which is why I gave this movie a go , but why she has let her self be cast in this movie is beyond me !
pos	Wow ! So much fun ! Probably a bit much for normal American kids , and really it 's a stretch to call this a kid 's film , this movie reminded me a quite a bit of Time Bandits - very Terry Gilliam all the way through . While the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward , Miike still throws in A LOT of surreal and Bunuel - esquire moments . The whole first act violently juxtaposes from scene to scene the normal family life of the main kid / hero , with the spirit world and the evil than is ensuing therein . And while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of Miike 's work , the layers of meaning and metaphor , particularly the anti - war / anti - revenge message of human folly , is pretty damn poignant . As manic and imaginatively fun as other great Miike films , only instead of over the top torture and gore , he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from Japanese folk - lore creatively conceived via CG and puppetry wrapped into an imaginative multi - faceted adventure . F'n rad , and one of Miike 's best !
neg	I was one of the few non - liberals who showed up to see Steve 's video . It was quite an experience ... in propaganda film - making and boredom . I was hoping the film might be an actual documentary of Michael Moore 's visit to my local school , UVSC , but it turned out to be another liberal , slash - and - burn effort to slam conservatives and the local religious community . It sure seems self - serving for a filmmaker to make a documentary that only reflects his preconceptions on issues . What 's more surprising is to see all the ' 10 ' votes his homeys have posted here . Did they even see the video ? Golly gee Batman , this must rank with All The President 's Men ! Their ratings are as obvious as the bias in this film .   Yeah , like stacking the votes at IMDb will help a lame movie . Maybe my vote will help balance this out .
pos	Claire Denis has demonstrated repeatedly that film does not need to tell a story , that it is sufficient to create an experience that allows the viewer to take the ingredients and make of them what they will . Ostensibly the idea within the framework of a most non - linear film is the older man living on the French - Swiss border , a man devoted to his dogs , who still has a lover , but whose cardiac status increasingly threatens his life . He has a son with a little family who infrequently meet with him , but when he discovers he is in need of a heart transplant he opts for going to Tahiti via Japan to obtain a heart transplant on the black market and to rekindle a long lost relationship with a son he had form a Tahitian women years ago . What Denis does with this outline of a story is use her camera to explore the loneliness of the soul , the vastness of nature , man 's interaction with people vs animals , etc . Much of the time the ' film ' does n't make sense , but that is because we try too hard to connect all the dots laid out before us in beautiful pictures . Life is sort of like that : we look , see , observe , integrate , process , and make of it what we will . In using this form of film making ( much as she did in the strangely beautiful ' Beau Travail ' ) Claire Denis has developed a signature technique . Whether or not the viewer finds the finished product rewarding has much to do with our individual methods of processing visual and conceptual information . This is an interesting and visually captivating film , but many viewers will find it an overly long discourse about very little . Perhaps watching again will change that . Grady Harp
neg	My wife and I just finished this movie and I came onto to IMDb to commiserate with the reviewers that found this movie less than satisfactory . However , of the 10 pages of reviews , only a handful are negative . I feel that this movie is a great concept gone horribly awry and I want to warn those who are looking to watch the movie into the future . I admit , I 'm more inspired to write reviews when I do n't like a movie than as to when I do , so my handful of reviews are all negative . Still , that does n't mean I 'm biased towards not enjoying a movie , but I often find more eloquent reviews of movies I do enjoy . Paris je t'aime is the most pretentious movie I 've seen in years . By using an " intelligent " concept and attaching some big talent to a couple of the WAY to many short stories , the movie ends up the worst of all worlds . It is art for arts sake , but something that a 2 year old could dream up and accomplish . Giving the director free reign of 5 minutes of screen time proves why there is a division of labor even in entertainment . Directors ca n't write , writers ca n't direct . ( I 'd like to throw in also that Clint Eastwood is overrated , but that is because he 's an actor turn director { which rarely works , either } ) . What ends up on the screen is a garbled mess of short stories that do n't make any sense , are not completed in 5 minutes and in total , spoil Paris to me . Why call it Paris je t'aime when a more apropos title is cluster f*ck ? There are only a couple stories that are watchable , most notably the piece by Alfonso Cuarón , but everything else will fall into obscurity . The Coen brothers short is passable , but can you name a movie of theirs that does not contain a scene with a pick guitar ? It 's as if all the directors decided on doing whatever it is they want to do and chose Paris as the place to do it . As we all love Paris , present company included , we are blinded by the fact that this movie SUCKS . In fact , I think they put the directors names on each of the shorts because directors saw how poor of a film this is and decided to make sure they were blamed only for their 5 minutes . Seriously . SERIOUSLY . People , Natalie Portman is NOT a good actress . She is is not a pixie dream girl waiting to be yours . And Maggie Gyllenhaal , why ? ! ? Are you people acting or just regurgitating performances from other movies ? I 'm looking at you Natalie Portman ( Garden State , Closer ) , Elijah Wood ( Sin City ) and Catalina Sandino Moreno ( Maria Full of Grace ) . One final comment on the acting : I give double kudos to Nick Nolte for acting and looking more humane than you have in ages or perhaps ever will again . Find his short on youtube as his 5 minutes are quite enjoyable . Writing short stories is very difficult and only a handful of authors have gotten it right . I 'm thinking of Ernst Hemingway , Raymond Carver , F. Scott Fitzgerald , and John Cheever , just to name a few . It is much harder than writing a full novel and only the truly talented can accomplish this . The same can be said about short films . It appears that only one director will live on in the annals of history . If you uphold Paris as a gem to be discovered and reflected through your own lenses with your own story , then do n't expect to enjoy this movie at all . The directors either did n't care or were lazy . In either scenario , by the time you are reading this it means you rented it . Praise be that you did n't pay 10 dollars a head in theaters for it .
pos	If you have any sort of appreciation for character and dialogue , and any sense of American cultural history , you will find a lot of very absorbing material in this film . It probably was originally a play , and that 's why it 's dialogue heavy , but I ca n't stress enough how these icons that we only have a shallow understand of are made into truly complex and wonderful characters . This film is better than any college course for telling you how to create a character - driven story .
neg	* Can anybody tell me WHERE is the COMEDY ? ? ! !   * ( Charlie Sheen ) is a very weak comedian , ( Thomas Haden Church ) is looking so feeble ( with him ! ) , and the whole thing is so thickheaded !   * They tried to make a live comic book which turned out to be super bloody comic nightmare and it was n't even funny ? Like the plan 's scene in the bathroom ; it was so good with its cinematic imagination but there is nothing more .. except PAIN !   * Donald Sutherland ? ? ! His relationship with his daughter ? ? ! * This is actually a kind of work which they made it just to made it and earn some money from it , but it became such a crime when THIS money would be robbed from the very us whom got deceived by so low art work and an entertainment had absolutely no entertainment AT ALL ! * Well , it would 've been uglier if it was big production and starring Brando in his golden years with a REAL star . * The Sheen 's family in here . Just be aware of that ! * Anyone who found themselves admiring this movie or -God Forbid- loving it ! Then you must go directly to therapy before you become more dangerous and hurt anybody else ! * ( Brando ) undoubtedly is a genius but the movie is n't ! And he was n't intending to be one in here after reading this for sure ! ! But the main big problem is that no one else ever worked in this thing trying , or wanting , to be a small time smart or even good ! ! ! ( Sorry I 'm crying now ! The movie 's torturing is unbelievable ! ) .   * There is a scene where ( Brando ) hitting ( Mira Sorvino ) by her shoes ! That was so realistic ! ? Maybe he was seeing himself in her so he was punishing himself for being in such a crap !   * For the milliard time : This one could 've been better ( or less worse ! ) . The script , till the train 's heist , was nice and I just imagined that they 'd escape to have some chase like it 's another ( Smokey and the Bandit ) but with ( Brando ) as the sheriff . In fact any of those chimeras was much merciful than what I 've watched ! * Why this masterpiece did n't receive any Razzie award ? ! You want to make me believe that there was lower movie than THIS ? I do not think so ! It 's a situation where the Razzie 's supervisor must himself win one for his negligence ! ! * Martin Sheen is here also as a guest star maybe for supporting his failure son but ironically the father was as failure as his son ! and why is that ? ! Well ! Because I hate Martin Sheen maybe more than I hate comic movies were n't as good as its ambition !   * It 's not a comedy movie , NO .. It 's a horror one ! , and I just hate horror movies especially those which have been propagandized as comic ones !   * Name good thing about it ? Hmmm ! Well , this one compared to another Marlon Brando 's monster movie ( The Island of Dr. Moreau - 1996 ) would be close to ( Casablanca ) ! !   P.S : if you still want to know what are or who are precisely the bad , the ugly and the very ugly in this movie .. Just pray your last prayers and go watch it .. May God Help You !
pos	John Waters has given us a genuinely enjoyable film . This certainly is n't without its shocking Waters - esque moments , but it is tamer than his older culty stuff , such as " Pink Flamingoes " . " Pecker " harkens back to John 's early mainstream stage in that it reminds the viewer of the same kind of humor that was evident in " Polyester " . Overall , a really fun comedy with some great moments !
neg	This movie is a waste of time and money . Throughout the entire hour and a half , I continued to wait for it to get better and it never did . It was slow moving , the plot jumped around , it was n't scary or interesting , and really never amounted to anything . The credits during the introduction were long and drawn out , which was basically like the rest of the movie ( long and drawn out ) . Numerous parts of the plot made no sense . Several times during the movie I had thought that maybe I had " zoned out " because the incongruity of the plot , however , my companion had the same issue and assured me I did not " zone out " from boredom , but it was indeed the movie . I 've actually never posted on here about a movie before and have been actively looking up movies on IMDb for numerous years . So the fact that I 'm actually taking the time to write something should speak volumes of how bad this movie is and that you should not waste your time or money on it .
pos	The Bourne Ultimatum ( 2007 ) Review : After a thrilling set of two , we get the final installment . Here 's my take : The Bourne Ultimatum has it all . We have Jason Bourne(Matt Damon ) on the coattails of the ones who know everything . He has been running for too long . This time , it ends . The Bourne Ultimatum has a great plot , awesome writing , fantastic direction , suspense , and some of the best action of the summer . Matt Damon delivers possibly his best performance to date . He has the conviction and swelling desire of the troubled assassin . There are some intelligent humor here and some fine suspense . The reactions to certain events will have you either laughing(in a good way ) or cheering on . ( or both ) I heard a lot of intelligent laughter in the theater and lots of clapping . The audience was loving it . The Bourne Ultimatum delivers all in a nicely gift - wrapped package . All of the goods and then some . This is , in my opinion the best movie this summer . The Last Word : Excellent conclusion . The best of the trilogy . This is how summer movie thrillers should be done . I love the Bourne trilogy .
neg	An innocent man ( Steve Guttenberg ) has a one - night stand with his boss 's wife ( Isabelle Huppert ) . She spots a woman ( Elizabeth McGovern ) being attacked outside but she ca n't call the cops because it would blow her marriage to Gutenberg 's boss ( Paul Shenar ) . So Guttenberg , honest citizen that he is , when he discovers that another woman was attacked and killed nearby only half an hour later , comes forward and claims to have witnessed the first attack , merely intending to pass on the information given to him by Huppert . Well -- never bear false witness against thy neighbor , as they say . This simple attempt to help the police nab a murderer turns rapidly twisted . When he meets the first near - victim , McGovern , she immediately twigs to what happened , but agrees to keep quiet for the moment . But then Guttenberg finds himself in court , supposed to identify the heavy ( Greenquist ) and we discover through cross - examination that he is NEAR - SIGHTED and ca n't identify objects at a distance , let alone faces . ( Not that it matters because , after all , he never saw the creep in the first place . ) The plot gets practically labyrinthine . Guttenberg winds up the chief suspect when Huppert is murdered too . He barely escapes arrest and holes up with the now - sympathetic McGovern . Guttenberg and McGovern hatch a plan to trap the murderer . She will serve as bait . They 'll follow the flagitious creep into one of his seedy haunt and McGovern will act like the doxy that the murderer is attracted to , just to get him to try to kill her . But everything will be okay , see , because not only will Guttenberg keep a close watch on her , and not only will he alert the police a few minutes after she enters this dive , but she will keep a can of mace handy -- just in case . I ask you , the alert viewer , does this scenario unfold as planned ? Elizabeth McGovern has a quirkily interesting bone structure . She seems all mandible and tiny mouth at times , but she 's vibrant . Steve Guttenberg has hair on his brawn and that 's about it . Otherwise he 's as helpless as the character he plays . If Isabelle Huppert can act , it is n't evident in this film . The killer is so formed and so groomed that he looks like he 's wearing one of those masks of deformity in that Twilight Zone episode about greedy heirs . Did n't the director , Curtis Hanson , go on to make " L.A. Confidential " ? That was a nicely done piece of work . Here , everything seems clumsy and contrived , down to the small bit parts . Just before the inevitable violent climax , a uniformed police officer is introduced to delay McGovern 's rescue , and the scene is embarrassing to watch . Dick Olsen has a bit part as a late shopper . He 's a neat guy and always reliable . Paul Shenar as the cuckolded hubby has a striking face that seems made for the stage and he does a fine job too . That louche joint where McGovern attracts the attention of the murderer , where she plays pool with a couple of hairy apes , was shot at a bar in Carolina Beach , in North Carolina , not far from where I lived . The way the interior is set up , it 's clear that this is supposed to be a dangerous and dirty dive . Actually it appears rather more elegant on screen than it did in reality . Overall , this is Hitchcock territory and it brings tears to the eyes to imagine what he would have done with this story .
pos	French production in which leading film directors from 11 countries were invited to create 11-minute short films conveying their reflections on the events of September 11 . The film segments vary widely in content and quality . Two allude to U.S. complicity in terrorist acts ( in Chile against Allende , who died on September 11 , 1973 , depicted in the segment by British director Ken Loach ; and in Palestine by U.S .- backed Israelis , shown in the segment from Egyptian director Youssef Chahine ) . Two more recall other destructive acts ( a Palestinian suicide bombing in Tel Aviv , shot by Israeli director Amos Gitan ; the Japanese " holy war " against the west in WW II , by Shohei Imamura ) . Ironies abound in several stories . Shadows that darken the New York City apartment of a grieving old man suddenly disappear as the World Trade towers telescope to the ground in Sean Penn 's piece , bringing the man momentary joy . But in this bright light he can finally see that his wife is really gone . In Mira Nair 's film , based on a real incident , a missing young man , also in New York City , the son of a Pakistani family , is first presumed to be a fugitive terrorist , but later he proves to a hero who sacrificed himself trying to save others in the towers . There are poignant moments dotted throughout . Loach has his exiled Chilean man quote St. Augustine , to the effect that hope is built of anger and courage : anger at the way things are , courage to change them . Imamura tells us that there is no such thing as a holy war . Samira Makhmalbaf shows a teacher with her very young Afghan schoolchildren , exiled in Iran , trying to tell them about the events that have just transpired in New York . But they are understandably more impressed with a major event in their refugee camp , where two men have fallen into a deep well , one killed , the other sustaining a broken leg . This is comprehensible tragedy on a grand scale for the 6 year olds .   Idrissa Ouedraogo , from Burkina Faso , creates a drama in which the son of an ailing woman spots Osama bin Laden in their village and gathers his buddies to help capture the fugitive terrorist , in order to get the $ 25 million U. S. reward . He tells his friends not to let any of the adults know their plans , for the older folks would merely waste the money on cars and cigarettes , while he plans to help his mother and others who are sick and destitute . It is Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu ( maker of " Amores Perros " ) who provides by far the most powerful and chilling segment , one that , for the most part , shows only a darkened screen with audio tape loops of chanting and voices and occasional thudding sounds . Brief visual flashes gradually permit us to see bodies falling from the high floors of the towers , and it dawns on us that the thuds are these bodies hitting the ground . The sequence ends with elegiac orchestral music and a still shot , bearing a phrase first shown only in Arabic , then with a translation added : " Does God 's light guide us or blind us ? " ( In various languages with English subtitles ) Grade : 8/10 ( B+ ) . ( Seen on 10/31/04 ) . If you 'd like to read more of my reviews , send me a message for directions to my websites .
neg	Dialogue : stilted , clichéd ; Acting : hammy , clichéd ; Plot : predictable , clichéd . Just what are Christopher Plummer Nastassia Kinski doing in this " B " rubbish ? Plummer was well established decades before this movie was made , Kinski had masterpieces like " Tess " and " Cat People " behind her ... Must have been desperate . The bad guys all have bad - guy accents - * bad * bad - guy accents ! ( Plummer especially ! Where * did * he learn to do " German " ? ) and most of them have bad - guy sneers as well . The innocent bystanders all overdo their panicking enough to make you laugh . The good guy survives , amongst other things : * a 5 " throwing knife buried hilt - deep in his shoulder - just pulls it out and seconds later is using the arm with no difficulty at all ; * marines ' machine - gun fire ( I think someone referred to a .50 ) in the leg which he sorts out by tying a bandage around his pants leg and thereafter he barely has a limp ; * several fist - fights in which he sustains multiple punches to the face as well as being run cranium - first into a door frame ; * a fall , backwards , from what looks like the third floor , onto paving , without the slightest sign of a twisted ankle or any other such trifling inconvenience . The script has exactly 3 clever lines , the rest of the time it 's all so dull and boring . OK it 's not all bad . Plummer does bring a certain class to his part , and is undoubtedly the best actor in this flick . Of course that does n't say much , but he can do the callous villain without resorting to the ham techniques most of the villains use here . He delivers his " Ve haff vays and meance " type lines with some menace , but you are always aware you are watching Christopher Plummer acting the villain . This movie is truly an awful waste of time . The acting , such as it is , is sort of 70 's 007 movies wooden line delivery meets Bruce Lee 's very obviously faked fight scenes , but it 's not even anywhere near as good as either a Roger Moore 007 or a Bruce Lee film . Do n't bother .
pos	My Super Ex Girlfriend turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me , I was really expecting a horrible movie that would probably be stupid and predictable , and you know what ? It was ! But this movie did have so many wonderful laughs and a fun plot that anyone could get a kick out of . I know that this was a very cheesy movie , but Uma and Anna were just so cool and Steve was such a great addition along with a great cast that looked like they had so much fun and that 's what made the movie really work . Jenny Johnson(scary , that 's my best friend 's actual name ) is not your typical average librarian looking woman , when Matt , your average male , asks her out , he 's in for more than he expected , he 's asked G - Girl out on a date , the super hero of the world ! But when he finds out what a jealous and crazy girl she really is and decides that it may be a good idea that they spend some time apart , but Jenny wo n't have it since he 's fallen for another girl , Hannah , and she will make his life a living hell , I mean , let 's face it , he could n't have chosen a better girl to break up with . The effect were corny , but you seriously move past them quickly , the story and cast made the story really work and I loved Uma in this movie , it was such a step up from Prime . My Super Ex Girlfriend is a fun movie that you should n't really take seriously , it 's just a cute romantic comedy that I think if I could get a laugh out of it , anyone could . 7/10
neg	" Gone With The Wind " is one of the most overrated movies in history . It is a film loved by mothers , grandmothers , and shut - ins who go to the movies once every five years . As a zombie movie , it blows . There is n't a shambling corpse in sight , and it 's terribly light in the gore department . " Zombie 3 " , on the other hand , is big on shambling corpses and quite generous with its blood - spilling -- therefore , it is better than " Gone With the Wind " . It is also not overrated . Most reviewers are under no delusions that it is rubbish . It is , however , not boring rubbish . After a terrorist steals a virus , he drops it while being pursued by a helicopter , and the chemicals leak into the ground . The terrorist , who has been exposed to the nasty concoction , hides in a hotel room where he slowly morphs into a flesh - eating zombie . One of his first victim 's is a cleaning lady . Once she 's bitten , Lucio Fulci 's brand of hell breaks loose . As usual for a Fulci flick , the acting is atrocious , the storyline is riddled with plot holes , and the gore is plentiful . Turns out the film was directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei , so that explains its rather schizophrenic nature . It is badly shot , too , poorly edited , and the sound design is flat . Still , it is saved by its gleeful adherence to the goriest of murders and its impatient pacing . Definitely worth picking up if you 're an undead completest . Or do n't like " Gone With The Wind " , undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time .
pos	The pros of this film are the astonishing fighting scenes - absolutely incredible sword - moves and martial art show off . A true John Woo masterpiece . The story tends to be a bit week though , but it never overshadows the overwhelming display of acrobatic martial art action . If you are into martial art movies , you are going to LOVE this one !
neg	My wife and I just finished watching Bûsu AKA The Booth . She fell asleep during some parts of the movie . I really wish I had taken a snooze with her , but the unfortunate fact is that the main character 's voice is so loud and grating that it was impossible for me to sleep . When our protagonist speaks , it makes me want to hear Regis Philbin and William Shatner sing karaoke . He also has no redeeming qualities . I was hoping he 'd get hit by a bus five minutes into the film . Do n't get me wrong , I love Asian horror cinema , but The Booth is extremely irritating and full of scenes that really make no damned sense at all . If you want some good Asian cinema , check out A Tale of Two Sisters or Into The Mirror . Avoid The Booth like the plague , especially if you suffer from frequent migraines .
pos	This was directed by Ruggero Deodato , a true icon to many horror film fans after he directed the seminal and notorious Cannibal Holocaust . However , do n't expect to find any such notoriety in the film reviewed here as it proves to be incredibly tame in comparison and plays more like a Conan inspired outing for a young audience . Such a description may instantly put off most fans of the whole Conan inspired Sword & Sorcery genre but before you turn your nose up at this , it has to be said , this movie is just so much fun ! It 's mostly played for laughs and features two HUGE and highly likable heroes in the form of David and Peter Paul aka . the Barbarian Brothers who both seem to be having a ball with their characters . B - Movie favourite Richard Lynch turns up as the main villain in the piece and it 's also great to see roles for Big George Eastman and Michael Berryman . Added to this , the ladies are stunning to behold and suitably scantily attired throughout the films duration ( a staple and much welcomed ingredient in the genre ! ) What can I say , - this simply is a really fun and lighthearted take on the genre and I recommend it wholeheartedly !
neg	Tom Wolfe 's sprawling , brilliantly observed satiric novel of life among New York snobbery gets a glossy look here but is nevertheless not well served . The film suffers not merely from the miscasting of everyman Tom Hanks as an uncaring Yuppie , Kewpie - doll Melanie Griffith as a manipulative southern belle and Bruce Willis ( ? ! ) as the darling of New York 's literati . The most serious miscasting was in the director 's chair . Robert Altman might have breathed life into these unlikeable characters and made them interesting , but Brian De Palma , for all of his visual sophistication , has never had an eye for the nuances of the human experience . The resulting film looks good but seems blah toward its subject of dehumanization in favor of status . Honestly , if a satire does not make the viewer angry , what is the point ?
pos	I had the privilege of watching " Holly " at the Edinburgh Film Festival last week . What a powerful and moving story ! Holly is a 12 yr old Vietnamese girl who is sold into prostitution by her own family and living in a brothel in Cambodia . Patrick ( an American ) comes into Holly 's life and decides he wants to help her . When Holly is sold again , Patrick desperately searches for her . We follow they 're difficult journey through Cambodia and hope for their reunion . Holly is one of millions of children who are sold and trafficked every day . The movie portrays this difficult issue without crossing the line . I walked away wanting to know more about the issue of child trafficking and asking how can I help ? This movie should be seen by everyone because it is a beautiful story and it exposes an issue that we should no longer ignore .
neg	Seriously , there is absolutely NOTHING good about this crap fest at all . Randolph Scott , a closet homosexual who lived with his lover Cary Grant for twelve years , is at his most wooden and boring in the least role . At 57 he was clearly far too old for these romantic roles , although it does n't matter so much here because Gail Russell looks so much older than her 31 years and she is so ugly due to her chronic alcoholism and chain smoking . Lee Marvin plays his usual villainous role but it is n't enough to save this garbage . Thank God they do n't make westerns any more , they 're just dated , racist old movies that glamorise guns and murder . 0/10 .
pos	I recently watched this , but when it started I had no idea what the concept was about , what the topic was ..... in short - I had no idea what it was . Was it a documentary , was it a comedy routine ..... Well , it was BOTH . It started a little slow , but I think that 's because I had absolutely no idea what type of program I was viewing . But it quickly sucked me in . The episode I watched had Robert Wuhl discussing fact and fiction in history . Mainly how we ( american 's ) learn history that is n't really true - and how we got to learn what we did . He did this in such a way as to keep the viewer completely entertained , and interested . I actually learned a few things and that is a true indicator of how effective this type of program can be . I would love to see this picked up as a series for HBO . I believe it can be just as fun and effective with a variety of topics - especially if they are " taught " in the same type of manner as this episode .
neg	" Dominique " is one of those films that the expression " slow - as - molasses " must have been invented for . Too many endless and repetitive sequences ( how many times do we see Robertson walking down the stairs slowly because he can hear someone playing the piano ? ) . It is ALMOST redeemed at the end by a surprising twist , which , unfortunately , is followed by a second twist that succeeds only in leaving a bad taste in our mouths . Not a very enjoyable film .
pos	Excellent plot within a plot within a plot . Shame about two of my film heroes having a good snog . Must be my upbringing : ) Very well acted by all . You never quite know who 's going to out - do who . The last little twist at the end allows for all to get their just deserts . Recommend to all . A harmless , tongue in cheek thriller which if it has any faults is probably Michael Caine 's over - use of the word " bloody " , but that 's his signature , is n't it . 9/10
neg	Was it foreshadowing when Tori complained that her first boyfriend was treating her like a robot , and then her new boyfriend ( the murderer ) turned out to be a designer of artificial intelligence ? I think so . Scenes to make you squeal with delight : montages galore , a strip - tease in a kimono ( what do you call it when you seductively put clothes on , instead of take them off ? ) , and a climactic battle on skis ! Definitely tune in for the beginning and end , but you can grab a sandwich during the second act when all the plot is happening . Is it better than CO - ED CALL GIRL ? Nah . Does Tori ever make it to paradise , or out of the snow , even ? Nope .
pos	_ Les Acteurs _ is the absurd story of Jean - Pierre Marielle desperately waiting for a cup of hot water , the story of a conspiracy against actors , the story of aging actors whose careers are slowly less active than they used to be , but a stunning tribute to French actors and their cinema . Supported by a solid reflection about cinema and acting ( the fourth wall , the hidden cameras , to play or not to play ) , the story of this film in which most of those famous actors play their own role ( not to be mixed up with living their life in front of the camera - the film is not voyeur ) is quite vague , and follows the actors in series of episodes which make the film quite amusing . As André Dussolier quits the film and leaves Josiane Balasko to play his part ( great actress , she 's hilariously serious especially when , in Dussolier 's role , she bitches about herself ) , as actors run in each other on the street , asking for autographs , as fights and gossip happen , we recognize pastiche of other scenes in which each ( or others ) have played . Actually , for whoever does not know the actors ( most of them being at least in their 50s ) or does not know French Cinema , this movie has less interest , since most of the references will be missed , but it will still offer a good track of reflection on aging , on acting , on public life ...
neg	It seems the makers of this film had trouble deciding what their message really was . Consequently , they had even more trouble delivering it . They began by poorly describing principles of quantum physics which relate to sub - atomic particles . Having established a fuzzy picture of Heisenberg 's Uncertainty Principle , they presented a barrage of talking heads who built a case of ridiculous logic intimating that every living person is an entity which follows the same quantum rules on a cosmic scale . Then there was a lot of talk about ideas upon which Stephen Covey and Tony Robbins have made their careers : positive thinking , interrupting bad patterns , always look on the bright side , etc . Next came a bit about how our brains can change our bodies through production of proteins : hormones which we more or less choose to create . If you are sad , you will create sad proteins . If you are happy , you will create happy proteins . It 's just so simple , is n't it ? Interwoven with our lessons we follow the fictitious life of Amanda , a photographer who pops anti - depressants and hates her thighs . The film makers slowly but surely were trying to get us all to say , " Hey , Amanda , just cheer up ! " Why ca n't she cheer up ? Obviously it 's because the world is a BAD place where there is crime and poverty and religion , that 's why . The conclusion of the film ( which is basically the entire second half ) brought on a barrage of contradiction . We are all a part of a whole energy where we are not beings , but a collective consciousness , but we are individuals who can change the world , but there are many of each of us because of all the different dimensions , but we can choose who we are , and we have a purpose to do good , but there is no god because there is nothing better than us , so there is no such thing as right and wrong , so there is no such thing as reward or punishment , so nothing good ever came out of religion , but we should still do good anyway , even though there is no such thing as bad and good because there is nobody to decide what that is , except for the fact that we each can make life good if we all meditate , and then crime will cease , and if we say nice things , our water will freeze into pretty shapes . Still with me ? Good because there is more . According to Robert L. Park in his book " Voodoo Science " , the whole meditation experiment put on by John Hagelin in Washington , D.C. was a farce , the numbers were doctored , and the murder rate was higher that year that any year before or since . And what about your positive attitude keeping you young and healthy ? This was a message delivered by an older man who looked his age and a woman who was overweight . So does all this work or not ? I was lucky enough to see the film at a theater where Betsy Chasse , one of the film 's three directors ( yes , three ) fielded questions following the show . I call myself lucky because I had first - hand confirmation that these people do n't know what they are talking about . Several of the questions asked by audience members had her so stumped that her husband , a chiropractor , had to step in and recite the answer . I finally had to leave when the discussion inevitably turned political , and everyone , including Ms. Chasse , began speculating as to how wonderful the world would be if only President Bush could see this movie .
pos	I saw the movie before I read the Michelle Magorian book and I enjoyed both . The movie , more than the book , made me come close to tears on several occasions . This film touches the deepest points of the human soul and never lets go . I encourage as many people to watch this masterpiece as much and as soon as possible . I give it ten stars .
neg	" Sleepwalkers " is the first film which Stephen King has written a script for . Given this , and the excellent Santo & Johnny song that they used as the theme of the movie , you would be expecting a odd , and ultimately fulfilling viewing experience . Unfortunately , that 's not what you 'd be getting . The thing is , they could have probably made it a good movie . The beginning is intriguing what with it 's small town spooky atmosphere . But something strange happens about 20 minutes into the film . The film turns funny for no apparent reason ! From that moment on the whole atmosphere of " Sleepwalkers " is ruined . For those of you who have seen it , who can ever forget good old Johnny screaming out " COP KABOB ! ! " after jabbing the pencil into that one cop 's ear ? ! ? But do n't get me wrong , the humor has no redeemiing quality . I just rented it again to see if mabye I was wrong the first time around , given how original the plot sounded , but I was right . Man , what a waste . I ca n't believe they got the rights to that Santo & Johnny song . I gave this a 2 .
pos	Erich Rohmer 's " L'Anglaise et le duc " makes a perfect companion piece to Peter Watkins ' " La Commune ( Paris 1871 ) . " Both films -screened at this year 's Toronto International Film Festival- ironically illustrate how history is shaped to by the tellers of the tale . Ironic , given the tragic events that were taking place in the U.S. during the festival . Set in Paris during the French Revolution , the movie , based on Grace Elliott 's ( Lucy Russell ) " Memoirs , " is a first - hand account of how she survived those heady but dangerous days . She also details her relationship with The Duke of Orleans ( played by Jean - Claude Dreyfus ) , who , in contrast to herself , is a supporter of the Revolution . True to form , you do n't know whose side of history Rohmer is going to come down on . One of the earliest of the French " New Wave " filmmakers , Rohmer has often been criticized for being too conservative . After all , in the midst of the rebelling - youth - Viet - Nam days of the late 60s and 70s , he was filming romantic little confections like " Claire 's Knee . " But do n't sell the old boy short , folks , he 's always been a student of human nature , not an ideologue , and " L'Anglaise et le duc " continues to bear this out . Rohmer 's characters are never the " bad guys " nor the " good guys ' ; they are first and foremost human beings who are capable of exhibiting a full range of human potentialities -and limitations . That 's why his movies are always provocative , and this film is no exception . Now for the technological nuts and bolts . Rohmer , though making his way into his 80s , is still on the cutting - edge of cinematic innovation . The look of " L'Anglaise " is like something you 've never seen before . You guessed it , the old guy -like several of the festival 's directors this year- has gone digital . All of the movie 's exterior scenes look as though they are taking place in their original 1780s Parisian settings . As a matter of fact , you may get so distracted from marveling at the authenticity of the film 's look you may have to go back for a second screening to catch the subtleties of the film 's psychological -and yes , I 'll say it- political insights . Toronto features some of the world 's edgiest young filmmakers this year , as well as some of the world 's oldest . And the old masters are standing there on cinema 's cutting - edges right alongside the young ones . Long live youth . Long live old age . And long live Erich Rohmer .
neg	Mt little sister and I are self - proclaimed horror movie buffs . We have seen just about EVERYTHING , especially zombie flicks . Now , we have seen a lot of good zombie movies , and a lot of bad ones . This BY FAR is the WORST movie I have ever seen in my entire life . Not only was the acting horrible , but the special effects , graphics and ever " zombie " make - up was the worst I have seen . If you can even call it make - up ( black eye shadow around the eyes ) This is totally proof that you should never judge a book by it 's cover . Cause the cover to the movie is the only sweet thing about . do your selves a favor and DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I was so adamant about this movie I went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before i returned it to movie saying " This movie sucks , do n't waste your time , return NOW " hahahhaa I do n't want anyone else to waste a good movie night on this POS movie ! i do n't even know how it got the ratings that it did , t should be in the negative
pos	As winter approaches , our state - owned broadcaster , the ABC , has decided for some reason to have a partial Jane Austen Festival on Sunday nights . This commenced with a twelve - year old movie length version of " Emma " last Sunday ; more recent versions of three other novels , " Persuasion " , " Northanger Abbey " and " Mansfield Park " are to come . The curious thing about this production by A&E Television Networks , with script by the ever - reliable Andrew Davies , is that it appeared almost simultaneously with two much bigger budget movie versions , one starring Gwyneth Paltrow , and " Clueless " , a " modernized " version , starring Alicia Silverstone , which transported the plot to Beverly Hills . Perhaps as a result , even with Kate Beckinsale in the lead , this production sank without trace . As a general rule , much is lost when novels are shrunk to fit feature movie length . The adaptations one tends to both enjoy and remember are those which have adequate room to develop both story and characters . An outstanding example is " Brideshead Revisited " which had 13 50-minute episodes back in 1982 . You only have to compare the very ordinary movie - length version of " Pride and Prejudice " in 2005 with the brilliant 1995 six - part TV mini - series . It 's not that a novel should be filmed page by page , and some novels ( often not very good ones ) adapt wonderfully to film ( " Atonement " is a recent example ) , but novels of the Jane Austen sort need some time and space to exert their full charm . Given the shortcomings of this type of adaptation , this production is OK . Kate Beckinsale gives Emma the right mix of self - assuredness and vulnerability and Mark Strong is a forthright Mr Knightly ( he reminded me that Jane tended to recycle characters  Knightly is a more articulate version of the moody Mr Darcy of P&P ) . Samantha Morton was a rather limp Harriet but Prunella Scales got the blabbermouth Miss Bates perfectly  Sybil Fawlty on speed . Bernard Hepton as Emma 's feeble father was also excellent . We saw the damp countryside , the mud and the poverty as well as the posh interiors , in case anyone thought this was a particularly idyllic age for everybody . Even though this was a condensed adaptation it was oddly slow in places  some of the conversations were rather stilted , even allowing for the formalities of the times . I 'd have to look at the film again to be sure , but it might be due to the under - use of reaction shots . If you do like filmed period stuff this is a perfectly nice example , and compares well with the Paltrow version . Anyway , there is more to come !
neg	One of the silliest movies of the 1940s , an unbearable haunted house comedy with music starring Kay Kyser . Kyer , orchestra leader and radio - star ( and eternal college fraternity goof - off ) , was sort of the precursor to Spike Jones , hamming it up for his guests and backed up willingly by his merry troupe of musicians . He 's hired to play a birthday party in a gloomy mansion , the kind where poison darts imported from Africa are framed and hung on the wall . The shindig is beset with a creepy judge , a scary professor , an ominous swami , lots of giggly females , and enough bad jokes to fill three Bob Hope pictures . The songs ( by Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer ) are nothing to brag out , and neither is over - confident Kyser , yukking it up with elbow - in - the - ribs material that turns 1940 back ten years . * from * * * *
pos	" CASOMAI " was the last movie I 've seen before getting married , just last year .   It was also the first movie I 've searched for , after I was married , because we promised to offer a copy to our priest . Sometimes , reality is not that apart from fiction . To all those who wrote that priests like " Don Camillo " do n't exist in real life , I would recommend them to visit my Priest Pe . Nuno Westwood , in Estoril , Portugal :-) To all others , I would only recommend them to see this movie , before and after the " I do ! " day :-) Rodrigo Ribeiro Portugal
neg	Perhaps being a former Moscovite myself and having an elastic sense of humor prevents me from tossing this movie into the ' arthouse / festival crap ' trashcan . It 's not the greatest film of 2005 , nor is it complete garbage . It just has a lot of problems . I also sincerely doubt this movie was banned due to any ' ideological fears ' , or ' conservative taboos ' or any other reason this movie might conversely be called ' courageous ' and ' uncompromising ' abroad . It was banned because the censors knew 99 % of the Russian film - goers would find it offensive because of the bad taste exercised during the shooting and editing of this otherwise dull film . So we have a strong opening shot . Wonderful sound design , excellent premise - laden with meaning and symbolism . The usage and placement of symbols will consistently be of the film 's strongest aspects ( not that the number 4 is a daunting visual challenge ) . Over the next 40 minutes we have an equally strong setup . An amusing and well - written bar conversation among the 3 ( main ? ) characters , and we feel pathos for these people , the great country of Russia , the human condition and all that . Then the movie starts slowing down . We begin to wonder what -yawn- lies ahead . The rest is quite boring , simply put . Sure , the guy in the village tugs the heartstrings , and there are some slightly amusing moments . Nice sound , sure . But the enjoyment of this movie , not to mention the plot , are seriously compromised by the pacing problems . And this , this lack of a payoff for sitting through all the ( nicely - shot ) abject misery and bleakness , is what ultimately will make people angry at the ' offensive ' stuff ( personally , the main offensive scene bordered on being endearing , in that pathetic way harmless drunks can appear ) . If you want to watch an enjoyable movie where Russians get wasted for prolonged periods of time ( the entire film ) , watch Particulars of the National Hunt . Much more rewarding post - Soviet stuff . So yeah , a 4 out of 10 for 4 , nice and symbolic of my post - mediocre - film condition .
pos	Thanks Jymn Magon , for creating Disney 's 2 best cartoons ever . This show has improved very much over the years . As a kid , I did n't like it because I thought it was a rip - off of Ducktales , which was my favorite Disney thing at the time ( like Grandmoffromero ) . Then later on though it was good but not great . But after reading the reviews here , I decided to give it another chance & bought the DVD set & watched the whole pilot the first day I got it , & was very pleasantly surprised . It 's still my favorite episode , although the series did live up to it . And by the end of disc 1 , I knew this was going to be a top tenner . The characters are so complex & charming . My favorite has got to be Wildcat . He 's absolutely hilarious and sweet to boot . My next favorite is Baloo , the best pilot on the show . I can see why ' ol Jymn built the show around him . Then it 's Kit Cloudkicker . He & Baloo have the best relationship in the series . After that , Louie . Jim Cummings did a perfect job of impersonating the original voice . After him , Rebecca . She has made me laugh pretty hard , and I do believe she and Baloo eventually marry . And finally(for the heroes ) , Molly . Although she 's my least favorite , I still like her . I think she 's a very cute character(much better than Webby from Ducktales ) . And the villains were very original . Don Karnage & his air pirates always crack me up , Kahn is ice - cold and ruthless , and the Thembrians are always at least amusing . As said before , the stories range from hilarious(Time Waits For No Bear , Romance of Red Chimp ) to nothing short of touching(The Old Man & the Seaduck , Paradise Lost ) , to fun , funny & exciting adventures(In Search of Ancient Blunders & my favorite For Whom the Bell Klangs ) . These are only a few of my favorite episodes . Anyway , Talespin is Disney 's best , aside from Gummi Bears Some reasons for this ? GB had a decent amount of my favorite character(Cubbi ) , while TS did n't have enough of Wildcat . But in the end Talespin remains a classic . BOTTOM LINE- 10/10 6th best cartoon ever .
neg	This is a very cheaply made werewolf flick . The video is dark and poorly lit . The audio is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed . The script is cliche ridden junk with the usual characters like the tough detective who shoots werewolves with his silver handgun ! [ filled of course with silver bullets ] . The acting is as wooden as the characters . The FX are non - existent , lots of extreme close - ups of werewolf jaws and biting . the only thing that is shown is lots of soft - core T&A. Instead of dropping $ 30 for this tripe check out a really great recent werewolf pic : " Dog Soldiers " with Sean Pertwee .
pos	I remember this series so well . It was excellent - such strong and compelling characters , stylish and sexy ... and so different to everything else on offer at the time - and now ... I am sure that it inspired the also excellent Canadian drama " Traders " .   Both season 1 and season 2 are available on DVD region 2 in the UK . Its a treat to watch the series again . Season 1 is 13 episodes and season 2 seems to be 10 episodes . Unfortunately , it seems to have ended after 2 seasons . This series was a lot of fun . Sometimes you can get it on special at Amazon.co.uk
neg	( Only minor spoilers except as noted ) . I 've enjoyed a lot of Spanish cinema recently ; both the actual Spanish cinema of people like Almodovar , and the Latin American cinema of directors like del Toro , whose superb " Devil 's Backbone " , set in Civil War Spain , was the finest horror film of the last decade . It 's no surprise , then , that this film is both well - made , well - acted , and manages to sustain that distinctively different Spanish atmosphere . But it 's also as nasty and pointless a film as one could hope not to have to see . What actually is the purpose of all this ? We have no real idea what caused the creepy central character to embark on his killing spree , despite the fact that large amounts of narrative voice - over are drawn directly from his own narcissistic journal . In a routinely unpleasant opening sequence , set more than a decade earlier , we see the central character killing his girlfriend in a rage of jealousy and control - freakery ( "  if I ca n't have you nobody can  . " ) . Oddly enough , that is perhaps one of the best sequences in the film , but it has no discernible relation to his subsequent killing spree , which appears completely different in both motivation and execution . What happened to him in jail to cause this change ? We have no idea , though we do later discover , as an absurd sort of afterthought , that he obtained a law degree while imprisoned . In Britain , in several of our notorious " serial killer " or " sex killer " cases , the terrible question arises ; what about the wife ? Did she know , or suspect what was going on ? This is a question that this film could have asked , and indeed the wife does begin to emerge as one of the more intriguing characters . But banally , the answer to the question is quite clearly : " No , she did n't " . Even when a dramatic opportunity like this is presented on a plate , the film still manages to bungle it . All we actually get , sketched perfunctorily out at the end , is her slightly amoral preparedness to cash in on the proceeds after the event . Compare this to the awful revelatory moment in Ten Rillington Place , where Christie 's wife says " you know what I mean  . " thereby sealing her own fate and allowing us an appalled glimpse into unimaginable chasms of suppressed knowledge and horror . ( Major spoiler in this paragraph ) . In the meantime , we are supposed to believe that the killer himself is a criminal mastermind who comprehensively outwits the police , thereby securing the briefest of incarcerations in a mental hospital before being released so that he can kill again . How exactly did he achieve this ? The plot gets extremely sketchy at this point ; something to do with deliberately leaving certain clues for the police ; but how this all works or why , or how the subsequent court case actually proceeds , remains a mystery . I actually do n't believe serial killers are like this . The Silence of the Lambs may be comic book stuff , but  Lecter aside  it gets its serial killers right . They are deeply disturbed , deeply dysfunctional , deeply inadequate people ; not the creepily charming mastermind presented here ( closely related to the equally implausible suave killer of The Last Horror Movie , or indeed even Man Bites Dog , though it appears not to have been noticed that that was a satire ) . This film has little suspense , and bungles what little intrigue the plot might have generated . It has nothing useful to say about the motivations of serial killers , either generally , or in the specific cultural milieu of Spain . This is nothing more than a poorly plotted excuse to show some pretty misogynistic violence to women . And oddly , what makes that violence even more repulsive is a certain prissy failure of nerve even in how it is presented . The soft core character of what is actually shown just makes it seem even more repellently titillatory . Just one explicit shot , properly timed , would have been infinitely more shocking , and would have rendered all the rest completely unnecessary , freeing up more film time to flesh out the gaping holes in plot and characterisation . Instead we just get endless shots of young women vulnerably spreadeagled on a table in their pretty but slightly revealing underwear . Very , very creepy . I 'm sorry to be rude ; I love horror films , and can tolerate even the most extreme , to the extent even of worrying my partner . But I think anyone who finds this film good , or interesting , even I 'd find myself edging away from . The purpose of a horror film is to scare you ; this is just lascivious . It leaves a very bad taste in the mouth indeed . I have to give this film more than one star just because it 's competently executed , but morally it deserves none at all and should never have been made .
pos	From what I 've read a lot of people were disappointed by this film , compared to Part 1 . Initially I could understand this but after a bit of thought I think they are wrong to be . Soderbergh continues his fact based telling of Che 's life that he started in Part 1 . Part 1 told a story of a revolution moving from unpromising beginnings to an ultimately successful conclusion . Part 2 tells a story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion . It is not Soderbergh 's fault that these 2 parts of Che 's life had completely different outcomes . He bravely chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way . The viewer may feel a lot better coming out of the cinema after Part 1 than Part 2 but that is the reality of Che 's life and not in my opinion any fault of the director . The film is far from perfect . It is probably too long . At least in Part 1 we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had successes . In Part 2 they ca n't catch a break and we see their numbers constantly being reduced by death and capture . Che 's capture and death are dealt with well . The film is greatly enhanced by the dialogue being in Spanish . Benicio Del Toro is again excellent as the charismatic Argentinian . So if you 've seen Part 1 you will see a very similar telling of a very different story in Part 2 .
neg	This TV film tells the story of extrovert Frannie suddenly returning to Silk Hope to visit friends and family , but unaware of her mother 's death . Her sister runs the family home , but is intending to sell it and move away with her new husband . Frannie strongly objects to the idea , and vows to keep the family heirloom as it were , by getting a job and maintaining responsibility . In comes handsome Ruben and the two soon fall in love ( as you do ) , and it 's from this point that I sort of lost interest .... There is more to Farrah Fawcett than just the blonde hair and looks , she can portray a character extremely convincingly when she puts her mind to it - and it is certainly proved here as well as some of her previous efforts like Extremities and Small Sacrificies - a great performance from the legendary Charlie 's Angel . Silk Hope is the type of film that never shies away from its cheap and cheerful TV image , and you know there was a limit to the budget , but it 's not the worst film ever made . The positive aspects are there ; you just have to find them .
pos	Petter Mattei 's " Love in the Time of Money " is a visually stunning film to watch . Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations . This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money , power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter .   This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler 's play about the same theme , the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect . Each one is connected in one way , or another to the next person , but no one seems to know the previous point of contact . Stylishly , the film has a sophisticated luxurious look . We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat . The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits . A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment , as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter . The acting is good under Mr. Mattei 's direction . Steve Buscemi , Rosario Dawson , Carol Kane , Michael Imperioli , Adrian Grenier , and the rest of the talented cast , make these characters come alive . We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work .
neg	There is no artistic value in this movie to deserve any award . Well , it does not deserve an audience as well . Ironically , one of the awards is for cinematography but frankly , the camera movements are disconcerting to say the least . Every frame , you feel you are getting the " full picture " , its like someone is " cropping your view " from the edges . The story is pathetic . Well , I will be honest , I could not bear to watch the entire movie . The part that sucked the most was when I saw the soldiers partying in their barracks and one of the soldiers coaxed to drink liquor . These and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of Steven Seagal . Take my advice , stay away from this piece of crap .
pos	I used to write comments at IMDb , but I do n't do so anymore . It happens that IMDb has become massive , and consequently subjectiveness has ruined scores . What do I mean ? That anyone that is not particularly fond of movies and does n't have any expertise on the subject , watches some crap ( or the opposite ) , and in case he likes it , delivers a 10 , and if he does n't he goes for a 1 . This of course , can not measure anything correctly . Now for the film . I truly regret ever having delivered any 10s to some very few films , because then I must score this one with 12 or 13 , which is not possible . This documentary has something that I do n't expect to watch ever again in my whole life in any other film . It is simply mesmerizing , and it 's not just a way of saying ; it really is . The last 25 minutes have a load of energy , visual rejoice and wisdom -the words spoken by the starring guys- , that really ... there 's no possible match . I do n't keep movies , rarely would I find any sense in doing so , but this one is the kind of film you should buy and keep , and watch from time to time , maybe 10 or 20 times as years go by . I got nothing more to say . This is a genuine , objective 10 for me .
neg	The Oscar season has arrived so this means a slew of these deep , engaging , powerhouse ensemble films are all over the movie theaters in hopes of gaining an audience and having the opportunity to earn Best Picture in the big show . Among them is this film that is based off a very popular and well - acclaimed play . The original playwright was actually the writer and director of the film adaptation ; which comes as a double - edged sword . On one hand , who better to translate the play than the original writer ? On the other hand , who better to not see the mistakes and drawbacks of the play and fix upon them than the original writer himself ? Doubt mixes excellent acting and plenty of tension and suspense ; with a frustrating ending , unnecessary dialogue , questionable directing , and of course , the inability to provide substantial answers . It is a growing trend among these " high - caliber " films to not answer all questions it provides , and this has to stop . Doubt is like a joke without its punch line , like a book with the final 20 pages missing , like losing reception while watching the fourth quarter of a hotly contested football game , and like not having the 50 cents to continue playing the arcade game and see what happens next . Doubt , just like the previous Best Picture frustrationfest No Country For Old Men , does n't really end ; it does n't provide us with considerable answers nor does it deliver enough for us to figure out the ending . Yes , that was the intent , but this is n't a test of humanity , it 's a cop - out . I do not pay money to see an unfinished work , I pay money to see a beginning , middle , and end , and pray that I do n't fall asleep during the three acts . We are forced to become the " writers " of the movie by filling in the blank ourselves as to what happened before and what will happen to the characters we saw screaming at each other . This little drama is about a nun ( Meryl Streep ) who seems very sure that the well - beloved priest ( Philip Seymour Hoffman ) is making sexual advances towards a child that goes to the church ; the first African - American boy in the Catholic church . The church is secretly torn as to whether or not he really is committing heinous sins behind everyone 's backs . The plot thickens as some of the kids begin behaving differently , which attracts the notice of a young teacher ( Amy Adams ) . The story is set right after the assassination of John F. Kennedy , which shook the nation for quite some time and questioned their faith in humanity and in each other . Doubt 's strong points come in the acting ensemble and also the ever - engaging suspense that builds slowly and never boils over . Streep seems to be Oscar - worthy in every role she 's in , and here she is no different as her sternness and cold - hearted behavior places a blanket of fear in all the students and with some of the staff in the church . Hoffman excels yet again as the priest , by successfully meshing suspicion with a charming personality and a friendly aura . The seemingly hypocritical personality is tough to pull off , especially when we are suppose to like him and also ponder about him at the same time ; but Hoffman steps up to the plate against one of the best actresses of our generation and fantastically delivers . When these two argue , you can hear the fireworks fly without ever seeing one launched . But let 's not forget Amy Adams ( Enchanted ) and Viola Davis ( Law ad Order ) for their superb job either . Doubt 's casting ensemble is among the best in 2008 . Yet , like previously stated it 's the writing and directing that ruins this film , especially when dwindling down the third act . Questions pop up , but they are n't answered . Characters pop up , but provide no real enhancement towards the plot . Kids behave different , but we never truly find out why . There are awkward angles in the camera - work  and  there 's no actual reason why . John Patrick Shanley , the writer of the play , had one previous film in his directing repertoire : Joe Versus the Volcano . Whether sheer arrogance or stupidity , we are stuck with seeing overdrawn sequences of random conversation , utter annoying chatter that bores to no end ( There was a two minute discussion about coffee and how much sugar the priest wanted ) thanks to Mr. Shanley . Bottom Line : The lack of an ending is a stupid trend that 's just as irritating as the seizureific camera - work in action films . It does n't matter that we have a great talented acting cast , or decent cinematography , or a good story being worked upon , or good usage of sound and music ; because we have a barrage of unanswered questions that sprinkles all over a film that is over 100 minutes yet does n't even finish ! The translation from play to film is good and quite accurate , because we have the original madmen behind the projectbut he took the mistakes and stupid hiccups from the play to the film as well . This decade has seen its share of blockbuster and high - profile films that could have gotten a much higher score from me if they had just decided to add a few more minutes of footage and actually end : Sideways , Cast Away , No Country For Old Men , Burn After Reading are a few examples . Newsflash : end your stinkin ' movie . Please or at least provide a good amount of clues for us to easily fill in the blank ( like Wall - E 's depressing backstories ) , instead of staring into space as the credits suddenly start rolling and you are left with a feeling of emptiness , confusion , and mental anguish . Have a beginning , middle , and the end please ! ! As a critic , I prefer my films to be whole , not incomplete . Doubt feels incomplete , which is why it gets an incompetent grade . Someone has to break this stupid trend .
pos	Most folks might say that if one were to spend a Saturday night watching a movie , you must be really bored . Actually , I had just gotten back home from being out and turned on the TV and there it was,"Paulie " .   I had missed the opening credits , so I did n't know the name of it but I saw that it had Cheech Marin in it , so I naturally thought I had tuned into " Born In East L.A. " When I saw him talking to a talking parrot , I was ready to dismiss this as the kind of flop movie they show late in the night . Happy to say , it was better than that . As you know , if you do n't already Paulie is lost and trying to get back to his original owner . Seems it 's taken years to find her . What should be Paulie 's advantage is actually a dis - advantage in ways . People come across a literate parrot and all they see is a way to make money or benefit themselves .   While Cheech Marin 's character " is " making money from him , he 's not mean to him . The dance sequences with the parrots are something kids will find cute , I found them amusing . Paulie , who 's naive',learns quickly that not all humans are nice people . Especially the owner of an animal research lab . The man lies to him saying he 'll help him find his owner as long as he helps in his animal communications research . Paulie is now stuck but decides to make a fool out of the man at a demonstration to others of Paulie 's vocal ability . Throughout the film Paulie 's telling his story to the facilities janitor who ends up freeing him , several other animals and finding the location of Paulie 's owner . It 's a touching reunion .   8 out of 10,the wing clipping scene should have been assumed and not shown . That part might bother younger children . Otherwise , it 's a great movie for older kids and adults who are a kid at heart . ( END )
neg	If there was a 0 stars rating i would gladly hand it out to this absolutely horrid pile of waste . The fact that the actual summary is perfectly fine and that if it had been made different it could have been brilliant only makes it worse . The basic task of locking up a group of people in an experiment chamber is fine , but WHERES THE EXPERIMENT ? All i see is a bunch of unintelligent surfers and blondes chatting about music and culture i do n't know or want to know about ... The challenges are pathetic and silly . The whole point of reality TV is to show REALITY . If you set a ' challenge ' do n't make them play with exaggerated props of food and stereotypical cultural elements in ' friday night games ' . make them do an actual challenge . And as for ' earning ' prize money , that s fine , if they actually earnt it ! These people are nuts . If only they would make the show better , the actual idea would be glorious . But that ai n't gon na happen !
pos	LE GRAND VOYAGE is a gentle miracle of a film , a work made more profound because of its understated script by writer / director Ismaël Ferroukhi who allows the natural scenery of this ' road trip ' story and the sophisticated acting of the stars Nicolas Cazalé and Mohamed Majd to carry the emotional impact of the film . Ferroukhi 's vision is very capably enhanced by the cinematography of Katell Djian ( a sensitive mixture of travelogue vistas of horizons and tightly photographed duets between characters ) and the musical score by Fowzi Guerdjou who manages to maintain some beautiful themes throughout the film while paying homage to the many local musical variations from the numerous countries the film surveys .   Reda ( Nicolas Cazalé ) lives with his Muslim family in Southern France , a young student with a Western girlfriend who does not seem to be following the religious direction of his heritage . His elderly father ( Mohamed Majd ) has decided his time has come to make his Hadj to Mecca , and being unable to drive , requests the reluctant Reda to forsake his personal needs to drive him to his ultimate religious obligation . The two set out in a fragile automobile to travel through France , into Italy , and on through Bulgaria , Croatia , Slovenia , and Turkey to Saudi Arabia . Along the trip Reda pleads with his father to visit some of the interesting sights , but his father remains focused on the purpose of the journey and Reda is irritably left to struggle with his father 's demands . On their pilgrimage they encounter an old woman ( Ghina Ognianova ) who attaches herself to the two men and must eventually be deserted by Reda , a Turkish man Mustapha ( Jacky Nercessian ) who promises to guide the father / son duo but instead brings about a schism by getting Reda drunk in a bar and disappearing , and countless border patrol guards and custom agents who delay their progress for various reasons . Tensions between father and son mount : Reda can not understand the importance of this pilgrimage so fraught with trials and mishaps , and the father can not comprehend Reda 's insensitivity to the father 's religious beliefs and needs . At last they reach Mecca where they are surrounded by hoards of pilgrims from all around the world and the sensation of trip 's significance is overwhelming to Reda . The manner in which the story comes to a close is touching and rich with meaning . It has taken a religious pilgrimage to restore the gap between youth and old age , between son and father , and between defiance and acceptance of religious values .   The visual impact of this film is extraordinary - all the more so because it feels as though the camera just ' happens ' to catch the beauty of the many stopping points along the way without the need to enhance them with special effects . Nicolas Cazalé is a superb actor ( be sure to see his most recent and currently showing film ' The Grocer 's Son ' ) and it is his carefully nuanced role that brings the magic to this film . Another fine film from The Film Movement , this is a tender story brilliantly told . Highly recommended .   Grady Harp
neg	I stopped watching lost at this episode because I thought Ana - Lucia and Libby 's deaths were unnecessary and really depressing . Then I found out that they kept Libby around just to die in the next episode ! Gah ! I ca n't handle it . I liked this show for the first season , but it definitely declined in the second season , I found Jack and Locke 's little religious feud to be annoying . The deaths of Rodriguez & Watros ' characters was the final straw !   I give this episode a 4/10 , for being the end to my viewing of this formerly great series created by Alias legend J.J. Abrams . I hope his series in the future will improve on this one .
pos	This is the best Emma in existence in my opinion . Having seen the other version ( 1996 ) which is also good , and read the book , I think I can safely say with confidence that this is the true interpretation and is the most faithful to Jane Austen 's masterpiece . The 1996 movie with G. Paltrow is good too , it 's just that it 's almost like a different story altogether . It 's very light and fluffy , you do n't see the darker edges of the characters and if you just want a pleasant movie , that one would do fine but the intricacies of some of the plot points , such as the Churchill / Fairfax entanglement is so much glossed over as to be virtually non - existent . But if you want the characters fleshed out a bit , more real and multidimensional , the 1996 TV version is the superior . Emma is a remarkable person , but she is flawed . Kate Beckinsale is masterful at showing the little quirks of the character . You see her look casually disgusted at some of the more simple conversation of Harriet Smith , yet she shows no remorse for having ruined Harriet 's proposal until that action has the effect of ruining her own marital happiness at the ending . You see her narcissism and it mirrors Frank Churchill 's in that they would do harm to others to achieve their own aims . For Emma , it was playing matchmaker and having a new friend to while away the time with after having suffered the loss of her governess to marriage . For Frank Churchill , it is securing the promise of the woman he loves while treating her and others abominably to keep the secret . In the book , she realizes all of this in a crushing awakening to all the blunders she has made . Both Kate Beckinsale and Gyneth Paltrow are convincing in their remorse but Paltrow 's is more childlike and stagnant while Beckinsale 's awakening is rather real and serious and you see the transition from child - like , selfish behavior to kind and thoughtful adult . Both versions are very good but I prefer this one .
neg	Muscular man - ape in the jungles of Africa is hunted by an opportunistic expedition team ; the comely daughter of the team 's leader finds him first . Much - ballyhooed version of the Tarzan tale has an OK production , but is crippled by the single - handedly worst direction of a film I have ever seen . John Derek is bereft of inspiration beyond cheesy slow - motion action shots and peek - a - boo glimpses of wife Bo Derek 's unclothed body ; he has about as much talent behind the camera as Ed Wood . Trying for tongue - in - cheek sexuality , the Dereks lack finesse , snappy timing , and taste . They have a sense of self - parody and bravura abandonment ( they do throw caution to the winds ) , but after a promising opening it all goes to hell . Miles O'Keeffe ( who possibly had marbles in his mouth the entire time ) has the title role , but plays third fiddle to John Derek 's ego and Bo Derek 's sense of self - importance . * from * * * *
pos	Watching Before The Devil counts as one of my all time best experiences at the cinema . I have been intrigued my the mixed response to the film - and for me , the extremes of opinion indicate the film touched on something either embraced or disavowed by the general audience . It is one of those films that has stayed with me , and I continue to ponder and think about it . Surely the DVD would illuminate some more of the themes and the film - making elements ? Which include : Sidney Lumet 's comeback movie , the time - shifting technique deployed in the storytelling , the superb combination of Lumet and Masterson and why it works so well , the masterly direction , the relatively rare focus Hollywood movies give to male characters and their largely doomed struggle to become an open cheque book for their women , the under - presented , but nevertheless resonant Marisa Tomei 's performance , and , of course , the superb Hoffman with that central monologue about the sum of his parts - for me the heart of the movie . Phew ! Surely a masterful film . So imagine my disappointment watching the eagerly anticipated DVD - only to find no commentary , no behind - the - scenes , no interviews , no extras . Hey - distributors - sort it out !
neg	Uwe Boll has done the impossible : create a game adaptation that stays at least somewhat true to the game ; he has turned a game full of antisocial and offensive content into a movie full of antisocial and offensive content . So , as an adaptation , it 's a success . Unfortunately , it 's still Uwe Boll we are dealing with here , so do n't expect the movie to be actually any good . while it does have it 's moment , " Postal " wears out his welcome very fast and becomes a pain to sit through . At its core , Postal is a satire on the United States , as done by a twelve year old kid . Boll seems to think that offensiveness is linearly proportional to comedic value : the more offensive , the funnier , and the more exaggerated the funnier . This results in a movie that sets new levels of tastelessness while being extremely hit and miss . Yes , some gags do work but it seems to be pure luck . High points include the director satirizing himself , and people getting hit very violently by trucks and other vehicles . Low points include .. well pretty much everything else . After the initial surprise wears off , Postal simply becomes a bore to watch . Yes there is a good joke every and good point ten minutes , but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters shooting and chasing each other all over the place for what seems to be an eternity . This probably would have worked as a short movie , but it 's just not enough content for something that lasts over 90 minutes ( although it feels twice as long ) . There are nice ideas and nice tries , but they get hopelessly lost in endless and pointless action scenes and content that is offensive just for the sake of it 4/10
pos	It seems Hal Hartley 's films are kind of hit or miss with most audiences . This film will be no exception to that rule . Fay Grim acts as a sequel to Hartley 's ' Henry Foole ' from 1998 . The focus this time is on Henry 's ex wife ( played to perfection by the always welcome Parker Posey ) , who is being pestered by CIA goons about Henry 's unpublished book about all of his shady dealings . In the interim of all of this , Fay ends up on an odyssey , dealing with international spies , etc . The film does get a bit bogged down in the second half . If you 've been a fan of Hal Hartley in the past , this is one not to be missed . For the novice Hartley first timer who has only heard of his film making technique , you might want to check out his earlier films before taking on this one ( especially if you have n't seen ' Henry ' yet ) . I admired the camera work , which at times reminded me of certain early Man Ray photography .
neg	when you get to the scenes that involve Albert Brooks without his shirt ... try not to gag on a fur ball . I like Albert Brooks . I 've seen most , if not all of his movies but it was the first time seeing this one . Modern Romance is an interesting take on the subject of love . There are few movies that handle the desperation of love as well or as overtly as Modern Romance , although 1979 's Chilly Scenes of Winter comes very close . They both essentially deal with obsessed men that are too psychologically attracted / obsessed to their respective women . Where - as Chilly Scenes of Winter borders on the subject stalking , this movie has a more grounded foundation with the subject of love because both people are already in a relationship .. and out of the relationship .. and back in it again . And because it 's a movie that was released in 1981 , it is of its time in terms of styles and such . That 's the main reason I like this movie . My basic rule when it comes to movies is " If it sucks at least it may have some historic relevance " , you know time capsule stuff . Which leads me to the horrific scenes of Albert Brooks sans shirt . The man is hair . Very hair . Like he 's wearing a black curly fur sweater - hairy . And what 's worse is he almost looks burn victim - hairy . It 's not a pleasant sight and the scenes with him without a shirt go on and on . Back in the early 80 's hairy men were seen as normal and nothing shocking . But in 2009 the sight of something like this is just plain revolting . Sorry , Albert ! I wish at some point someone said " hey let 's try this scene but with you wearing a simple t - shirt , I mean you might scare people " . It 's just really bad and I feel sorry for the poor pretty actress that had to deal with Albert Brooks naked body on top of hers . She was probably pulling out his hairs from her teeth for days after that . Anyway , it 's an OK movie . It could have been better if I had n't see Albert Brooks without his shirt for what seemed like 10 long continuous minutes because that will forever taint my viewing of this movie .
pos	JACKNIFE is a fine adaptation of Stephen Metcalfe 's play ' Strange Snow ' ( the screenplay was also written by Metcalfe ) , sensitively directed by David Hugh Jones , that explores the too frequently forgotten effect of battle on veterans damaged permanently by the heinous cruelties of war . It is especially poignant to return to this 1989 film now as we watch the soldiers returning from the war in Iraq and the raw treatment they are receiving in our Veterans ' Hospitals . Three friends went off to the Vietnam War together and only two returned alive : the problem is that while both men suffered in battle the one David ' Highschool ' Flannigan ( Ed Harris ) is so severely damaged by posttraumatic stress syndrome that he ' exists ' in a drunken vacuum with his very plain schoolteacher sister Martha ( Kathy Baker ) . As David deteriorates his buddy Joseph ' Jacknife ' Megessey ( Robert De Niro ) returns to the town in an attempt to help his friend . In the course of events Jacknife at first offers succor to Martha and eventually the two date - at a Prom Martha must attend - and at that prom drunken David completely falls apart , destroying relics in the school and terrifying the townspeople and students . Jacknife makes Dave relive the moment in Vietnam when they lost their buddy and in doing so brings David to the point where he can begin his climb toward recovery . And the long - suffering Martha finds her needs tended by Jacknife , too . All three actors give astonishingly fine performances : Ed Harris offers one of his most fully realized roles while De Niro and Baker maintain the high standards set by their careers . More people should help resurrect this all but forgotten film as it is a brittle reminder of the damages our wars bring to the men who fight them and to the families who receive them after battle 's end . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
neg	OK . Not bad movie making if it were from an original script . BUT IT IS NOT ! Which part of " in this story there are no women , except for Foulata and Gagoola " introduction by Haggard did the producers , directors and writers not understand ? I mean , it is pretty plain English . I understood it at age 10!. The beauty of KSM is that it contains a spectacular description of three different worlds , the colonial Africa , the unforgiving desert and Kukuanaland , a hidden and isolated kingdom . That should be more than enough for even the most mediocre of producers to work with . But , nooo , they have to throw " romance " into it . Pathetic . Suggestion to all you poor souls who actually thought this would be close to the book . Give it up . Until a Peter Jackson wannabe comes along and " does it right " you may as well keep re - reading the tome . BTW , there is a sequel book ( actually a pre - quel ) called Allan 's wife . It gives background to the story of Quatermain . It is a bit creepy but good .
pos	I liked this movie,,cute and funny . I found this film to be a good family film.the dirtiest part of this movie was when it made references to the New York Yankees . You have to be in Red Sox nation to understand that NY Yankees is a dirty word . Sorry to say that to the Yankee 's fans . I recommend this picture for the entire family . Of course with your typical love / comedy movie,,there 's a long moment in the movie,,with i 'm in love and what do I do,,but the movie makes up for that with all the slapstick moments . The movie show 's some moments of how the Red Sox nation ( in Fenway Park)how the fans felt about 86 years of the Sox always screwed up at the end of the season and how the love of the Sox and the love with another human go hand to hand .
neg	Within the first few minutes of this Dutch thriller , we learn that Krabbe is a gay alcoholic writer who sleeps sans underwear , fantasizes about murdering his roommate , tries to steal a magazine from a news stand , and lusts after a studly young man he meets at the train station . And he 's the hero of this nonsensical movie that is all dressed up ( except for Krabbe in at least one scene too many ) but has nowhere to go . The basic plot is very simple but is dragged out to nearly two hours before reaching a pointless conclusion . Verhoeven has a nice visual flair but resorts to scenes of wild hallucinations , overt symbolism , and gratuitous gore when he runs out of ideas .
pos	Fans of the HBO series " Tales From the Crypt " are going to love this MOH episode . Those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic EC comics were based on , will recognize this one right off the bat . Underrated indie favorite Martin Donovan ( also an excellent writer - co - author of the screenplays for APARTMENT ZERO and DEATH BECOMES HER ) is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way . He could play a really nice if misunderstood guy - next - door , or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness . In the case of RIGHT TO DIE , he takes the latter approach , and it definitely works . Donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist ( Robin Sydney ) , much to the displeasure of his inconsolable , unforgiving spouse , Abbey ( Julia Anderson ) . When the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of " making up , " and she 's horribly burned in a fire , he 's reluctant to pull the plug on her , not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy ( Corbin Bernsen , looking the worse for wear these days . )   But Abbey 's never been one to give up without a fight , and that 's where the EC - theme of the episode comes in . Cuckolded husbands - and wives - have always been the genre 's favorite subject matter for some spooky ( and OOKY ) supernatural shenanigans , and this case is definitely no exception . If anything , the ramped - up quotient of sex and gore must have Bill Gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere . And that 's not to mention that John Esposito 's original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist . You do n't realize as you 're watching that you only know half the story , until close to the end ... (think WHAT LIES BENEATH with more guts and gazongas , and you 're there . ) Not a bad effort , but not the best of the lot , either . At least Rob Schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction , especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed ! As with most MOH episodes , this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment , so the extremely squeamish need not apply .
neg	" Attack of the Killer Tomatoes " consists mostly of rambling , poorly assembled footage in search of a movie . The plot makes no sense , and the various characters drop in and out of the picture with no explanation at all . Watching this silly spoof , you get the feeling than so many other comments have captured so accurately : that it 's easy to make a cheap , low - quality film and then use the " parody " angle as an excuse for its cheapness and low quality ( in one scene , female swimmers are terrified of tomatoes that are floating near them ; how far can " suspension of disbelief " go - even in a parody ? ) . The title song is great , though . ( * 1/2 )
pos	Vivah is by no means a classic . However in the days of hardcore action , path - breaking special effects & complex plots ( none of which Bollywood has mastered yet ) , its quite refreshing to see a simple film like Vivah . The story as we all know is a journey from a couple 's first meeting to their eventual wedding after some coy moments and testing times . Nothing more , nothing less . The music is n't quite in the same league as MPK or HAHK but does n't jar your senses either . Two songs stood out for me - Mujhe Haq Hai & Do Anjaane . While Milan abhi aadha & Hamaari shaadi were hummable . Shahid performs sincerely & shows a lot of potential . Its good to see him play something else but the " cool dude " he normally does . Amrita is very sweet and plays the role of a docile small - town girl to perfection . Alok Nath , Anupam Kher & Seema Biswas are terrific supports and the rest of the cast does a reasonable job . Suraj 's direction is simple but effective . The movie 's prime flaw is the slow pace which might test the patience of a lot of young viewers . But all in all a good , clean , decent family movie .
neg	PLAN B has the appearance of a quickly made , unedited , sloppy script for a movie with the attempt for an outing for the actors involved - an outing that should have been nixed from the start . It is just another Mafia - based ' comedy ' that has nothing new and lowers the standard for those participating . Joe Maloni ( Paul Sorvino ) is the crime boss more concerned about clothing and appearances than about his business of control . His personal assistant Mario ( Anthony DeSando ) is dumber than dirt and his ignorance is supposed to be funny . Maloni has whacked one of his debtors ( who just happens to be married to bookish Fran - Diane Keaton ) and Maloni takes Fran on as his assistant to work off her dead husband 's debt by being Maloni 's ' hit man ' . Fran is afraid of her own shadow and is unable to carry out Maloni 's assignments , electing instead to transport her ' whackees ' to Florida to hide at her brother James ' house until she can figure out what to do next . This alternative to killing the three candidates is called Plan B , Plan A being to kill them ! The ending is wholly predictable just as is every line assigned in the script to the characters . Diane Keaton has made a lot of fine films and is one of our most talented actresses and comediennes , but here she screams and rants and twitches her way through a ridiculous part that quickly becomes annoying to watch . Paul Sorvino is , well , the Paul Sorvino type cast from other mobster films . The supporting cast is likewise allowed to play to the balcony in the broadest slapstick , pratfall fashion imaginable . What is supposed to be a comedy ends up being just silly and overdone . Director Greg Yaitanes needs to go back to TV sitcoms : had this flimsy story been compressed into a half - hour gig it might have had a chance . Grady Harp
pos	The Menagerie parts one and two was the only 2-parter during the 3-year run of the original Trek series and it was because Roddenberry was able to insert most of the footage from the 1st pilot " The Cage . " The move was made out of necessity , to combat deadline problems in getting episodes produced ( such a sf show back in the 1960s was a hassle to get done on time ) . One positive outcome back then was that audiences , unaware of the pilot produced almost a couple of years earlier , were treated to a whole new crew and captain for these two episodes on top of the regular cast of characters , as if the producers had spent double the money on these episodes to present a TV epic spanning a dozen years of Starfleet history ( though they still used terms such as ' United Space Fleet ' in these early episodes ) . The wraparound story begins as a space mystery plot : the Enterprise is diverted to Starbase 11 for unknown reasons and very soon Spock is a suspect in these shenanigans . Astonishingly , though even McCoy belabors the fact that Spock 's Vulcan heritage makes subterfuge on his part impossible , it does turn out that Spock is indeed acting out some mutinous scheme to shanghai our precious starship and kidnap his former captain , Pike , now horribly crippled . Well , Spock is half human , we tend to forget . Or has he simply gone mad ? It may very well be , for he 's directing Enterprise to Talos IV , a planet so off - limits it 's the subject of the only known death penalty on Starfleet 's books . When the jig is up , there 's a great scene of Spock surrendering to a flabbergasted McCoy , as Uhura looks on in shock . Even Kirk , usually steady as a captain should be , does n't know what to make of his first officer 's illogical conduct . In the 3rd and final acts , we begin to see transmitted images of a mission of the Enterprise from 13 years prior , when Capt . Pike was commanding and Spock was one of his officers . We really do n't know where all this is going and what Spock hopes to accomplish - and that 's another thing that makes this a very good 2-parter - we really need to find out what it 's all about in the 2nd part . Not only is Spock facing severe penalties , but it looks like Kirk 's career may be finished , as well . Double jeopardy , folks . This is also the 1st televised episode to feature one of those shuttlecrafts ( none were available in the earlier " The Enemy Within " when the crafts were really needed ) . There 's also one of those neat matte paintings to convey the ambiance of a futuristic starbase - this was the only way to visualize such things back then . Finally , check out Kirk 's smug approach at the start of the episode - boy , do things go sideways on him as the story progresses .
neg	Two days after seeing this thing , I 'm still in agony over HAVING seen it . It 's so bad , you have to wonder how anyone could write this tripe , much less allow it to be loose on the general public . Stilted acting , a leading man who looks like he 's sleepwalking , and Alison Eastwood embarrassing herself . The action is indicative of low budget movie making , which means it is painfully bad . The plot ? Well , if you were 6 years old , then you could have written this movie . Simplistic , idealistic , and just plain lame .

neg	Amy Heckerling 's second film Johnny Dangerously is a parody of 1930 's gangster films made in the Warner Brothers ' tradition . Michael Keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at his life of hard knocks when he catches a kid trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935 . Keaton 's mother ( Maureen Stapleton ) has continuing health problems , so Keaton falls into crime at an early age via Peter Boyle . Meanwhile , the fargan Richard Dimitri plays a rival crime lord to Boyle and Keaton eventually rises through the ranks . Joe Piscopo has a hilarious turn as Danny Vermin , yeah that 's right , Vermin ! Griffin Dunne is Keaton 's younger brother turned district attorney , Glynnis O'Connor his wife , and Marilu Henner plays Keaton 's moll . The film looks notoriously cheap , making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical film . The film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour . Due to the combination of dialog and gags , the film holds its own for the first half , but then it rapidly loses steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half . Keaton chews the scenery doing his best James Cagney impression . Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious , not funny . Piscopo does the " once " bit one time too many . Several supporting actors try to hold up the fort like Danny DeVito , Dom DeLuise , Ray Walston as a street vendor , Alan Hale , Jr. as a desk sergeant , and Sudie Bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady . The second half evolves into a hit or miss television show type tone and never recovers . The closing scene utilizing The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism as is The Call Of The Wild Clark Gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film . I think Heckerling should have known better , since the targeted audience would certainly be aware of The Roaring Twenties ' actual 1939 release date . * 1/2 of 4 stars .
pos	What a surprising treat to come across on late television . Had I only read a brief plot rundown on a television listing before seeing the movie , I would have passed . The idea of a movie about a hit - man - seeing - a shrink - wanting - to leave - the - business - and - falling - in - love .... sounds trite . But the film works . From the start of the movie , it 's clear the man carries a weight on his shoulders , before he even says a word . The look and feel of the film is perfect . dark , but not obnoxiously so . Aside from the hit - man family aspect which provides a touch of surrealism , Macy 's character grapples with his marriage , and his father 's control . Macy shows a repressed sadness , and his bedtime talks with his young son are amazing . The young boy shows acting skills well beyond his years , and the interaction between the father and son is so very natural , personal and loving . This is one of the best movies I 've seen in a while , and I ca n't believe I came across it by accident on late night television .
neg	From the stupid " quaint African natives " travelogue footage with our badly - superimposed principals acting as narrators , to the horrible fake ears which transform docile Indian elephants into African elephants , to the utter lack of any logic at all , to Maureen O'Sullivan 's incessant whining of " Tarzan ! Tarzan ! " , there is nothing about this movie which deserves classic status . 4/10
pos	just watched it on sky TV missed the first half an hour . i did wonder if it was a true story so watched it to the end . there was no brief at the end to say what happened to everyone . it did remind me of speed but at the end of the day i do n't suppose it was released at the cinema as we did see the following error . the goof that we saw was that they remove the bonnet ( hood ) and then later on there are two shots of the car with the police car in front trying to slow it down when the bonnet is back on . it did have me on the edge of my seat especially when i thought the baby was going to hit the bridge and of course when the bridge was n't going to be lowered and then it was . I 'm afraid i did burst into tears so it was n't that bad ! ! ! !
neg	This movie is absolutely pointless , one of the good esamples how Malcom McDowall never got one decent role after Clockwork Orange . This one may be one of the worst though . No story , crappy special effects , shot in 4:3/or even worse cropped on DVD , just avoid it ....
pos	This is a very funny Ealing comedy about a community in central London who , through an unusual set of circumstances , discover they are not English , but are an annex of the French province of Burgundy . The film features comic actor Stanley Holloway ( best known as Alfred Doolittle in MY FAIR LADY ) , as well as a host of other classic comic actors of the period . The story was apparently based on a news item at the time , when the Canadian Government " officially " gave a hotel room to a visiting European member of royalty . The idea actually reminded me of the real - life case of the Hutt River Province in Western Australia , where a landowner " seceded " from the Australian Government due to a wool quota dispute . ( It was never acknowledged by the Western Australian or Australian Governments ) . This is a great script that plays with a lot of political and economic issues , rather like the TV show " Yes Minister " ; as well as being a great little eccentric character piece as well .
neg	Yes , the first " Howling " was a classic . A rather good werewolf movie that I admit started slowly , but gained momentum along the way to have a rather good finish then the anchorwoman changed into a cute werewolf only to be gunned down on camera . Yes that made for an entertaining horror movie to be sure ... well forget all of that as this movie has nothing to do with that film . Oh sure , they kind of make it out that the anchor woman is the same and that her brother or something is wanting to find out what and why things went down as they did , but they go from the little cozy retreat from the first movie to Transylvania or somewhere here where they must battle evil magician werewolves or something . I often wonder what in the world Christopher Lee was doing in this movie , however I read the trivia here where it says he had never been in a werewolf movie before , but still read the script before you take a role . Maybe you could have gotten into " An American Werewolf in London " hell that could have been possible . It was set in London after all . Heck , werewolves do not seem to figure much into this movie except for a rather bizarre and prolonged sex scene . In fact , the most memorable death in this movie for me was when the one gal started talking loudly and this one dude 's ear 's started bleeding .
pos	This movie awed me so much that I watch it at least once a year . At times I find it uncomfortable . At times I find it empowering . And I always find the characters human and real . It is a movie that shows you the gritty reality of life in LA , starting with the recurring helicopter search lights scanning for the dangers lurking so close to the ordinary lives being carried on by the characters . It is also a movie that shows you how the kindness of a stranger can change your life and empower you to make a difference . Grand Canyon reminds you that every action you take , whether intended or not , has powerful repercussions . I found this movie to be similar in many ways to Robert Altman 's film Short Cuts . Both had a star - studded roster of perfectly cast actors & actresses and both movies allowed you to gradually see how the the characters interrelated with one another and affected each other , for better or worse . Grand Canyon did a better job of providing a cohesive message , ( hope in the face of despairing reality ) , than Altman 's film , although I found them both intriguing in their own way . This film is a definite must see ! ! !
neg	I think my summary sums it up . I found it inane and stupid . I also saw the ending a mile a way . Everyone is copying that ending anymore when doing a TV / Theater crossover anymore . Sometimes , it 's better to let the movie stand alone . Others , its better to forget the movie altogether . This is one of the others ....
pos	While this movie is n't a classic by any stretch , it is very entertaining as I remember it . I saw it about 15 years ago on HBO and loved the movie . It was written by the same guy that wrote and directed " Arthur " and though it is n't as funny as that movie , it does show the potential that Steve Gordon reached with " Arthur " .
neg	I remember watching the BSG pilot . I can describe that night exactly . I remember what chair I sat in . That show was magic . It came alive . I enjoyed the first two years of BSG . I enjoyed parts of the third year even , and I watched every episode of the fourth year , totally faithfully in great hopes that it would somehow turn around . Well , it did n't . I watched the Caprica pilot and was enthralled . There was hope for something good here . Then I started watching the regular episodes , and they are getting more and more boring . It 's too obvious , too predictable . It reminds me of the droll political correctness of his last failed show , Virtuality . Much of his line work on DS9 was good . When he focused on BSG in an organized way , it was good . This was especially true early on when they more or less followed the pattern of episodes set by the first BSG series . When they departed from that after meeting up with Admiral Cain and the Pegasus , it all went to pot . It was like he wrote the rest of the show without knowing where he was going . Maybe it will improve . Maybe it was just a few weak initial episodes . But I am very , very nervous .
pos	I 'll tell you a tale of the summer of 1994 . A friend and I attended a Canada Day concert in Barrie , and it was a who 's who of the top Canadian bands of the age . We got there about 4 am , waited in line most of the morning , and when the doors opened at 9 am , we were among the first inside the gates . We then waited and waited in the hot sun , slowly broiling but we did n't care , because the headliners were among our favourites . At one point , early in the afternoon , I sat down and dozed off with my back to the barrier . I was awakened to my shock and dismay by a shrieking girl wearing a Rheostatics t - shirt . This is the reason I have hated the Rheostatics to this day . There 's nothing reasonable , nor taste - determined , nor really anything except their fandom . Snotty of me , is n't it ? So , I , in my hatred of the band , have denied myself the delight that is Whale Music . Desmond Howl had it all . It 's hard to say what he 's lost , since he lives in a fantastic mansion wedged between the ocean and the mountains ( the BC region where the movie was shot is breathtaking ) . The life most of us dream of is dismantled by dreams , phantoms , and his own past , until the day a teenaged criminal breaks in ... and , trite as it sounds , breaks him out . Canadian cinema suffers from several problems . Generally , a lack of money , as well as an insufferable lack of asking for help ( as if somehow the feature would cease to be Canadian ) leads to lower production values than American or British films , and most people do n't like to watch anything that sounds or looks like , well , not like an American film . Next , Canadian screenwriters often seem so caught up in being weird that they lose sight of how to tell a good story , and tell it well . Third , they seem to think that gratuitous nudity ( often full - frontal ) makes something artistic . I 'm sure anyone who watches enough Canadian movies , especially late at night on the CBC , knows exactly what I 'm talking about . It 's almost like a " do n't do this " handbook exists out there somewhere and Canadian film - makers threw it out a long time ago . In the 90s and 00s , however , some films ( such as Bruce McDonald 's work and the brilliant C.R.A.Z.Y. ) have broken this mold , and managed to maintain what makes them Canadian , while holding onto watchable production values and great stories . Whale Music is such a film , on the surface . Deeper than just its Canadian - isms , it 's a deeply moving story of a man who 's lost his grip , through grief and excess , who is redeemed by music then by love . And that redeems even the Rheostatics . :)
neg	In what I can say was a theft of my time I was taken to see this movie and I must say what a horrible experience . Fay Ann Lee is a terrible actress and is unconvincing in this movie . Larryjoe76 is obviously a shill reviewer . The plot is thin to say the least , the Cantonese dialog is not funny . See this movie at your peril . David Tang from Shanghai Tang should be after the movie for the little or no revenue this movie will generate . The banal plot attempts to compete with other rom - coms out there , and just blends into the scenery . It was like watching paint dry .   In short this movie was a total waste of time and space . I 've seen better movies on youtube .
pos	Anyone find it interesting that the Ood look strangely similar to the ' Great Cthulhu ' of H P Lovecraft vintage ? hmmm ?   Great pair of episodes ( not referring to Billie Piper as most seem to do ! ) in The impossible Planet and The Satan Pit . Also the link to ' Legion ' I think also used in Who before and also referring to Satan in various novels post Exorcist era ... Great suspense episodes utilising fear and faith elements . The new team for these ' who 's are working great magic for TV . This certainly creates new fears and ' hide behind the sofa ' feelings not seen for many , many years in this continuation of a superb BBC series ( pity it is confirmed by the BBC that Billie Piper is quitting - perhaps not permanently - after end of series 2 ) : O ( ( (
neg	The movie was " OK " . Not bad , not good , just OK . If there was anything else in the theater this would be skipped by far . Sadly , Fast and Furious 2 also stunk , but I 'd rather see this than FF2 . :) If you have a fetish for harrison ford or that other young punk , this will be a " cute " movie for you . Personally , I 'd wait for HBO or Blockbuster .
pos	Everyone in the cast , from Sugiyama to Aoki and Toyoko is someone we know in everyday life . They were so natural , and Sugiyama 's transformation is incredibly believable . The score is so moving , it brought me to tears . The choreography was beautiful without seeming athletic . Mai 's graceful dancing and charm gave me goosebumps . Tamako is such a wonderfully delightful character . You can almost see the charmed schoolgirl in her face as she reminisces about seeing " The King and I " . Aoki 's character is both hilarious and pitiful . Masako is so overwhelmingly natural as the bewildered wife , you almost want to hug her to reassure her that everything will be all right . This film is truly a keeper .
neg	First of all , this plot is way overdone - girl wants to make it , everyone loves her , snobby girl intervenes , all looks lost , girl pulls through , everyone loves her again etc . Throw in the fitting in thing , an attractive male crushing on the heroine , plus single - parent troubles and it 's so predictable that you can practically recite along with it . Second of all , I really hate how they keep on dissing classical music . They send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is uptight and snobby and close - minded - in fact , I do n't recall the quote exactly , but I remember at one point in the movie , Holly says , " Why do they have to be so uptight ... so classical ? " It 's really insulting how label classical music in this way . Third , I 've went over it dozens of times , but the only reason that I can think of for making this movie is to promote Britney Spears . there just is n't any point at all . And oh yeah , while the actress who portrayed Holly ( I 'm not sure whether that was really her singing or not ) had a reasonably good voice , it was n't as amazing as they were making it out to be - especially when she was belting . She was oversupporting the whole time . 1/10 stars .
pos	I love this anime ! I was laughing my head off with all of the jokes and the violence ( mostly from Akane Ranma 's reluctant but short tempered " fiancee")is so slapstick however Ranma does deserve it but he does try his best to make amends ... clumsily . The main character Ranma goes to China to train only to fall into the cursed Jusenkkyo Spring and turns into a girl when splashed by cold water . From then on it 's pure chaos one after another . Among the stand outs are the deranged brother and sister duo of Kuno and Kodachi , the sexy Shampoo , the pervert Happosai all causing trouble for our hero / heroine . However it is Ranma 's selfish father Genma who winds up being the culprit for the mess most of the time . If anyone want an anime that 's funny , this is the one . It 's cuter and better with the Japanese dub .
neg	At least it 's not full of sensless violence or fluff . It 's also not very full of thought or a smooth storyline . This story had some potential but the director appears to have lost site of the green . The story is disjointed and goes off in strange directions , to no conclusion . I also do n't believe the director spent much time around a golf country club , either . Some of the depictions are absurd . Not very engaging .
pos	Maybe not the most original way of telling a story , we 've seen all this before in many movies .. but .. I liked it October Sky alot anyways . It got something , Great directing and good acting by all parts , especially Laura Dern(the teacher ) and Chris Cooper(the father ) . I wanna be a rocket - engineer ! : )
neg	This is a typical late Universal Horror flick : its technically comptent , if by the numbers , with a cookie cutter plot and some serious overacting . The most interesting part of this film is its stunt casting of Rondo Hatton , a man with a bone disease as the film 's " monster " . Its sad to see this man exploited , but he probably made good use of the money they paid him . Hatton is less horrifying than the studio hoped , as I more often felt pity over fear or even loathing . Martin Koslack is on board as the film 's mad artist , and he is very amusing in this part . I for one enjoy seeing Koslack in just about anything ; for some reason the man amuses me . The only other part of the film that entertained me is the film 's absurd take on the art world . Here we are shown evil art critics who revel in their ability to break artists ; this is side by side with the film 's male " hero " who is an " artist " who paints ... get this ... pin up girls . Somehow our hero 's work is reviewed side by side with the villan 's absurdist sculpture . Also amusing is the film 's chief nasty critic , who at one point claims that he despises the hero 's pin up art because " women like that do n't exist " to which our heroine replies with an assurance that the critic just does n't get out enough . Finally , there 's a bit of a subplot about the heroine 's ( who is an art critic herself ) domestication by the leading man .... completely anti - feminist and ridiculous to witness . Overall this film is a rather mediocre picture with a few amusing elements .
pos	Foley 's noir quality in this saturated and intense pulp film is seemingly " perfectly " fit together . Shot by shot , edit by edit , the film unfolds itself around a disturbed boxer discovering his own purpose ( or lack thereof ) . The other comments around perhaps indicate a lack of pulp interest , but I personally think this is a superbly put together cinematic piece !
neg	ALMOST GOLDEN : THE JESSICA SAVITCH STORY Aspect ratio : 1.33:1 Sound format : Stereo Bland , soap - opera dramatisation of the rise and fall of America 's first female TV news anchor . With a tighter script and direction - and a better cast - this might have passed muster , but the flimsy story really was n't worth the effort . A good documentary on the subject might have been the best way to go . Typically strong production values in the TV movie conveyor - belt manner , but it 's all as superficial as old fluff , and just as engaging .
pos	This was on at 2 or so In the morning one Saturday a few years ago , for various reasons I do n't remember the entire story but what remains are the two standout performances from the central characters . Dom has had a unfortunate lot , manipulated & literally working a rubbish job , Eugene torn between personal aspirations and duty towards his sibling . Tom Hulce ' Dom does n't plead for sympathy - It comes naturally . Ray Liotta Is a universe away from Henry Hill , displaying a soft centre In what must feel a thankless position . In many ways this deals with the dilemma many young carer 's face - the past or the future . As It turns out , with some work the two can happily co - exist . Thoughtfully handled & sensitively played Dominick & Eugene Is difficult not to warm to .
neg	After seeing the credits with only one name that I recognize and that was the preacher in this film ( Russ Conway ) , I did not expect much from this film and I was not disappointed . A man is planning on killing his new wife by convincing other people that she is insane and will take her own life . Unbeknown to the husband is that the plastic looking skull that he uses , in contrast , a ghost of a woman apparently his first dead wife has revenge on her mind and uses a real skull . A simple plot with a twist of irony at the end . If you are tired late one night and in need of sleep , this will help you to sleep that sleep .
pos	This movie is witty , watchable and utterly touching . And now often do you get to see Jean Harlow ( or any actress of this era , for that matter ) give another woman a swift punch in the jaw ? ( Twice ! ) After Harlow 's Ruby is sent to a reformatory after getting mixed up with Gable 's Edward Hall ( he of that cheesy yet endearing crooked smile ) , her predicament becomes all the more complicated when she discovers that she is pregnant , and she 's convinced that this rake has abandoned her , but in fact , her love has reformed him and he comes to see her , despite the fact that he will be arrested , and from the help of a minister , are married . The wonderful relationship that Harlow shares with her fellow inmates is second only to her electric chemistry with Gable , who was her most frequent leading man . Her cynical character is a perfect match for Gable 's smooth - talking crook . What 's not to like ? " You know , you would n't be a bad looking dame - if it was n't for your face ! " Ruby cuttingly remarks to Gypsy , her rival . " If you 're going to get that close to me , I 'll have to open the other window ! " Priceless ! ! !
neg	I 'm not to keen on The Pallbearer , it 's not too bad , but just very slow at the times . As the movie goes on , it gets a little more interesting , but nothing brilliant . I really like David Schwimmer and I think he 's good here . I 'm not a massive Gwyneth Paltrow fan , but I do n't mind her sometimes and she 's okay here . The Pallbearer is not a highly recommended movie , but if you like the leads then you might enjoy it .
pos	I remember seeing this in a the Salem movie theater ( where I used to attend " Kiddie Matinée"s almost every Saturday ) in Dayton , Ohio when I was a young boy and have never forgotten it . It simply amazed me and my friends . I do wish there were some way I could see it again ! I have tried to find some compilation of shorts or something like that to no avail . I only recently discovered that it was a Cousteau film and that blew my mind even more . How the heck he accomplished this is beyond my understanding . The fish is ACTUALLY IN THE CAT 'S MOUTH at one point , if I remember correctly ! If anyone could help me find a way to see it again I would be extremely grateful !
neg	I saw this not too long ago , and I must say : This movie is terrible . I watch crappy movies for fun . Scarecreow is not fun . Scarecrow is stupid . You have an incredibly corny villain that enjoys screaming awful puns as he kills his victims(actually worse than the one contained in this sentence ) . He has his hard luck story that he uses to justify his killings . " Everyone picks on me . The only girl that thinks I 'm not trailer - trash likes one of the guys that pick on me . I want to kill everybody . Wah . " OK , I 'm exaggerating . But the premise to this movie alone is enough to put it near the bottom of the list of crappy movies . Adding to what I just said , the kid 's mom is promiscuous , he walks in on his mother and her current boyfriend getting it on , mom 's boyfriend tells him to leave , kid refuses , insisting that he is n't going to leave his own house . Boyfriend chases kid into corn field . He kills kid right in front of mom , mom screams in terror , boyfriend is like , " OMG ! I did n't mean to ! " Then he tells mom not to say anything to the police about it . Kid was killed under a scarecrow , though . So , like any kid who gets murdered under a scarecrow , he comes back as a killer scarecrow with a vengeance . His victims " have n't been stalked like this before ... " ( Scarecrow 's official tag line ) To make matters worse , this movie was filmed in a whopping 8 days . That 's right , 8 days . I was going to give this movie a 2 , because in spite of itself , it has one or two redeeming moments . ( They 're spoilers , so I wo n't spoil it for you , if you actually want to see this crap . ) I could have somewhat forgiven the bad acting , the horrible special effects , the abysmal script , and the bad camera work , but I simply have no respect for lack of effort on that level . This movie is n't nearly as good as I 'm making it out to be . If you want to see an example of how not to make a movie , or if you enjoy watching bad movies , like I do , then watch this at your own risk . Everyone else should stay a safe distance away from this movie at all times .
pos	I really enjoyed the first episode and am looking forward to more . A little soft on the crime front ( it 's almost an afterthought and not terribly suspenseful or fleshed out ) but thought the romance angle was wonderfully charming . Will be watching again for sure !   I 'm hoping that they 'll have a bigger role for the aunts who are wonderful actresses and were somewhat underused this time around . The actress who plays the assistant / waitress ( also from Bewitched I think ) is very sweet and bubbly and comes off as nicely dorky and sweet instead of dumb and annoying which is very nice . Check it out .
neg	Just saw this at the Chicago Film Festival - avoid it at all costs unless you have sleep problems . It is a film filled with pretensions - it opens with a minor quote from " Hiroshima mon amour " and it 's all downhill from there . Camera work - imagine a child trying to imitate Wong Kar Wai . Story line - Smokey Robinson and the Miracles ' " The Love I saw in You Was Just a Mirage " expanded from 3 minutes to over 2 hours but filled with repetition . For butt numbing pain this film ranks with the benches at the Methodist church my parent dragged me to when I was a kid . I want 2 + hours of my life refunded . Julian Hernandez 's promoter prefaced the viewing with comment that the film was " controversial " - that is true only for the film 's narcotic effect .
pos	An axellent second installment that manages to be just as good as the first .   Once again , the casting is just wonderful . I like how the first and second episode have nothing in common except for the wit and cleverness . The second episode is just very funny , very silly and very enjoyable . It is the very first Christmas episode , about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as Santa after having killed her own husband . Just like the first episode ; karma . The most humorous scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call , first faking her fear until it becomes real .
neg	Bottom of the barrel , unimaginative , and practically unwatchable remake of THE ROAD WARRIOR . This film follows the exact plot as the Filipino film STRYKER and is worse by far ! Bad acting , dialog , effects , dubbing , pacing , action sequences ... The list goes on and on . Italy made literally dozens of Road Warrior rip - offs in the early 80 's , some good , some bad . This is the worst by far , no contest . Not only was the mood of the film completely bleak and miserable , the experience of sitting through this one is a bore and a half . There was 1 ( one ) good chase sequence towards the beginning of the movie , and a cool shot of a man holding a hand grenade exploding . But EVERYTHING else about this movie seriously reeks ! For actual post - nuke fun , go track down a copy of ENDGAME , AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK , or ESCAPE FROM THE BRONX instead . They 're much more enjoyable than this rubbish .
pos	Wrapped in gorgeous English country backgrounds , Emma is a delicious confection to be relished for dreamy getaways . Emma ( Gwyneth Paltrow ) is a graceful , intelligent young woman who has just married off her governess -- and confidant -- to a marriage which Emma takes the credit in matchmaking . Eager to use her talent in arranging things for the people around her , she decides to match the vicar , Mr. Elton ( Alan Cummings ) with her pretty young friend , Harriet ( Toni Collette ) . The result is a series of mixed signals and mistaken interpretations that end up sorting themselves out , with Emma learning that she did not have as much control over events as she thought . The film is full of Jane Austen 's witty and wry characterizations . Gwyneth Paltrow is at her best , portraying this maiden of a restrained , polite society with wit and ease . Her growing romance with the unparalleled Mr. Knightley ( Jeremy Northam ) is the heart of this film . Mr. Knightley is one of the greatest romantic leading men in films . He is incredibly handsome , in a modest , relaxed way that is irresistible . He is certainly well - matched to Gwyneth Paltrow . Their charming friendship that began when he was 16 and she was an infant , has blossomed as he , a family friend , matches wits with her in an older brotherly fashion that grows into something more . With a wry look or understated jab at Emma , Northam 's Knightley is a delight to watch . Other wonderful characterizations include the comic Juliet Stevenson , Greta Scacchi , Ewan McGregor , Polly Walker , and the talkative spinster , Miss Bates , who is very funny . Seeming shorter and more flowing than most Jane Austin adaptations , Emma has comic rhythm that promises true enjoyment .
neg	The cast is OK . The script is awkward at times , and it takes a while to figure out what the point of the movie is . I found myself looking forward to doing the dishes . The Shehan bit is a cheesy statement on the war . I guess we were supposed to not notice it ... we did . Its a house , you did nothing more than kill forty five minutes . The shower part ... huh ? What was that about ? Literally , it is I have a client , " Ok you can use our shower . " Yawn . The angles are trying way to hard . There was a set of woods , suddenly its gone cause you can see right through , then next it is deep and animals are dying . In the end this is a horrendous movie of boring proportions .
pos	All the folks who sit here and say that this movie 's weak link is the Ramones would probably say that Amadeus was ok if not for that irritating harpsichordist . Rock and Roll High School was centered around the Ramones . How anyone can watch this and not get a kick out of Joey Ramone eating bean sprouts backstage in an attempt to keep him in performing condition is obviously a wet blanket square daddy - o . Ms Trogar , exploding white mice , the hall patrols ... instant classics . Nevermind the Riff Randell character . If you do n't like the Ramones then you do n't know rock and roll and you do n't deserve to watch a movie called ROCK AND ROLL High School .
neg	First , a little summary . This reporter named Torch is basically trying to get out the story of a zombie outbreak and finds the military & government censoring him . Nice message , government censorship and all that , but the way they DID the movie was , well let me explain . This movie is beyond description . The idea that somebody holds it in higher regard than anything by George Romero is justification enough for the reviewer to be committed to a mental institution . The script is atrocious on its own , like it was written by a sixth grader . As for special effects , I understand that independent films have low budgets , and some gore effects looked acceptable , but if you want a scene with fire , here 's a tip : buy some nonflammable material , have an extinguisher ready , and get a fire going ! Do n't digitally add it in and make it look like an explosion from a Nintendo 64 game . The acting , well let 's put it this way . In my summer theater program , a cold reading of the script is , compared to this , The Godfather . I wo n't even go into the inconsistencies . Find them yourself . What disturbed me the most , though , was when everything was finished after shooting and editing , somebody might have said , " Okay , this looks good . Let 's release it . " It sends a chill down my spine to even think about it , to think somebody felt that this was good enough for DVD release . This is n't DVD quality . This is n't Sci - Fi channel quality . Hell , this is n't even film school quality . If you were to submit this in for a project at a film school , you would get an F. No , not even an F , more like an F- . I would n't be surprised if he would try to get you expelled . I felt used after I saw this thing . Blockbuster and the makers of this movie have my money right now , and I 'd prefer not to think of what they 're doing with it . I have been the pawn of some elaborate , nefarious scheme at legalized theft , and it does n't feel good to think that I walked right into it , looking at the back cover with pleasant memories of 28 Days Later only to find a film Ed Wood would watch and say afterwards , " I did n't much care for this . " This film is the single most terrible movie I have seen . I have not seen anything by Ed Wood , but I have confidence this is worse . If you are looking for serious cinema , so much as being within ten feet of it will probably give you a bad headache . If not , I still recommend that you personally write the director and ask how he sleeps at night . However , if you are the kind of person who get a laugh out of really bad stuff then I recommend you check this out . You wo n't be disappointed .
pos	when i first heard about this movie i thought it would be like The Duchess(2008 ) , but when i saw the first 30 minutes of The Young Victoria i knew this would n't just be a solid movie . Almost everything in this movie is great , the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully shot . The only thing that really let me down are the performances . Emily Blunt(The Devil Wears Prada ) is the star of the film , bringing Victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is a great actress and maybe picking a first Oscar nomination for her performance . Rupert Friend is almost bland as Prince Albert but he has great chemistry with Emily Blunt . Paul Bettany is also solid as Lord Melbourne although i expected more of him . Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettable . To me the film feels like unfinished . Maybe that the screenwriters changed too many things in the script , i do n't know but that 's how i feel about the movie . But overall it 's a great movie about the early years of Victoria with a Great performance from Emily Blunt .
neg	It 's been a long time since I last saw a movie this bad .. The acting is very average , the story is horribly boring , and I 'm at a loss for words as to the execution . It was completely unoriginal . O , and this is as much a comedy as Clint Eastwood 's a pregnant Schwarzenegger !   One of the first scenes ( the one with the television show - where the hell are you ? ) got it right - the cast was 80 % of let 's face it - forgotten actors . If they were hoping for a career relaunch , then I think it might never happen with this on their CV ! The script had the potential , but neither 80 % of the actors nor the director ( who 's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor ) pulled it off . Fred Durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest . I 'm sorry , but if you ever consider watching this - I highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic , because not only it 's a total loss of time , but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like .
pos	This one stood out for it 's originality . I 'm seriously tired of seeing Hindi movies that are a hotch - potch of a whole bunch of Hollywood and Brit movies . Some flaws were inevitable , nonetheless , this movie is a must - see . Surya 's portrayal of the clean - cut , conscientious cop ( as opposed to the pot - bellied , money - hungry ones that we normally see ) was awesome . He 's come a long way from his work in Nerukku Ner . I liked the movie so much that I had to own it . I 'm not usually into the mindless violence type of movies , somehow I actually felt for each character and therefore ca n't really bring myself to call it ' mindless ' violence . I do not appreciate the excessive melodrama and sentimental scenes that go hand in hand with most Hindi and Tamil movies . I absolutely loved this movie for it 's lack of the same . ACP Anbuselvan 's reaction to loosing his wife , is not overdone , is heart - wrenching and makes me want to bawl my eyes out . There are certain times when I 'm watching a movie when I want to hit the FF button . Plenty of times I 've wanted to do that at a cinema hall . Never wanted to do so when watching this movie . I 'm really hoping that Ghajini releases soon .
neg	This movie is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen . From the very first scene , i knew it would be a smash crash . It starts with a seemingly bad girl killing a bunch of nuns in a mission . As it turns out , the people in it were possessed by some random zombies . Well , some years later , some college kids are pulling some pledge prank . Horrible acting goes from pledge to the head jock . Things like the jock yelling at him to do stuff in quite a non - chalonte manner , with pledge over reacting and over - doing the whole " eager to be popular role " What really took the cake with this one is the final battle . Absolutely HORRIBLE special effects with the guns . For example , guns making a noise with no muzzle flash , and vice - versa . this is accompanied by stop - animation zombies ( why they move in stop motion is a mystery ) , cheesy music , and about 40 guns that come out of nowhere . Overall , this movie is crap . Just like so many others you can rent for 50 cents at your nearest low brow movie rental place .
pos	A bizarre and brilliant combination of talents between the director , Robert Siodmak and Ella Raines as a secretary trying to save her boss from the electric chair by tracking down a mysterious " phantom " woman , and Franchot Tone as a crazed and murderous sculptor . As well there are some fascinating smaller parts played by Elisha Cook Jr as a drugged out trap drummer , as well as the other characters who make up parts of the conspiracy . If you 're used to seeing Raines in more wholesome parts , she 's allowed to go overboard here , especially in her scenes with Cook . Franchot Tone also plays someone very different , and though it is n't a convincing part , he acts phenomenally . While the conspiracy is too contrived , the film has real atmosphere and is very interesting .
neg	I think its time for Seagal to go quietly into the night . What I have just seen makes all his direct to video releases in the last few years look like his early 90 's smash hits in comparison . A secret bio lab is making a new kind of drug that jacks up a human 's adrenaline system to the point where they become psychopathic killers or something . Somehow Seagal is supposed to stop the infection or its the end of the world ... or something . Seagal also went through hit squads like jellybeans , every time I look up he was commanding a new face so it kinda got hard to follow character development as well I know Steven 's athsma prevent him from yelling at the top of his lungs but even so why is he constantly being dubbed by people who sound nothing like him ? Usually the films plot and action sequences can save it from being a total waste of time but this was not even close . Like I said , it was more of a horror movie with a lot of blood and shank stabbing rather than straight up fighting . The problem was it was n't really scary and Seagal looked completely out of place because the infected people were supposed to have speed of light movement yet the 40 year old 280 lb Seagal killed them all singlehandedly ? I guess the lone highlight of the movie was the first 20 minutes where the new recruits ask Seagal to come to the strip club with them . 2 out of 10
pos	" The Matador " is a dark comedy starring Pierce Brosnan as an aging hit man who befriends a straight - arrow , happily - married American businessman ( Greg Kinnear ) in Mexico . Although the sardonic Julian ( ironically surnamed " Noble " ) appears to be a " tough guy " on the surface , underneath he is really just a mass of neuroses and insecurities , a man who realizes that his chosen profession has left him virtually alone in the world and friendless . Thus on his birthday , he reaches out to Danny , a man who has lived his life playing by the rules and who becomes strangely intrigued by Julian 's " unconventional " lifestyle . In fact , both men find in each other the person they could never be but wish they could become in their quieter , franker moments of self - evaluation . Although the film is a bit too reminiscent of " Analyze This " and " Midnight Run " to feel entirely fresh and original , " The Matador , " nevertheless , earns points for the complexity of its characters and the quality of its acting . Brosnan , looking aged and almost used up , sinks his teeth into the role of Julian in a way he never has before . Playing a man who seems constitutionally unable to make a serious connection with another human being , Brosnan is flip and cavalier one moment , then genuine and sympathetic the next . He always keeps us off balance so that the humor never becomes crass or stale . Kinnear is also excellent as the Regular Joe businessman who finds himself pulled ever more to the Dark Side as his relationship with Julian deepens . Hope Davis does a fine job as " Bean , " Danny 's loyal and loving wife who , like her husband , finds herself intrigued by this mysterious and " dangerous " figure from a world far different from the one she knows . At times , we find ourselves feeling that " The Matador " is holding something back from us , not quite plumbing the depths of its situation and premise . At the end it feels a little too light , a little too insubstantial to register the impact it should . This could be because this is the feature film debut for writer / director Richard Shephard , and he has n't quite gotten his movie pacing down yet . Still , one appreciates the fact that he does n't always go for the obvious and that he keeps tightly focused on the two main figures in the piece , rarely settling for the trite setup or the easy laugh . ' The Matador " is a flawed but generally entertaining little comedy that will , hopefully , signal a new phase in Brosnan 's acting career .
neg	Who was George C. Scott ? George C. Scott was a renowned actor . Practically any movie that he 's been in is the better off for it . Now ol' George had absolutely NOTHING to do with this movie ... , but he once said something that describes said movie to a T. I do n't recall his exact words , but he basically said that Great Writing can Save Bad Acting , But Great Acting CanNOT save Bad Writing . Never has this little observation been truer than in " The All New Adventures of Laurel & Hardy : For Love or Mummy " . The casting of the two leads was absolutely perfect . Bronson Pinchot ( Laurel ) and Gailard Sartain ( Hardy ) not only look the parts , but they do an exceptionally good job at mimicking the real deal ( mannerisms and all ) . This movie should stand as a lasting testament to their talents . That said , this movie falls flat on its face when it comes to ( you guessed it ) WRITING . Aside from the opening dialogue between Pinchot and Sartain ( which was very " in character " ) and a brief gag involving a taxi , this movie is an absolute chore to sit through . PROBLEM # 1 : Too much time and effort went into the plot . I do n't want to know why the mummy wants to kidnap the pretty British lady . What I WANT is to see Stan and Ollie ( or at least , their stand - ins ) . Way too much screen time was devoted to explaining the plot or to the not - very - funny secondary characters that said plot revolved around . However , even if this movie had been all jokes , that would still leave us with ... ... PROBLEM # 2 : Most of the jokes are what I would call " watered - down " slapstick .   What do I mean by " watered down " ? In slapstick , a character gets hurt in an exaggerated way for comedic effect ( ala Looney Tunes , 3 Stooges ... ,or how about Laurel & Hardy ? ) . In " watered - down " slapstick ( as I define it ) , a character gets mildly hurt or inconvenienced , and the filmmakers play that up for comedic effect . Maybe an illustration would help : In Looney Tunes , Daffy Duck gets shot by Elmer Fudd . His bill falls off and he puts it back on . That is classic slapstick . In this " gem " , Ollie accidentally bumps into some people . They turn around , tell him to be careful , and continue on their merry way . That 's not slapstick . That 's not even funny . That 's just ... boring ... and this movie is full of these kinds of jokes . It 's as though they 're this movie 's bread and butter . The writers and directors just take these dull moments and act like they 're supposed to be funny . Granted , the example I just gave is the most extreme case , but I can only cut it so much slack . Long story short : The film just does n't work because the script fails to capitalize on Pinchot 's and Sartain 's abilities to impersonate Stan and Ollie . Instead , the script capitalizes on plot exposition and lame jokes . Watching this movie is basically watching two excellent impersonators who were given no real material to work with . Not a good movie , but an incredible sleeping aid . I say give this one a miss and stick with the real deal ( just so long as you steer clear of " Atoll K " and " Be Big " ) .
pos	This is one of the best Fred Astaire - Ginger Rogers films , or at least one of my favorites . Most of the A - R movies feature great dancing but sappy romance stories . This still has the courtship corniness but not as pronounced as the other films . This movie features not just great dancing but likable characters and a bunch of good songs . The music is the central theme here and what 's nice is the addition of a tap solo by Rogers . She not only was a super dancer but a very pretty woman and one with tremendous figure . She dances also with Fred , of course , and they 're always a fun pair to watch on the dance floor . Growing up in the 1950s watching " Ozzie & Harriet " on television , it was a real kick the first time I saw this to see such a young Harriet Hilliard . No surprise than Ozzie fell for this beauty . Although she had that short early ' 30s hairstyle , I recognized her voice right away . Also in this movie are quick appearances by Betty Grable and Lucille Ball , but I have to admit that I have yet to out Ball . I ca n't find her , but I know she 's in here . Astaire , except for some obnoxious gum - chewing in the first third of the film , was fun to watch and Randolph Scott - although better in westerns - is likable , too . This is simply a nice , feel - good film and good one if you want to to enjoy the great talents of Astaire and Rogers .
neg	I totally agree with the review by a reviewer of Variety that the film is never quite as funny , lively or insightful about the creative process as its premise would seem to warrant . Narratively it is messy and the lighting is really problematic . If the film is supposed to be character - driven the poor lighting does n't enhance the acting and it is sometimes difficult to observe the facial expressions of the actors . Many non - South Africans will have difficulty in following the spoken English in the film and some of the local humor will be lost in the process . I watched the film at the Cape Town World Cinema festival last year . Comments and reactions to the film ranged from unwatchable and sloppy to a welcome departure from the films about our painful past . Unfortunately Bunny Chow wo n't be remembered as one of the bright lights of the South African New Wave , but some of the remarkable films about our apartheid history will indeed be rated among our best in our 110 year old film history . Not surprisingly the film disappeared from cinemas in Cape Town only two weeks after its release and from most of the cinemas in Durban and Gauteng . It has clearly limited appeal among South African audiences .
pos	Hood of the Living Dead had a lot to live up to even before the opening credits began . First , any play on " ... of the living dead " invokes His Holiness Mr. Romero and instantly sets up a high standard to which many movies can not afford to aspire . And second , my movie - watching companion professed doubt that any urban horror film would surpass the seminal Leprechaun In the Hood . Skeptical , we settled in to watch .   We were rewarded with a surprisingly sincere and good - hearted zombie film . Oh , certainly the budget is low , and of course the directors ' amateurs friends populate the cast , but Hood of the Living Dead loves zombie cinema . Cheap ? Yeah . But when it 's this cheap , you can clearly see where LOVE holds it together .   Ricky works in a lab during the day and as a surrogate parent to his younger brother at night . He dreams of moving out of Oakland . Before this planned escape , however , his brother is shot to death in a drive - by . Ricky 's keen scientific mind presents an option superior to CPR or 911 : injections of his lab 's experimental regenerative formula . Sadly , little bro wakes up in an ambulance as a bloodthirsty Oakland zombie ! Chaos and mayhem ! I think it 's more economical to eat your enemies than take vengeance in a drive - by , but then again , I 'm a poor judge of the complexities of urban life . ( How poor a judge ? In response to a gory scene involving four men , I opined " Ah - ha ! White t - shirts on everyone so the blood shows up . Economical ! I used the same technique in my own low - budget horror film . " Jordan replied , " No , that 's gang dress . White t - shirts were banned from New Orleans bars for a time as a result . " Oh . ) A lot of the movie is set in someone 's living room , so there 's a great deal of hanging out and waiting for the zombies . But the characters are sympathetic and the movie is sincere-- it surpasses its budget in spirit .   Zombie explanation : When man plays God , zombies arise ! Or , perhaps : Follow FDA - approved testing rules before human experimentation !   Contribution to the zombie canon : This is the first zombie movie I 've seen with a drive - by shooting . As far as the actual zombies go , infection is spread with a bite as usual , but quite unusually head shots do n't work-- it 's heart shots that kill . Zombies have pulses , the absence of which proves true death . And these zombies make pretty cool jaguar - growl noises .   Gratuitous zombie movie in - joke : A mercenary named Romero . Groan .   Favorite zombie : Jaguar - noise little brother zombie , of course !
neg	The final film for Ernst Lubitsch , completed by Otto Preminger after Lubitsch 's untimely death during production , is a juggling act of sophistication and silliness , romance and music , fantasy and costume dramatics . In a 19th century castle in Southeastern Europe , a Countess falls for her sworn enemy , the leader of the Hungarian revolt ; she 's aided by her ancestor , whose painted image magically comes to life . Betty Grable , in a long blonde wig adorned with flowers , has never been more beautiful , and her songs are very pleasant . Unfortunately , this script ( by Samson Raphaelson , taken from an operetta by Rudolf Schanzer and E. Welisch ) is awash with different ideas that fail to mesh -- or entertain . The results are good - looking , but unabsorbing . * 1/2 from * * * *
pos	For all the Homicide junkies out there , this movie was great ! Every single character that ever was on the show made an appearance in the movie . It helped to resolve some ( but not all ) issues from the series . Unfortunately , unless you actually did watch the series , most of the enjoyment would be lost , as the movie made heavy references to every season of the show 's existence . This probably would have been appropriate as a series finale as opposed to being a separate movie , but we got ta take what we can get . I hope they make more movies , and continue to feature Homicide characters on Law and Order .
neg	Ok so I was bored and I watched it all the way through . This film is mild , inoffensive and lacklustre . The story is so sugary it rots your teeth on the opening titles . A tail of two ' traumatised ' children learning about ' God ' the fairy story way which frankly left me rather traumatised . It uses the Irish ' blarney ' in such a stereotypical way one hopes no true Irish ever see it . Aimed at children who frankly would switch off after the first attempt at an ' OIRISH ' accent . All in all why do they pump these out .
pos	A genuine screaming situation comedy farce of the mid 70s this film was a HUGE hit for about 5 minutes and disappeared off the face of the earth . I am constantly amazed at some comedy films that are a big release one week and then vanish : HIGH ANXIETY , THE CHEAP DETECTIVE , THE BLACK BIRD , DON'T LOOK NOW WE'RE BEING SHOT AT .......... and have no profile at all today . NORMAN was the comedy of the month in whenever 1976 and everyone seemed to see it , laugh about it and then never ever mention it ever again . Famous for being shot on videotape and transferred to film , an experiment at the time , NORMAN is a raucous politically incorrect closet slamming farce that The Farrelly Brothers should look at remaking today . If they had made it in the first place there would be no complaints about its content and slant either . It is very funny and YES very rude and hilariously all wrong . Just as it should be . In fact as a groovy 1976 film with all those horror colours and clothes it actually works better today .
neg	The Eternal Jew ( Der Ewige Jude ) does not have what we today would call the markings of a scholarly document : rather than naming experts or sources to support what it says , it simply says , without opposition , what it wants us to believe ( one will concede that American newsreels of that period were also much less regulated than would seem ethical to a modern audience , often inserting dramatized scenes and passing them off as actual news footage ) . Add to this directed propaganda the fact that filmmaker Hippler was " preaching to the converted , " not so much asking gentile Europeans to hate the Jews as validating the feelings so many of them must have held already , in order to have allowed the holocaust that followed . The weakest link in the film 's logic shows in its " rat " analogy , wherein it goes on to explain the behavior of rats , and then adds something to the effect of " Well , Jewish people are like that too . " Similarly it characterizes Jewish people as ugly by showing ugly Jewish people in comparison to attractive gentiles ; the accompanying leap of faith is that ugly is bad . The film appears to contradict itself a few times , for example by attacking Western painters who portrayed Old Testament characters as light - skinned Europeans ; thereby the text admits that so - called " Hebrew " ethnicity is in fact an ingrained aspect of Christian culture . It also shows ghetto Jews willingly living in roach - infested filth , despite the supposed treasure they 've hoarded , and then flip - flops by saying that these same undesirables live in wealth and luxury as soon as they leave the ghetto . Incidentally , who would n't ? The use of scenes from a well - known American film , House of Rothschild , shows an equally blurry deployment of logic . First the film is denounced as having been made by Jews ; then it is apparently used by Hippler to verify the deceptiveness of Jews ( the aforementioned pretense of poverty by ghetto Jews , shown as a means of avoiding taxation , although the Rothschild character 's " spin " is that Jews are taxed excessively ) ; finally the Rothschild film is once again execrated for implying that the famed banking family invented the checking account . This apparent indecisiveness in whether the American footage is shown positively or negatively might become clearer with repeated viewings , but at first sight it makes for some murky moviewatching . For all of Eternal Jew 's imperfections , I was at first surprised that the IMDb viewer rating for this film is as high as it is , just shy of a " 5 " to date . I 'd say the reason is that EJ 's documentary value has exceeded its original purpose , offering us , unintentionally , a look into the lives of European Jews as they would not be seen a few years hence . Needless to say the film 's very badness also provides an historical insight into bad , or simply evil , filmmaking as a propagandist 's tool . About this time I should expect director Hippler to flip - flop once again , springing forward to say " That 's what I meant to do all along ! " The scenes depicting animal slaughter are particularly gruesome , and show same as decidedly inhumane , contrary to the intent of Kosher law to prevent animal suffering . I would like for someone who has seen the film , and has some knowledge of these procedures , to comment on whether the portrayal is accurate .
pos	This film plays in the 60s and is about an Italian family : Romano , his wife Rosa and their two children Gigi and Giancarlo emigrate from Solino in Italy to Duisburg in the Ruhr area . I like this film , because I think it is quite realistic : it shows problems which many foreign families have when they come to another country : they have to get used to a new culture , a new environment and this can be difficult : especially if you do n't know the language .... It is difficult for the family but they find a way : they open a restaurant which offers typical Italian food , and it is named " Solino " , like their hometown . The film also shows different conflicts - Gigi and Giancarlo fall in love with the same girl , and although Rosa has to work very hard , Romano refuses to pay money to engage more workers , etc . etc . But stop , I do n't want to tell you how it goes on . You should watch the film yourself , it 's a nice one - I have also made a Referat about it and examined scenes which show different cultural attitudes . And there are a few ...
neg	Normally , I am a pretty generous critic , but in the case of this film I have to say it was incredibly bad . I am stunned by how positive most reviews seem to be . There were some gorgeous shots , but it 's too bad they were wasted on this sinkhole of a movie . It might have worked if " Daggers " was purely an action flick and not a romance , but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle . There is no chemistry between either of the couples , whatever exists between Mei and her men seems to be more lust than love , and for the most part the dialogue is just silly . This may be just a problem with translation , but the frequent usage of the word " flirt " in particular reminded me of 8th grade , not head - over - heels , together forever , worth - dying - for love ; I also felt we were beat over the head with the wind metaphor . The audience is given very little about the characters to really care about , and therefore very little emotional investment in the movie as a whole . I was wishing for a remote control to fast forward , I was slumped in my seat ready to snore , but mostly I just cringed a lot . * * * * * * * spoiler * * * * * Now , the icing on the cake . Or rather , adding insult to injury . The ending was truly one of the most horrible , laughable ones I have ever seen . The boys are having their stag fight and screaming and yelling and hacking at each other . Oh , and then it starts to snow . Randomly . Oh , and then Mei ( dagger embedded in heart ) suddenly pops up out of the weeds . Then she throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach it 's destination , even slowing conveniently midscreen to hit a tiny blood droplet . Wow , cool . Well , then Mei dies finally I guess because she threw the dagger that was lodged in her chest and bled to death . Jin sings , sobs , holds her body close , screen goes blank . I , and the people surrounding me , are chuckling . Not a good sign . Visually stunning , but ultimately a failure .
pos	Loosely intended as a satire of D.W. Griffith 's Intolerance , The Three Ages was Buster Keaton 's first attempt at a full length comedy feature . The only similarities to Intolerance are the opening " book " scene and the fact that similar stories through the ages are edited together into a complete film . Keaton 's reasoning for appropriating this style was that if it did n't succeed as a feature film , it could be reduced to three two - reelers . Fortunately , The Three Ages succeeds brilliantly as a comedy and contains some of the funniest routines I 've seen in any of Keaton 's film . There is nothing unique or daring about the story lines . They are simple boy - meets - girl , boy - loses - girl , boy - gets - girl plots , but the period satires are riotous and set the standard for future works by Mel Brooks and all films of this genre . However , I do n't believe that anyone has ever topped this comedy . No one can play the lovable goof like Keaton and the stunts in this film are some of his best . In addition , Wallace Beery 's appearance as Keaton 's rival adds to this film 's appeal . Anyone who thinks that comedy from the 1920 's can not be appreciated by modern audiences needs to see this movie .
neg	A slow , tedious , and one dimensional movie ! Good casting with clichéd dialogue , boring story line , and soulless direction from Mr Marshal ! The conventional and predictable story of the most famous form of prostitution from the Asian continent , lacks heart , new insights , and depth . The lead character looks out of place due to her tiny phisique and phony looking contact lenses . The lexicon employed by the geishas sounds forced and a bit too sophisticated for their limited exposure in the ways of education . The story goes on and on for hours trying to convince you this little , boring , flat chested Asian girl is the ultimate Geisha , they actually say in the movie " She is destined to become a legend " i say hardy the case ! The movie is just plain boring , it is beautiful to look at , it has a very few interesting moments as many as you may find by going out for cigarretes . Basically , if you do n't believe the messenger you wo nt believe the message , and this girl did n't fill the shoe ! Borin , boring , skip it !
pos	In order to rate this movie fairly you have to think about the genre it 's supposed to be : children 's . They had more guidelines to follow in order to make this movie ( meaning it could not get away with some of the humor and or language from the 1st ) taking all that in this movie was fun and enjoyable to watch . Sequels usually make me nervous , however this one did pretty well for itself . Knowing that it did n't have the star power of Fraiser as George they capitalized on the humor and i believe Showeman did pretty well as the lead . The plot being easy to follow and maybe campy at times fits well for a younger audience , if you want to watch a movie and hope for academy award honors this is not it , but if you want to watch a simple , fun , energy filled movie you would make a good choice with this one .
neg	Relying on the positive reviews above , we saw a free screening of this last night . Now I KNOW that filmmakers plant positive reviews , because there is no way an objective individual could have written these . " Destined to become a ' cult classic ' " ? ? The theater was packed , apparently with friends and families of the production crew , because only a few of us walked out by the first hour . The songs were the most literal I 've ever heard in a musical  " do n't take the short cut , honey , there 's a wolf in the woods .. " . Debi Mazar 's eyes blinked furiously as she struggled to sing . Fortunately , most of the tunes lasted for only a few lines . Now , whoever plays the wolf in this tale should be charming and seductive . Instead , we get Joey Fatone , ex N'Syncer , living up to his last name as he 's not aged well . He 's not exactly lithe with his extra 50 pounds and junior high school - quality makeup and out - of - tune singing . Seriously , this guy was in vocal group ? The rest of the actors are semi - adequate , but ca n't do much about the unimaginative script . You know , it is possible to write for adults and children at the same time  see under " Pixar " . On the positive side , the virtual sets looked nice and were well - integrated with the actors . And it was n't as offensive as " Crash " .
pos	A few summer space campers actually were accidently sent into space by a robot . And the oxygen in ship was running short . They had to sent someone to a space station to get the gas tanks , etc , etc . First of all , this movie 's plot is not possible in real life . But it gives a warm feelings of anything is possible if you set your heart in . It is amazing to see those young actors who still look about the same after so many years . ( I saw this movie for the first time in the year of 2000 , it was filmed in 1986 ) There are quite a few people in that movie who are still working in Hollywood . The view was great from outer space . It does not look unreal . It is about 2 hours long , it runs so fast that you wo n't even notice . You know that it is not real , but you just get sucked into it until the end . Overall , it is a good family movie .
neg	I buy or at least watch every Seagall movie . He came out with a handful of good movies then descending into poor stories , bad camera work and a walk - thru persona , he nearly lost me . A few movies ago he remembered how to make a decent movie . Now he 's forgotten again . This film is seriously dark ( on any level you care to name ) . There is a lot of slash & gash going on here with no discernible purpose unless it 's meant as a warning against the military . Seagall may have had a stand - in for many of his scenes as it was often too dark to tell and someone else 's voice was used most of the time . Sadly the only interesting character was the bad guy who killed his guard to escape custody & then proceeded to raise havoc all over the place . Okay since when do we place an armed guard in the holding room with a prisoner ? Anyway this bad guy was at least colorful , and very focused . There 's lots of gore if you like that king of thing . It looked to me like the bad guys tore the same gash every time . I 'm just glad they did n't suck the blood from their hapless victims . I harken you back to my summary . Basically it is a horror movie disguised as an action film . Dec 6,2006
pos	Obviously , there was n't a huge budget for this film which definitely hindered the production . But the story and ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot . I mean brutal on the level of Ju Dou and other ( great ) Chinese films . I first saw this when I was 14 years old , I ran home and begged God to forgive me for everything ...
neg	when discussing a movie titled ' snakes on a plane ' , we should point out early that the snakes are pretty darn important to the plot . what we have here are very bad cgi snakes that neither look nor move like real snakes . snakes are scary because they appear to be slimy , they crawl they slither . these snakes do nothing of the sort . they glide along like they would in a video game . they are cartoon snakes . i would go as far to say that even someone that had a major phobia against real snakes would not find these ones scary why on earth then would you want to include extreme close ups of these cgi failures ? why not rely on suspense .. the whole ' less is more ' ethic . or better still , why not just make them look good in the first place ? and then maybe still use them sparingly take one look at john carpenters ' the thing ' . here we have real slime , and gore of eerie proportions . 20 years go by and we get this pile of stinking sfx crap ' snakes on a plane ' . when are these people going to wake up and smell the coffee ? special effects are going backwards ! sure you could say .. but the movie is a joke , get it ? sure i 'm with that idea , but do it well ! in addition to the above , this movie has crap dialogue . and the music and sound effects are not creepy or memorable in any way . i could handle every other actor being part of this movie , except for jackson . what was he doing there ? the man who starred in pulp fiction 10 years ago . is this career progression ? are you offering people value for money ? no . i 'd like to know what Tarantino thought when he was half way through this stinker of a movie the current generation seem to have very low expectations . and Hollywood seems to be offering them just what they want . on leaving the cinema i saw a number of advertisements for some truly horrendous looking future releases including ... DOA : dead or alive , ( another ) cgi animal film called ' flushed away ' , and another crap looking comedy named ' click ' . in addition to that i saw some awful trailers , including one for ( another ) crap British horror / comedy . i 've truly not seen the movie industry in a mess like this for a long time expect to see this movie for sale in the DVD bargain section for £ 1 in 6 months time . and if you 're expecting to see a black comedy with tonnes of great looking snakes , and some bad ass cool dialogue coming from samuel l jacksons lips . forget it .
pos	First off , I dislike almost all Neil Simon movies . But there is something about this that is unique , that draws me in , and I would say it is among the most entertaining comedies I have seen . The second time I watched it , the connection was clear . When did Neil Simon meet my grandmothers ?   Ah , afraid they might sue , so he changed them into men . And how dull would it be if they were only housewives , show biz stars is more fun . Well this is a personal review , and my still living grandmother at age 97 ( she even outlived Walter Matthau 's magnificent impersonation of her!)would deny it -- but some of you must find resonance in these characters . Secondly , I have little tolerance for George Burns , but somehow he turned in one of the finest supporting performances I can recall ( and my late grandmother even enjoyed it , although failing to recognize the remarkable similarities she shared with the film character ) . Very ethnic in flavor , and over the top , you will either laugh and laugh or turn this off . For me , the pleasure lingers .
neg	This is not horror , as the first part was : This is ( " campy " ) light and humorous entertainment . Like in so many sequels , the action starts right away with no explanations . But there 's boobs , so I do n't complain . And real boobs that is . If I understand correctly , those are quite rare today amongst the teenage girls in U.S. of A. Which brings to my mind the fact that the main actress here is Pamela " Bruce 's sister " Springsteen . This can not be thought without the first movie , so I compare this to it . Again there is too small clothing ( mainly pants ) and funny hair , it 's not hard to tell what decade this film is made in . Again there is really strange characters , this time even more visibly " pathological " ones . Especially the personnel of the camp . It 's like some mental rehabilitation summer camp . People are older : Most of the actors must be at least 25 , but I think they 're supposed to be 16 or something . Some " methods " used by the Evil Dyke are quite unpleasant . Actually this movie do n't have much in common with the first part , and this is worse than it in every way .
pos	Clever , gritty , witty , fast - paced , sexy , extravagant , sleazy , erotic , heartfelt and corny , Footlight Parade is a first - class entertainment , what the movies are all about . The realistic , satirical treatment gives a fresh edge to the material and its pace and line delivery are breathtaking . To think that they only started making feature talking pictures 7 years before this ! The brilliance of the dialogue can not be matched anywhere today , especially considering that " realism " has taken over and engulfed contemporary cinema . This film was made at a time when the Hayes code restricting content was being ignored and the result is a fresh , self - referential , critical and living cinema that spoke directly to contemporary audiences suffering through the depression and the general angst of the age . I 'd recommend watching any film from this period , that is 1930 - 1935 , for a vision of what popular cinema can potentially be .
neg	This film was bad . Bad acting , bad directing , bad writing . But it was n't bad in a funny way . It was bad in a boring way . I watched " Surface to Air " because I thought it might be a laugh . It was n't . Do n't make the mistake I did . There are plenty of more enjoyable ways to spend an hour and a half such as watching paint dry or reading the dictionary . Seriously .
pos	Bacall does well here - especially considering this is only her 2nd film . This one is often overshadowed because it falls between 2 great successes : " To Have and To Have Not " ( 1944 ) and " The Big Sleep " ( 1945 ) , both of which paired her with Humphrey Bogart . Granted this one is not up to par to the other movies but I think through no fault of her own . I think there was some miscasting in having her portray a British upper - crust lady . No accent whatsoever . I think all the strange accents were distracting - Boyer was certainly no Spaniard . It was hard to keep straight which country people were from . I really liked the black and white cinematography . Mood is used to great affect - I especially liked the fog scene . The lighting also does a great job of adding to the intrigue and tension . Bacall is just gorgeous . Boyer just does n't fit the romantic leading man role for me - so he and Bacall together was a little strange . Not great chemistry - and certainly no Bogie and Bacall magic . But I still really liked this picture . There is great tension and it moves along well enough . I must say I found the murder of the little girl quite bold for this period film . Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre stand out as supporting cast . Paxinou as the hotel keeper is absolutely villainous and evil in her portrayal . Her one scene where she laughs maniacally as Mr. Muckerji is leaving after exposing her as the child 's murderer is quite disturbing . Lorre also does quite well in his slimy , snake portrayal of Conteras - a sleazy coward to the end . Wanda Bendrix also does quite well in portraying the child Else - especially considering this was her first picture and she was only 16 at the time ( though she appears much younger ) . Turns out she later married Auie Murphy which proved to be a short lived , tempestuous marriage .
neg	" Kids Like These " could have been a decent film , given the subject matter . But instead it has become a below - average , run - of - the - mill TV - movie of the week , with not much going for it . The acting is stale , the plot predictable and the direction non - existent . For a better movie on the same subject , try the excellent " Le Huitième Jour " , a film that really cares about the people with Down - syndrome . In " Kids Like These " they are merely used as an excuse for weepy sentimentality . Pretty appalling . 1/10
pos	Somerset Maugham 's characters are brought to life in RKO 's " Of Human Bondage " ; but the movie is a too skeletal version of the novel , with Bette Davis ' star - making performance sucking up all of the energy . Otherwise , it 's the story of Leslie Howard ( as Philip Carey ) ; he dreams of becoming a painter , but is told he has no talent for the arts . As the film progresses , Mr. Howard 's struggles , instead , to become a doctor . His efforts seem to indicate some bad advice regarding the arts ; though successful in medicine , his painting seemed easier - also , note the symbolism of his disability , a " club foot " ( explained in the film ) . Along the way ( right away , in this version ) , Howard becomes infatuated with waitress Davis ( as Mildred Rogers ) . Davis ' characterization of " Mildred " is extraordinary , culminating in a spectacular speech , when she tells Howard , among other things , that she had to " WIPE MY MOUTH ! " after kissing him . Howard also performs well , but the story fails to explain his prolonged fascination and love for Davis ; so , their performances are wasted .   Still , a film to watch for the acting , including some good supporting players . Bette Davis ' characterization was famous for inspiring a " write - in " campaign for the 1934 " Best Actress " Academy Award . For the record , she placed third . The results were :   1 . Claudette Colbert - " It Happened One Night "   2 . Norma Shearer - " The Barretts of Wimpole Street "   3 . Bette Davis - " Of Human Bondage "   4 . Grace Moore - " One Night of Love "   * * * * * * * Of Human Bondage ( 6/28/34 ) John Cromwell ~ Leslie Howard , Bette Davis , Reginald Denny
neg	THE CHOKE ( aka AXE in the UK ) is a slasher produced supposedly as a straight - to - DVD movie . I say " supposedly " because the title of the movie does not have the " V " in brackets to indicate that it was a made for DVD movie ( even though it does have the appearance of one ) . The plot is simple  a band is holding a gig in a former meatpacking factory and they are killed one by one . I think most would agree that the movie was never going to be a masterpiece , but this does not excuse the faults here . Even straight - to - DVD movies such as BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE ( which has a very low IMDb rating ) have a lot of redeeming qualities and sometimes come off as being one of the so - called " so bad , they 're good " movies . However , THE CHOKE falls far short of being either a serious slasher ( such as HALLOWEEN ) or being a " so bad it 's good " movie ( such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE ) . The movie does start off good with a character killed using a drill . The blood effects were very cheesy but understandable given the very low budget . But , from there onwards , it 's downhill all the way . There are so many faults in THE CHOKE that I could spend all day talking about them . But , a few obvious ones stand out and I 'll go into them . The aforementioned gig that the band holds seems to start off with around 50 people present but after the music stops , there seems to be only around 8 people left ( and yet they 're all meant to be locked in ! ) . The characters in this movie are not likable at all . Most of the band members are aggressive foul - mouthed morons or just downright weird . No one really cares about what happens to them , and even their supposed friends forget about them when they 've been dispatched . The highlight of the movie is the presence of a homeless man who seems to regard the meatpacking factory as some kind of church ( seriously ! ) . He spouts some really funny lines for no apparent reason . But sadly , even his presence ca n't save the movie . There are too many scenes of people walking around and talking without any characterisation . Around 65 minutes of the film is spent watching characters walk around talking . Characters disappear for long periods of time without explanation . As in other straight - to - DVD movies such as CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND , the characters spend a lot of time swearing at each other aggressively without any provocation at all . There are plenty of over - the - top outbursts ( mainly from the male characters ) and one nearly results in a full - blown fight . In fact , the format could be said to go as follows : characters walk around -- murder takes place -- characters walk around -- murder takes place . You get the idea . The dialogue is terrible and it seems that few lines are spoken without the f - word being used . Perhaps this was meant to be funny , but it just comes off as sad . And more to the point , we have all seen this done a thousand times before ( usually to much greater effect ) . The movie is totally devoid of any suspense at all . The dead bodies serve to provide the only indication that the characters are in danger . A maniac is running around loose and yet the characters just behave like total morons . They make little attempt to get out of the factory or find a weapon with which to protect themselves . And much of the time , they do n't even pretend to be scared . In the same vein as DRIVE - IN MASSACRE , the killer is not seen at the time the murders are being committed ( with the exception of the final murder when the killer 's identity is revealed ) . A random weapon appears out of nowhere to kill the victim in question . There is no one seen stalking the characters at any time . In DRIVE - IN MASSACRE , this served to make the film funny ( unintentionally of course ) , but here it is not funny at all . And , as another reviewer has pointed out , the soundtrack includes music that is very bad , even for those who like punk rock . The extras look uncomfortable dancing to it . The score ( at the end , there is no music at the beginning ! ) consists of a band of Sugarbabe wannabes singing some very bad song that is completely unrelated to the movie . Do n't misunderstand the points made in this review . This reviewer likes bad movies ( such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE ) as much as the classics ( such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH ) . But , it seems that THE CHOKE tried too hard to fit into one of those categories without fitting into either . And even as straight - to - DVD movies go , this is a poor effort . On a positive note , the film does contain some fairly good gory murder scenes . But , when the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously , these scenes lose their importance quickly as the intensity they provide disappears into oblivion . Fans of the traditional 1980s B - movie slashers should take steps to avoid this movie . And fans of the classics such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH should do everything in their power to avoid it !
pos	Shintarô Katsu , who played the blind swordsman " Zatoichi " in a total of 27 movies , ends the Hanzo trilogy with this excellent film in which he gets to make love to a ghost , Mako Midori ( Blind Beast ) . The big stick , used often in the pursuit of justice , is retired forever . Katsu was his usual impudent self as he pursued those who would steal from the treasury to lend at usurious amounts to those who could not afford to pay . The usual amazing swordplay and skill of the big guy was present , along with the blood . I 'm going to miss him .
neg	The subject matter seems pretty dated today . Adapted for TV from Rona Jaffe 's book ; we trip and stumble through a fantasy existence . Four college students get deeply involved playing a live version of the board game Mazes and Dragons ( based on Dungeons and Dragons ) . One player , a young Tom Hanks , enters the fantasy world too deep . His co - players must come to his rescue and save him from self inflicted harm . David Wallace , Wendy Crewson and Chris Makepeace round out the game 's foursome . Support cast is made up of veteran actors like Murray Hamilton , Vera Miles , Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg . At this date , it seems lumbering and tame . But the highlight of watching is seeing Tom Hanks between his " Bosom Buddies " salad days and his big splash in SPLASH on the silver screen . The youngest of viewer will get most enjoyment .
pos	I am amazed that movies like this can still be made . I watch all kinds of movies all the time with my friends and i can say that this is one of the best i ever seen . Never thinked that a movie of 146 minutes can make me think about it on and on . Washington , charismatic and intense as ever , plays Creasy , a washed - up ex - counter - terrorist agent who 's taken to the bottle . Once he 's assigned to protect young Pita ( Dakota Fanning ) in Mexico City , his emotional and redemptive arc is jump - started in the way only an adorable little girl can provide . Inevitably , Pita is kidnapped by thugs , and Creasy decides that most of Mexico City must pay the price for daring to take away his character 's teddy - bear - clutching catalyst . Yes , he has become ... a Man on Fire .   You must see this movie .
neg	I 've had to change my view on the worst film in the world having just seen this one . THIS IS IT ! Make no mistake this film is awful . Here 's a list of reasons : Hopeless storyline ( despite being based on a true story ) . Dreadful acting ( what was Judge Reinhold thinking ) Unbelieveably bad stunts . Childish dialogue . Non - existent continuity . Lack of atmosphere . Get the picture ?
pos	This show was appreciated by critics and those who realized that any similarities between " Pushing Daisies " style and anyone else 's was not a steal . ( Yes , I 've seen " Amelie . " " Pushing Daisies " is somewhat similar but still different enough to be original . ) Rather , there are too few shows on TV that have this kind of quirky charm . The greatest similarity is to " Dead Like Me " but " P.D " comes by that similarity honestly : Bryan Fuller created both shows . ( Both shows involve an " undead " young woman , For example . ) This show never stopped being funny and charming , and it was always odd , yet was consistently humane . I must say a word about the conventions of on - going story lines . some people have complained that this show lacked a moral center because in the first ( and several subsequent ) episodes Ned seems to get away with causing the death of Chuck 's father without consequences of any kind . First of all , this must be a new definition of " without consequences of any kind " because , in spite of the fact that Ned was only a boy and did not realize that he had caused the death of Chuck 's father , he nevertheless felt guilty from the moment he realized what he had done . Further , about a dozen episodes into the series , Ned finally did confess to Chuck that he had caused her father 's death with his gift . Now , there are no police to charge people with magically causing one person 's death by bringing another person back to life , so the questions of absolution and restitution have to be taken up without societal guidance . In other words , it 's between Ned and Chuck , who was not inclined to forgive Ned anytime soon . But this does point out a problem with continuing story lines in network dramas . I remember when David Caruso 's character on " NYPD Blue " did something wrong and it seemed he got away with it -- for a whole year -- then he got caught and was forced to resign from the job ( and left the show ) . The point is , viewers should learn by now and not assume that just because a regular character does something wrong in a single episode , and is not caught in that episode , that he has gotten away with it . There is always next week -- and maybe even next year .
neg	REALLY ? ? ?   I am truly amazed to see the glowing reviews here !   This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen . It is one big pathetic , grainy , cliché . I would have laughed out loud , and a lot , but was on a date with an ex - military guy . I could not hide my other response , BOREDOM . Yes , I think my date , a flat - line " good old boy " , liked it . That 's not a compliment . I know an actor wants to work .... Fine for the others . But Ralph , come on . It was a painful tease from Ralph . I vote a 2 only because Ralph looked SO STUNNING . But I must plead , Ralph , how could you ? And , why ? ?   I 'm going to go watch The End of The Affair to heal and recover now .... C1
pos	WHEN FRIENDSHIP KILLS , in my opinion , is a very touching and kind of heartbreaking drama about the consequences of being anorexic or bulimic . Anytime Lexi ( Katie Wright ) or Jennifer ( Marley Shelton ) threw up , I wanted to vomit myself . It 's kind of hard to explain why . If you ask me , they should have been more cooperative about things . However , I did enjoy seeing them do things together as well as get lectured by their parents . Before I wrap this up , I 'd like to say , " If you ask me , WHEN FRIENDSHIP KILLS does indeed show you how being anorexic or bulimic can affect a person 's body . " Now , in conclusion , I recommend this movie to everyone who has n't seen it . You 're in for some tears and a good time , so the next time it 's on TV , kick back with a friend and watch it .
neg	Given the chance to write , direct and star in my own movie , I would probably choose something about robot women with guns . Anthony Hopkins , however , decided to make possibly the strangest movie anyone has ever seen . " Slipstream " is a movie that is so strange that even David Lynch would probably look at the person next to him and say ' What 's going on ? ' . This is a movie where , in one scene , a man crosses the road towards a yellow car facing to the right which suddenly changes into a pink car facing to the left . This is a movie where two characters have a conversation interspersed with shots of random people laughing and insects climbing up walls . This is a movie where a man starts talking about " Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers " only for the actor of that particular movie to suddenly show up as himself ( and then disappear into thin air ) .   This is a movie that decides to throw the need for a coherent plot straight out of the window and use fifteen different edits whilst doing so , as well as changing from black and white to colour for seemingly no reason at all . I must , however , commend Mr Hopkins for his choice of actors in this movie ( some of whom portray multiple characters ) . All of those involved throw themselves into their roles , even if they probably have no idea what they 're actually doing . My favourite here was Christian Slater 's thug in a hat who was impressively menacing whilst babbling nonsense and singing the American national anthem .   Anthony Hopkins has been quoted saying that he did this movie as a joke and that 's possibly the best way to sum up " Slipstream " . It 's a joke on the audience . You 'll watch it from beginning to end , trying to understand what is going on and hoping that the answer will come , only to discover that the answer never actually does . What the punchline to this particular joke is , only Anthony Hopkins will ever know . I mentioned David Lynch earlier and I 'm a big fan of that particular director . I would guess that Anthony Hopkins shares my love for the likes of " Twin Peaks " , " Blue Velvet " and " Lost Highway " . However , " Slipstream " is n't as satisfying as any of the movies of Lynch despite imitating many of his techniques ( although I was surprised to discover that nobody talks backwards in " Slipstream " ) . It 's far too chaotic and random - as another reviewer here pointed out , it 's the movie version of Alzheimer 's disease . No doubt there are a small number out there who are able to watch this and draw something from it . Unfortunately for the rest of us , " Slipstream " quickly becomes an annoying and confusing experience that was only made due to Hopkins ' involvement . Watch at your own risk .
pos	Preston Waters is off to a bad summer . Besides his birthday coming up , nothing else looks promising . First he has to share his own room with his brothers who are going to run a business . They ca n't do it in their rooms because they do n't have enough space . Off to a birthday party he only gets $ 6 tokens while others get $ 32 , $ 35 , and even $ 50 . When one of his birthday cards comes early , he only gets a check made out for $ 11 . Going to the bank he learns he needs $ 200 at least to start an account . Leaving the bank , a bully steals the check . Pursuing after the kid nearly gets him run over ( definately his bike gets ruined ) by a criminal named Quigley ( played by Miguel Ferrer ) . Quigley 's just come from the bank too from giving the owner $ 1,000,000 to give to this guy tomorrow . Quigley starts to write a check for the damage , but only succeeds in writing his name before a police car circles the area . Afraid , he gives Preston the check , informs him to give it to his dad to finish out . That evening though , Preston tells his dad that he does n't want a new bike , he wants his own room back , better yet his own house . His father confines him to his room for the rest of the evening . Moping in his room Preston figures things ca n't get any worse he realizes that he forgot about the check as it 's still in his shirt pocket . It 's blank . Using the computer and after careful consideration , he makes it out for $ 1,000,000 . The next day , while trying to cash it at the bank he 's taken to the owner who thinks he 's the person he 's supposed to give the $ 1,000,000 and does . He 's not though as the real person named Juice comes in a moment later . Now the three have to track Preston down . Meanwhile , Preston has fun buying all sorts of stuff including his own house and even going on dates with a disguised bank lady who 's really and FBI agent ( who 's trying to track the 3 bad guys down ) . He makes this person up named Mr. Macintosh who he works for and even plans a party for him on his birthday . But eventually things catch up ( the money runs out , the bad guys get him ) . Overall , a pretty funny flick . Miguel Ferrer plays his role very good . If you enjoyed him in Another Stakeout , you 'll love him here . He does all sorts of wicked crazy things . Rick Ducommun ( the stressed out boss from Ghost in the Machine ) plays a wonderful friendly chauffeur in this movie .
neg	Let me start off by saying that this does n't seem or feel like a movie . It seems like just another TV show about popular girls and boys with no real film language top back it up . The camera angles are so straight forward that the story is told the simplest way possible never making the public connect with it . This film takes us to where no movie I 've seen has done before : to a realm where the Film Theater becomes a warm medium giving the public every element of interpretation . Too obvious . The large movie screen is only used as an enlarged TV from where we can see every attribute of these women in a larger than life manner . Lately it seems that young directors are compromising the Art of film making for sales . This is very scary . The industry is spoiling the art in movies . We must educate ourselves and our children about what cinematography and its language are really about . Not just sales and entertainment , but a way to communicate feelings , passions and even culture . Not as a launching platform for young divas and jocks .
pos	How powerful and captivating simple quality filmmaking can be . This film tells it 's tale with everyday scenes that manage to revel the poignancy hidden within . It 's true as others have stated , how this film really makes it glaringly obvious how lost Hollywood is in it 's special effects , overblown emotionalism and over the top climatic endings and have forgotten the essence of a meaningful story told with simple realism . So much of what these characters are going through is implied by the scene rather than spelled out in wordy dialogue . One aspect that I really enjoyed about the film was the contrast of the two brothers , one so very openly expressive in his childlike way and the other completely stoic but both able to evoke deep emotion . The older brother needed to say little , as he usually did , it was all there in that deadpan face of his ! Beautiful cinematography , wonderful acting , great direction ! Not to be missed !
neg	The basic formula for the original series was ; take someone , get the audience to like them , then put them into Mortal danger . This formula worked for the 32 episodes made between 1964 - 68 .   Now , we jump forward 40 years to 2004 .. We are introduced to Alan Tracy , a somewhat less - than - diligent college school kid , with his friend , Fermat , a young know - it - all . They are whisked off by Lady Penelope in her pink Ford Thunderbird to the island paradise where the Tracy Family live , for the school holidays . Almost immediately , they are left in the care of Kyrano and his daughter , Tin - Tin whilst the adults go to rescue John from Thunderbird 5 which has been damaged by a staged accident . This is all part of The Hood 's scheme to take over Tracy Island so that he can steal the Thunderbird machines ...  To rob a bank ! Yes . The plot IS as limp as that ! The dialogue is banal , the acting more wooden than that of the ( fibreglass ) puppets , the effects , anything but special and Hans Zimmer 's score  ? What little there was of Barry Gray 's glorious theme shone through Zimmer 's lackluster orchestration . The rest of the score was eminently forgettable . In fact , part of the score was broadcast the following week on the radio and did n't recognise it ! I did n't even bother to stay to witness Busted 's mediocre efforts with the end titles To be fair , Ron Cook worked quite well as Parker , he and Sophia Myles as Penelope seemed wasted . With the right material , they could have been show stoppers . The CGI work was what I would have called leading edge - 5 years ago . The Dynamics of the main craft were just wrong ; The original series models at least moved as if they had mass Another sore point is that the whole production seemed to be one long set of product placements , from every vehicle being built by Ford to the entire content of the Tracy Freezer being produced by Ben & Jerry 's . My son ( 9 ) enjoyed the film but this cross between Spy Kids and ' Clockstoppers ' , aimed squarely at his age group , added nothing to the Thunderbirds legend . When Star Trek hit the big screen in 1979 with ' The Motion Picture ' , a whole new lease of life was breathed into the franchise which then continued for another 20 years or so . With this film , Frakes has missed a golden opportunity to do the same with the Thunderbirds franchise . I predict that this film , like ' The Avengers ' and ' the Saint ' before it , will sink into obscurity within 6 months , leaving the original series to its ' classic ' status .
pos	Having seen Charley Boorman in Long Way Round with Ewan McGregor , I was very interested to see how Charley would be in his own show . I thought Charley came across as a lovely guy who is very grounded and down to earth . Its nice to see that celebrities struggle with their weight and fitness , it just show 's their human too ! I do n't know a lot about bikes , but this show gripped me right from the start . The preparation and organising for this event seems immense . The event itself seems very dangerous and I 'm fascinated to see why Charley and everyone else is doing it and how far he gets . I love the pace of the show and the fast upbeat music . I ca n't believe he broke his collar bone , I really hope its not the end , I ca nt wait to see the next episode ...
neg	I 'm a Christian who generally believes in the theology taught in Left Behind . That being said , I think Left Behind is one of the worst films I 've seen in some time . To have a good movie , you need to have a well - written screenplay . Left Behind fell woefully short on this . For one thing , it radically deviates from the book . Sometimes this is done to condense a 400-page novel down to a two - hour film , but in this film I saw changes that made no sense whatsoever . Another thing , there is zero character development . When characters in the story get saved ( I wo n't say who ) , the book makes it clear that it 's a long , soul - searching process . In the film it 's quick and artificial . The book is written decently enough where people like Rayford Steele , Buck Williams and Hattie Durham seem real , but in the movie scenarios are consistently given the quick treatment without anything substantial . In another scene where one character gets angry about being left behind ( again , I wo n't say who ) , it seems artificial . I realize as a Christian it 's unedifying for me to say I disliked this film , but I ca n't in a good conscience recommend a film that I feel was horribly done . Perhaps it would 've been better to make the first book into 2 - 3 films . Either way , Christians need to realize that to be taken seriously as filmmakers , we need to start by putting together a film in a quality way . I realize a lot of effort probably went into Left Behind , but that 's the way I see it .
pos	This movie is just so good ! Despite Carmen Electra , this has to be one of the better films I have seen in awhile . Jamie Kennedy is just amazing , and Loren Dean plays an insane spoiled movie star very well . The plot is great as well . It 's all very real which is scary . It says here that it 's a drama , but this is one of the damn funniest dramas I have ever seen . Go check it out .
neg	Not a movie , but a lip synched collection of performances from acts that were part of the British Invasion , that followed the dynamic entrance of the Beatles to the music world . Some of these acts did not make a big splash on this side of the pond , but a lot of them did . Featured are : Herman 's Hermits , Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas , Peter and Gordon , Honeycombs , Nashville Teens , Animals , and of course , the Beatles . It is so much fun watching these young acts before they honed and polished their acts .
pos	I have to say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel " Jane Eyre " . Both Dalton and Clarke are very believable as Rochester and Jane . I 've seen other versions , but none compare to this one . The best one for me . I could never imagine anyone else playing these characters ever again . The last time I saw this one was in 1984 when I was only 13 . At that time , I was a bookworm and I had just read Charlotte Bronte 's novel . I was completely enchanted by this miniseries and I remember not missing any of the episodes . I 'd like to see it again because it 's so good . :-)
neg	The book is so good that at least the opening of this made - for - tv movie will move you , but then , as it diverges more and more from the book , taking out all the religion and love and mathematics and putting in cotton candy cliches , it becomes boring . Still , from comments I 've heard , people who have not read the book tend to like it , and if it leads even on child to read A Wrinkle in Time , it will have served its purpose . The most embarrassing change is to make the Happy Medium a clone of Mary Poppins ' Uncle Albert ( I love to Laugh ) . Nothing is quite so squirm inducing as characters on the screen laughing hilariously at things that are totally unfunny .
pos	I never thought an old cartoon would bring tears to my eyes ! When I first purchased Casper & Friends : Spooking About Africa , I so much wanted to see the very first Casper cartoon entitled The Friendly Ghost ( 1945 ) , But when I saw the next cartoon , There 's Good Boos To - Night ( 1948 ) , It made me break down ! I could n't believe how sad and tragic it was after seeing Casper 's fox get killed ! I never saw anything like that in the other Casper cartoons ! This is the saddest one of all ! It was so depressing , I just could n't watch it again . It 's just like seeing Lassie die at the end of a movie . I know it 's a classic , But it 's too much for us old cartoon fans to handle like me ! If I wanted to watch something old and classic , I rather watch something happy and funny ! But when I think about this Casper cartoon , I think about my cats !
neg	I suppose it was for Temple Matthews who written basically a remake even though there are few changes which just make it worse . SPOILERS : It is much similar to the original . Melody , Ariel 's new daughter is threatened by Ursula 's sister , Morgana . Morgana escapes , but keeps her promise to take Melody away from them . Did Ursula have a sister ? ! And she is not that great a villain as Ursula was . This is where there is similarity . Medoly is kept from the sea until Morgana is captured , but she does n't know a thing about it , because it all happened when she was a baby . A wall surrounds the palace to keep her in and morgana out . She goes under the wall day to day to have a swim and talk with Sebastian , who is not as funny or fun as in the original . She finds a seashell with her name on it and runs away from home and to look for answers and finds Morgana . Here is a similarity ; Morgana tricks Melody , making her happy by turning here into a mermaid . Meanwhile , Eric , Melody and King Triton look for her . To stay a mermaid she needs to steal the trident from Triton . So Melody does , because she does not know King Triton is her father . She makes friends with a penguin and a walrus and here is where it is awful . The penguins who live with them in an icy ocean , hate them because they are cowards . So they try to prove they are heroes and fail . That does not suit the little mermaid . And the dialogue during those conversations between the penguins and those two characters is ear - bleeding . you know why ? Because the first had a great story . This one is not and is not magical . It is just an example of how bad many sequels are . Melody finds them and they help to take her to Atlantica to prove themselves . When they take the trident , Ariel finds Melody with Morgana . Melody is angry at her mother for keeping her from the sea so she gives the trident to Morgana , then she shows her true colours once she grabs it . Poor Ariel and Melody are in her custody . The penguin and the walrus begin to prove themselves when they fight Morgana 's shark friend . Sorry I did not mention him earlier . They finally prove themselves . Eric , King Triton and his soldiers arrive but are forced to bow down before Morgana by the power of the trident . Melody takes it , throws it to Triton and he ices Morgana ( literally ) . Then Ariel apologises to Melody and thinks it is all her fault . It was not ! Ariel did the right thing to protect Melody , but they never say so . Triton offers Melody to live in sea or land . She in fact has a " better idea " . She uses the trident to vaporize the wall so humans and mer - folk can be together . Then everyone sings an awful song . THE END . Whoever has seen it and likes this obviously has not seen the original . I do not dislike this because I am a teenager . I liked it when I was very very little . Then as I grew older I began to see what is bad about this film . young , young kids will enjoy it , but it is likely that when they are in primary school , they will forget about it . Normally I would think I over - judged a film and it was better than I remember when I watched it again , but not this one . It is even worse . Story is no exception . If you thought , by reading this that the story is good , read more of this comment and you will know the other bad points : Well , you know the story now . I am sorry for spoiling it for you , but I had to point out some bad parts of it . One of the worst things is the animation . Colour is awful . The original had beautiful colour . Watching this almost made me want to go blind . Even the illustrations and landscape design were not good . The original had beautiful , magical colouring and beautiful underwater landscape design and for land as well , making it a joy to watch . The music is unbearable . Compared to the first , the music here is crap . Songs are not that well composed and Tara Strong ( I think that is her name ) who did Melody can not sing . She at times either sang too high or did not keep track for the melody in the song . So much for having " Melody " as a name . And the music is not at all beautiful or moving . Little Mermaid 1 won an Oscar for it and it truly deserved it . This one deserved a razzie award for worst musical score in a sequel if it would exist . I did not like the voices . Several people who played characters from the first , did the same ones in this . Jodi Benson is a great singer , but now that she is older , no offence to her , her voice is too deep and not so beautiful anymore . And I am really disappointed in her and others who were in the first for being a part of this . If I was chosen for this film , just by reading the script , I can tell it would be a bad film . The characters are different now . Ariel is more wiser now , but annoying . They overdid her character , making her too mature . In sequels you are not meant to change the characters unless it is for a special reason . She was sixteen in the first . There is little chance she changes . That is the stage when you become the person you are going to be for the rest of your life . Screenwriters should think of that . They should think of the character . Well , I suppose that is it for me . I hope you find my comment useful , because I am sure a lot of you will agree with my point of view .
pos	This was the funniest piece of film / tape I have ever witnessed , bar none . I laughed myself sick the first three times I watched it . I recommend it to everyone , with the warning that if they ca n't handle the f - sharps to stay FAR away . At his best when telling stories from a kids point of view .
neg	Susan Seidelman seems to have had a decent career with a few top notch credits under her belt . I 'm certainly glad she bounced back from this film which seems to have its admirers . I 'm not one of them . I 've seen better acting in high school plays than I did in Smithereens . The plot such as it is involved young Susan Berman who is ambitious to make it in the world of music and is willing to do just about anything to get there . She even rejects the sincere advances of a young artist who is living out of his van off the East River played by Brad Rijn . Young Mr. Rijn contributes the worst performance in the film , in fact one of the worst acting jobs I 've seen in a long time . No wonder he 's not gone anywhere . I will say that Seidelman 's eye for the camera is a good one in capturing the familiar East Village locations where the film was mostly shot . But her work with her live performers did n't measure up . I 'm not sure she had that much raw material to work with . Look fast and you 'll see a very young Christopher Noth before Law and Order and Sex in the City as a street hustler . If you like punk rock , you might sit through this for the soundtrack . I 'll stick to Bing Crosby .
pos	This is one of the best Jodie Foster movies out there and largely ignored due to the general public 's misconception of it as a teen flick . It has wonderful performances , particularly a fight scene between Jodie and her mother , played by a convincing Sally Kellerman . The three girls that play Jodie 's friends are somewhat amateurish but I do think it is worth seeing .
neg	This movie makes Peter an elf in Robin Hood costume instead of a human boy in probably - not - Robin - Hood - costume and ignores all the persona features in him that really matter . This movie makes Wendy a babbling idiot . And poor Captain Hook a TOTAL clown . And of course as every Disney cartoon must have a character which has had too many hits in the head , they made one of the Lost Boys that one . The only character that has not been disgraced in this film is Tink . The only star is for her . The story itself then ? The Darling parents do n't even get the time to notice their kids are gone ! ! ! Probably one of the most significant point in the original story and they ruined it ! Also the famous nursery scene between Peter Pan and Wendy is a stunning piece of- There are no thimbles and no acorns - one of the little things that makes the original story such a unique one . It 's a wonder he even had lost his shadow and she helped him stick it . ( Even though to his shoes and it makes no sense to me . ) Ruining a great story like this just to amuse children should be illegal . So know now if you have n't known it before - this Disney version does not have anything significant in common with the original story - which is not really a children 's story but just a great , great story . This just annoys me to no end .
pos	The film begins with a bunch of kids in reform school and focuses on a kid named ' Gabe ' , who has apparently worked hard to earn his parole . Gabe and his sister move to a new neighborhood to make a fresh start and soon Gabe meets up with the Dead End Kids . The Kids in this film are little punks , but they are much less antisocial than they 'd been in other previous films and down deep , they are well - meaning punks . However , in this neighborhood there are also some criminals who are perpetrating insurance fraud through arson and see Gabe as a convenient scapegoat -- after all , he 'd been to reform school and no one would believe he was innocent once he was framed . So , when Gabe is about ready to be sent back to " The Big House " , it 's up to the rest of the gang to save him and expose the real crooks . The " Dead End Kids " appeared in several Warner Brothers films in the late 1930s and the films were generally very good ( particularly ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES ) . However , after the boys ' contracts expired , they went on to Monogram Studios and the films , to put it charitably , were very weak and formulaic -- with Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey being pretty much the whole show and the group being renamed " The Bowery Boys " . Because ANGELS WASH THEIR FACES had the excellent writing and production values AND Hall and Gorcey were not constantly mugging for the camera , it 's a pretty good film -- and almost earns a score of 7 ( it 's REAL close ) . In fact , while this is n't a great film aesthetically , it 's sure a lot of fun to watch , so I will give it a 7 ! Sure , it was a tad hokey - particularly towards the end when the kids take the law into their own hands and Reagan ignores the Bill of Rights -- but it was also quite entertaining . The Dead End Kids are doing their best performances and Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan provided excellent support . Sure , this part of the film was illogical and impossible but somehow it was still funny and rather charming -- so if you can suspend disbelief , it works well .
neg	I must admit that I have been a sucker for Samurai flicks since I can remember . I used to watch rather indiscriminate , be it " elitist " works like The Seven Samurai or the bloody comic - book variation like Lone Wolf and Cub . I also liked US-/Japanese " Crossovers " like The Bushido Blade . And of course everything containing Sonny Chiba and Hiroyuki Sanada . And I 've virtually watched every Samurai at least twice . But not Kabuto . In 1993 I first watched Kabuto on video , that even Samurai films can be boring . In the beginning I was looking forward to Mayeda reaching Europe and the confrontations that would come from that but by the time he actually reached Spain , I really did n't care so much for the movie anymore . It would n't do the film justice to call it " bad " . Technically it 's a clean entry into the genre . But there is simply never quiet enough . Sho Kosugi has limited skills as both director and actor and has only a fraction of above mentioned Japanese actors charisma . And speaking of Sho Kosugis son Kane , who appears in almost all Sho Kosugi films as Shos son : he has inherited little - to - none of his fathers limited acting skills . Adding to the minus - points is the absence of the blood and gore that until then was a trademark of all Samurai film . This was obviously intended for a younger US- / European audience . Lets just say that it 's a so - so film for the average historic - action - adventure fan but a bore for hardened fans of Samurai cinema . Fans who are into the " Samurai meets  " -genre , should rather go and watch Red Sun ( 1971 ) , featuring Charles Bronson as cowboy who has to team up with Samurai Toshiro Mifume to retrieve a samurai sword from bad - guy Alan Delon . It pretty much how to do it right and where Kabuto went wrong . So , even though the film is a mere 100 minutes , it seems like a much longer film . The reason I gave this a honourable 4/10 points instead of 3/10 : First time I saw this film , I saw it in the German synchronized version . In this version , Kosugi can actually be understood . I must admit that his ' Engrish ' is at times funny but gets tiresome after about 30 minutes .
pos	I love this film . It 's one of those I can watch again and again . It is acted well by a good cast that does n't try too hard to be star studded . The premise of a newly widowed housewife who turns to selling pot to make ends meet could have been made into an Americanised turd of a movie or an action thriller . Either would have killed the film completely . The film plays out like an Ealing Comedy with a terrific feel - good factor throughout . It is worth watching just for the scene with the two old ladies and a box of cornflakes ... ( no that 's not a spoiler ! )
neg	1st watched 2/2/2003 - 4 out of 10(Dir - Jim Kammerud & Brian Smith ) : Drab and un - spectacular supposed sequel to the original classic animated ` 101 Dalmatians . ' Yes , the movie continues where it ended in the first one , but the problem is that it plays out much like the original . One of the great things about the original was the pacing of the story , which this one does n't have . The animation is also very un - spectacular for Disney and all we get is the same characters going thru the same kind of story all over again . When is Disney going to stop boring us with sequels and re - do 's etc .. etc . Probably when we stop renting or buying this mediocre fare that they have put out .
pos	The ultimate homage to a great film actress . The film is a masterpiece of poetry on the screen . Like great poetry it is timeless . Direction , cast , screenplay , music , lyrics , in fact all the norms for movie - making are perfectly chosen to suit the message of the film . The Muslim society in India has never been presented with such respect , nobility and reality . The script is memorable in the hands of Meena , Ashok , Raaj Kumar , Nadira etc to name a few . Personally i was most impressed by the regal looking Kamal Kapoor . The master movie maker Kamal Amrohi 's lasting legacy to the sub - continent . A very beautiful film on a controversial theme that makes humanity look up and face the reality of the outcasts in the world.'In ka naam ? Pakeeza ! haan Pakeza'.Such acting is unheard of in this age of sex , dance and pornography .
neg	Creepshow 2 had a lot of potential , they just did n't put enough time in perfecting it . The stories were pretty cool and creepy enough , but it was lacking . It 's a good movie , but after you 've seen it once , you might want to see it again . This movie could of been better .
pos	This movie has it all . It is a classic depiction of the events that surrounded the migration of thousands of Cuban refugees . Antonio Montana(played by Al Pacino ) , is just one of the thousands to get a chance to choose his destiny in America . This cinematic yet extremely accurate depiction of Miamis ' Drug Empire is astonishing . Brian DePalma does an amazing job directing this picture , so much that , the viewer becomes involved with both the storyline , as well as every character in the cast . With Tony 's characters ' pressence being so believable and strong , Brian DePalma brang out the raw talent exposed by Steven Bauer(Manny , Tony 's best Friend ) , Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio(Gina , Tony 's Sister ) , Robert Loggia(Frank , Tony 's Boss)and Michelle Pfeiffer(Elvira , Frank 's Wife ) . I enjoyed every minute watching this movie , and still watch it on a weekly basis . On this year , the 20th Anniversary of this classic crime movie , I for one am a true believer that in another 20 years people will still refer to this movie in astonishing numbers . With other crime movies being so dramatic I find , this movie is a shock to the system .
neg	I wo n't spend a lot of time nor energy on this comment . I just want to add it because all the comments were so positive I felt like I just had to let people know that not everyone is so thrilled , let alone intellectually provoked by this attempt at creating a captivating philosophical cinematic enigma . Some scenes seemed promising , playing with visual dimensions , but could n't hold up the rest . I felt like I was stoned for the first time again , having semi - philosophical conversations with fellow adolescents . What a futile attempt to raise Dutch cinema to new heights . I 'd rather watch Jesus is een Palestijn , without all the pretentions and with straight forward humor , also raising questions about life and the realities we create for ourselves . Gert de Graff is not Jean - Luc Godard or Tarkovsky and appearantly never will be .
pos	I 've always liked Johnny Concho and I wish this film were out on VHS and DVD . Frank Sinatra gives one of the most unusual performances in his career in this one . When we first meet Frank in the film 's title role , he 's the brother of a notorious gunfighter who 's out of town at the moment . The brother strikes terror in the heart 's of the town and Frank takes full advantage of that to bully the townspeople safe and secure in his shadow . Only Phyllis Kirk has any feeling for him . She 's the daughter of storekeeper Wallace Ford and Dorothy Adams . Two other gunmen arrive William Conrad and Christopher Dark and it turns out Conrad has killed Sinatra 's brother and he 's coming to his town to take over . They humiliate Sinatra and run him out of town . Kirk follows him . Overnight Sinatra turns from punk into coward and becomes a man searching for some kind of backbone . It 's a well acted performance , almost as good as his Oscar nominated role in The Man With a Golden Arm . Pity for some reason this has not been seen for years . Two other performances of note are Keenan Wynn as former gunfighter turned preacher who helps Sinatra find what he needs to stand up to Conrad and Dark . And then there is Conrad in what I believe was his career role on screen . He 's a villain of incredible malevolence , pure evil incarnate walking and talking on the silver screen . However what I like about Johnny Concho is the climax an unforgettable one where Conrad and Dark are dealt with . Let 's just say I believe Johnny Concho was MGM 's answer to High Noon and a primer for what you do when evil causes a break down in all law and order .
neg	you can be fooled by your first impressions . as in , initial reactions to a movie , for example . as in , the first time i saw this movie i was bedazzled by the idea of it ( first of all , i love black comedies ) . could even - despite being male , myself - empathise with the feisty girls ' fervor to see their husbands deceased without delay . was tripped up by my own face - value ( and , i do mean " face - value " ) response to nicolette sheridan and a couple of the other delicious dames in the picture . it just goes to show you that you 've got ta step back from a situation sometimes and see that it 's bad ( and not " bad good , " either ) : the reason i 'm giving this movie a " 4 " rating is because of ms sheridan and her gams ( the rest of ' er is pretty good , too ) ; but this movie has all the hallmark TV movie characteristics - which means you 'll be disappointed if your a lover of movies made for the big screen . the story contains plot holes you could run a tunnel through - and i 'll generally overlook holes in a plot if the overall thing does it for me ; and i just experienced an incredible letdown the second time i saw it . i do n't think it 's a total waste of time , but ....
pos	I spied this short on a DVD of best new Zealand shorts , all great but The french Doors was amazing . It starts off slow and you wonder if there is anything going to happen . Just as you relax into the hum drum of home renovation , the most spookiest thing happens .   EEEEkkk , I wanted to stop watching , but I was glued .   The films dips into the primal fear of the dark and with little , if not any , special effects . It chills you right to the bone . A simple yet brilliant concept opened up all those memories of when I was young and dream't up the most improbably but spooky situations .   The film makers visual style are bang on and the lead character takes you convincingly through the story . It is a quality short that I have n't seen in quite some time .   The French Doors has all the hallmarks of a great feature , alas it finishes after ten minutes or so . Never the less a great ending that begs you to want to know more .   Loved it and well done and thanks for the ride . These New Zealanders are really turning out the talent . A new fan .
neg	This is another of the many B minus movies tagged as film noir in the hope of generating some interest in something that is devoid of it . All aspects of the film - script , acting , direction - are mediocre . The acting by the three leads is wooden . I guess John Dall was expected to go places in the movie business but then someone realised he had little talent and therefore ended up doing TV work . Lee J Cobb who is usually terrific can not rise above the poor script and poor direction . Jane Wyatt is supposed to be a femme fatale but comes nowhere near convincing the viewers . The movie does have two of the strangest looking cars that I have ever seen , the one in which John Dall goes after Lee J Cobb is particularly strange . The DVD transfer is typical Alpha .
pos	Is this your typical women in chains navy transport love story ? Maybe , hell , you know how the formula works by now , pretty woman is introduced in to a picture , someone has to fall in love with her . I think this film does follow some typical story lines , but that does n't say anything about the content . There are great scenes with Crispen Glover , Dennis Hopper , and Gary Busey , although short . Some things did n't make sense , such as the need to get in to random fights , but it is entertaining to watch , the fights were actually well done . This is definitely a comedy foremost , but it does have a lot of good feel to it . The humor is well balanced , you wo n't hurt your stomach on this , but you will keep a smile . There is a little bit of steamy action , so not one for the kids .
neg	She may have an Oscar and a Golden Globe , but this film shows why she also is a perennial Razzie nominee . To do a film that is so bad must be an indication that she needs money . She could do ads on why you should n't talk on a cell phone while driving , especially at night on the way to a crowded mall . Susan Montford should stick to producing ( Shoot ' Em Up ) as she is not very good as a writer / director . She is accosted by four thugs in the mall parking lot , and the first thing they do is tell her they have a gun . What does she do ? She starts pushing and cursing them like she knows martial arts or something . She manages to get away , but gets lost in the forest after crashing . Why did n't she run to someones house ? We get four thugs with guns chasing a lady with a toolbox . Of course , their guns are no match for her wrench . Ha ! Of course , she also has a tire iron and a screwdriver . Those poor thugs . Now , she 's home for Christmas - and she brought a gun !
pos	Daniel Day - Lewis is the most versatile actor alive . English aristocratic snob in A Room With a View , passionate Irish thief in In the Name of the Father , an impudent , violent butcher in Gangs of New York ( in a performance ten times stronger than Adrian Brody 's in the Pianist ) and as the outrageous Cristy Brown with cerebral palsy in My Left Foot ( just to name a few ) . His roles all influence eachother , but each is seperate , and utterly unique . He changes completely , with each character he takes on . And I 'm beginning to believe that he can act as anything . Anything . As Cristy Brown he is stunning . He does not ridicule the character , and he does not pity the character . A difficult achievement . And Cristy Brown comes to life . A smart man . An outrageous man . Human . This movie , despite small scene - transition faults and the like , is an inspiration . Yes , it 's predictable . But is it stupidly sentimental ? No . I laughed . I cried . Not a single moment of cheese . Proof that this is n't a Hollywood movie . My favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant , when Cristy is discussing painters with Eileen , Peter and her friends . Here 's where Daniel Day - Lewis reaches an acting climax . " I 'll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that 's animated . " " Wheel out the cripple ! " And his performance never slows down , never falters , and is beautiful . Simply . He has a lot of screen time here . I watch it again again , and I never get tired of Cristy 's perspicacious eyes , twitching and guttural speeches . A must - see . Fo sho , yo !
neg	I watched this movie last night and already I am struggling to recollect very much about it . The story is about a group of criminals who escape from a space penal colony . They fly to the Moon in a space - age dustbin carrier ; when there , they terrorise the dustbin men who work on the Moonbase . It strikes me that rubbish low - budget sci - fi films often involve either desert planets or , like this movie , criminals escaping from penal colonies . Why this is I have no idea . But I can say with some certainty that such films are always diabolical . This one is really no exception . It begins reasonably well with a decent credit sequence and a half - way alright dance music soundtrack . It then degenerates into a boring sci - fi thriller . So little of consequence actually happens in this movie that I am literally struggling to write a helpful review , so if you 're reading this I apologise for not being able to enlighten you to the film 's subtleties and nuances . For the record , I recall a tedious bunch of baddies , a tedious bunch of goodies , some nuclear warheads and a hologram of a naked woman . Other than that , I 'm struggling . If you feel you could be interested in the activities of lunar dustbin men then I would not hesitate to recommend this film . I would also recommend it to those of you who wish to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets .
pos	THE SUNSHINE BOYS was the hilarious 1975 screen adaptation of Neil Simon 's play about a retired vaudevillian team , played by Walter Matthau and George Burns , who had a very bitter breakup and have been asked to reunite one more time for a television special or something like that . The problem is that the two still hate each other and want nothing to do with each other . Richard Benjamin appears as Matthau 's nephew , a theatrical agent who has been given the monumental responsibility of making this reunion a reality . This warm and winning comedy is a lovely valentine to a forgotten form of entertainment ... vaudeville and it works mainly thanks to one of Neil Simon 's better screenplays and outstanding work by Matthau , Burns , and Benjamin . Burns won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this , but I think Matthau walks away with this film with his flawlessly hilarious performance as Willy Clark . Matthau was nominated for Best Actor but did n't stand a chance against Nicholson for ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO 'S NEST ; however , in another year , this was an Oscar - worthy performance . Matthau commands the screen and there is not a false note in this beautifully timed performance . The scene where he is auditioning for a potato chip commercial and ca n't get the name of the product right is a classic . THE SUNSHINE BOYS is a warm and winning Neil Simon comedy which shines thanks to unbeatable chemistry between Matthau and Burns .
neg	This is a horrible movie . All three stories are bracketed with a psychiatrist hypnotist line which is unnecessary and all the stories are bad . The first is about wild wolves and some lady , there are some things that do n't make sense , but the hypnotism thing makes up for that . The second one , with bad Bill Paxton as a maniac roommate should not be viewed by anyone . The last one , sadly the best is almost incomprehensible which I guess makes it better than the other garbage .
pos	The film notes describe the main role family , as Turkish immigrants which living in Denmark . However , it is so clear to understand that the fact is , the behavior and the culture point the family is absolute Kurdish . Similar social pressures and even cultural murders keep going on Turkey today on Kurdish ethnicity societies . What a worry ... It is widely accepted issue in Turkey today , the Kurdish immigrants living in European Countries today , which have moved from Turkey at 70 's are culturally connected to the feudal moral laws system , by growing daughters and women under pressure , are giving harm to the Turkish International Image . Also , as same as widely accepted another issue is the Turkish or Kurdish immigrants on these countries are the reason negative aim about the Community Europe Nominee .
neg	Very rarely do I give less rave reviews on a show or film I dislike on IMDb , but Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is just so painstakingly dreadful , it 's terrible . I would n't have minded if this had been an animated series- would 've been better that way I guess , but as a live - action show , it typifies the terms ' cheesy ' and ' campy ' . Of which Power Rangers is . Five multi- coloured , spandex wearing teens battle evil by using their martial arts skills . The costumes are horrid- they look like something that is reminiscent of what track and field athletes and female gymnasts would wear . The acting is woeful , and the fight choreography is so shockingly bad and so lame to watch , it makes Jean- Claude Van Damme , look as equally as good as Bruce Lee , which is an understatement in itself . In fact , they look as if they are jumping and dancing about ; like it was some version of the ' Nutcracker ' , or they were doing ballet , rather than fighting . Besides , there are some cartoons that heavily feature martial arts and yet it is done in a fun - yet not so cheesy way that makes it look silly . Kids show or not , this is just so lame and on the verge of absurdity . And even though this version is set in America , you could be forgiven into thinking that as you watch some of the fight sequences that they were not filmed in the US , but rather in Japan ; thus the somewhat ' fake ' fighting and footage was borrowed from the Japanese version - only to be juxtaposed onto the US version . If you like this type of thing , then stick with Sentai- the Japanese equivalent .
pos	Unfortunately , this film has long been unavailable ( as other posters have noted ) , but this is one of the essential dramas of the Great Depression , a lyrical and touching drama of love set in a shanty - town . It features performances by Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young that are just about the finest of their careers , and it 's a surpassing example of how the director , Frank Borzage , was able to create an almost fairy - tale aura around elements of poverty , crime , and horrendous social inequity , which just proves that how truly romantic and spiritual his talents were . This film shows how love survives amidst squalor and desperate need , and it is totally life - affirming . This is a real masterpiece of the period , and is a movie that deserves to be more widely known .
neg	I was talked into watching this movie by a friend who blubbered on about what a cute story this was . Yuck . I want my two hours back , as I could have done SO many more productive things with my time ... like , for instance , twiddling my thumbs . I see nothing redeeming about this film at all , save for the eye - candy aspect of it ... 3/10 ( and that 's being generous )
pos	This is cult stuff . My friends and I get together once a year to enjoy this movie . Its very funny and very dry . I 've seen this move dozens of times and have yet not to enjoy it . The actors are funny and it gets better with every viewing ! If you enjoyed " Morons from out of Space " you will love this . A great play on War of the Worlds . I love the Red - Neck rampage to get the aliens , the bug on the hood , the DOD , the Heat Seeking Populous Annihilator , the Mine Field , the Red Camo , breaking the speed limit by 1800Mph ! " I 'll get the bucket ! " Very Funny . I would love for this to come out on DVD ! Forget the negative reviews see it for yourself !
neg	One of the most disgusting films I have ever seen . I wanted to vomit after watching it . I saw this movie in my American History class and the purpose was to see an incite on the life of a farmer in the West during the late 1800 's . What we saw were pigs being shot and then slaughtered , human birth , branding . Oh and at the end there was a live birth of a calf and let me tell you that the birth itself was n't too bad , but the numerous fluids that came out drove most people in my class to the bathroom . The story itself was OK . The premise of the story is a widow and her daughter and they move to the west to be a house keeper of this cowboy . They live a life of hardship and it is an interesting a pretty accurate view of life in the West during the late 1800 's . But if you have a choice , do not see this movie .
pos	Glacier Fox is one of the most heartrending and wonderfully photographed wildlife films ever made . The film makes you care about each member of this fox family , from the blind cub to the strongest - their adventures are at times hilarious and also tragic . Set against an inhospitable countryside , the audience 's hearts warm to the family members . The music score and lyrics tell the story intercut with narration about what is happening in general terms . Man remains one of the biggest predators , but we are left in no doubt that the foxes are capable of living , not just surviving beyond human endeavours .
neg	I had high hopes for this movie . The theater monologue is great and Nic Balthazar is a very interesting man , with a lot of experience and knowledge when it comes to movies .   I am a fan of a lot of Belgian movies , but this movie is bad . It 's completely unbelievable that actors who are 34 are suddenly playing the roles of teenagers . The " linguistic games " were hideous and over the top . Nothing about the film seemed real to me . The ending was way too deus ex machina for me . I am very disappointed and think I wasted an hour and a half of my life .
pos	HUSBANDS BEWARE is a remake of the Shemp classic BRIDELESS GROOM . The film 's new cooking scene at the beginning of the film is great . The stooges are always funny when they cook . However after the first few minutes of cooking footage , we cut to original footage of BRIDELESS GROOM . One thing I noticed about these 1953 to 1956 remakes are that they do fit with the new story . They do an insert shot if the old story line does n't match . HUSBANDS BEWARE does have a new ending , but I wo n't give it away to those who want to be surprised .   * * * * out of 4 stars .
neg	This film was more effective in persuading me of a Zionist conspiracy than a Muslim one . And I 'm Jewish . Anbody go to journalism school ? Read an editorial ? Freshman year rhetoric ? These alarmist assertions , presented in a palatable way , might prove persuasive . But by offering no acknowledgment of possible opposing arguments , nor viable ( or any at all ) solutions , few sources and each of dubious origin , makes the argument an ineffectual diatribe . And thank goodness for that -- I would n't want anyone to leave the theatre BELIEVING any of this racist claptrap . A good lesson for me -- and hopefully a cautionary tale for you -- to actually read about a film before seeing it .
pos	Omar Epps is an outstanding actor . I really think he gets into his character alot . When deja gets shot he shows true emotion . He also shows true emotion when remmi puts the gun to him in the room . Omar is a very talented actor ! !
neg	This was a cute movie until the ending . The ending was merely one more despicable effort to emasculate men and empower women at their expense . The girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used her passive / aggressive nature to control and impose her will on the guy who ultimately yielded his power and control over the relationship to her . It is not by chance that she was sitting behind the driver 's wheel in the car as they drove away at the end after he had to beg her and plead with her to take him back . This movie is a victory for all women who think they should be in charge of all men and in control of their relationships with them . It was a despicable movie for that reason .
pos	I first saw this video 15 years ago . I thought it was excellent then and I still do . I am a former teacher of English ( high school and college ) and a lover of English Romantic poetry , so Coleridge rates highly with me . Anything which might detract from the beauty of the poem or the power of the story would n't get my vote of excellence . In this case , everything works well to engage the viewer , especially high school students . The story is well illustrated for a generation which grew up on television . In addition , the voice of Michael Redgrave adds a sense of authenticity and authority to it . Okay , so there was n't a big budget for the project . So it was n't Star Wars and there 's no CGI in it . But who can dismiss Gustave Doré illustrations as part of the presentation ? The comment above , which in just four lines dismisses the video as a piece of trash , is grossly unfair and unperceptive . I 'm a friend of the producer , but that is n't my reason for this comment . Rather , I 'm defending a work of artistry which I think has value on all levels . It is well suited to bring Coleridge 's poem to students in a way which awakens their appreciation of it and awakens their sympathy for the lesson which the ancient mariner imparts .
neg	You remember the Spice Girls movie and how bad it was ( besides the songs ) , well their manager Simon Fuller ( also this band 's manager ) makes the same error putting S Club ( another of my favourite bands ) in their own film . S Club : Tina Barrett , Jon Lee , Bradley Mcintosh , Jo O'Meara , Hannah Spearritt and Rachel Stevens ( what happened to the seventh member , Paul Cattermole ? ) basically ask their boss for a break , they go on , and while there they see themselves on TV ! Three of them swap , and vice versa , half discover they are clones made by a greedy scientist , and the other half just get themselves in trouble . Also starring Gareth Gates as a clone of himself . This film may have more of a plot than Spice Girls ' film did , but besides the songs " Bring It All Back " , " Do n't Stop Movin ' " and " Never Had A Dream Come True " this is no goo reason to see this film . Not too long after the band split for good . Adequate !
pos	Love Rosario Dawson , think she 's one of the finest actresses of the modern era . Descent seems to be more about self - empowerment than anything else . It 's the consistent undertone in everything in the film . The dialog is flat , the characters seemingly intentionally bland and one sided . The only consistency is the representation of self - empowerment in the characters and Rosario 's journey from self empowerment to loss of empowerment and back again . Pitching this as a rape classic is n't appropriate , and that 's probably why so many people do n't enjoy the film . The standard ' rape ' audience would n't particularly like this film , and maybe that 's the point ? The film asks more questions than it answers , and it does confront it 's target audience , whether they like it or not . There 's a compelling relationship between the characters and the target audience and while the film does n't slap the audience across the face with self - righteous audacity it does engage the viewer for what may or may not be , all the wrong reasons . Descent is a good film which IMHO is severely under - rated .
neg	Acting is horrible . This film makes Fast and Furious look like an academy award winning film . They throw a few boobs and butts in there to try and keep you interested despite the EXTREMELY weak and far fetched story . There is a reason why people on the internet are n't even downloading this movie . This movie sunk like an iron turd . DO NOT waste your time renting or even downloading it . This film is and always will be a PERMA - TURD . I am now dumber for having watched it . In fact this title should be referred to as a " PERMA - TURD " from now on .

pos	I read all of Nancy Drew as a preteen and collect the books as a grown - up . I loved the effect used at the end ( and a little bit at the beginning ) of the movie where line drawings in the style of the books morphed into scenes from the movie . It was a neat way of pointing out connections between situations in the movie and the books . For example , the scenes with the Oriental antiques dealer were very reminiscent of many scenarios I remember from the books . I thought Ned was perfectly cast , and Emma Roberts was a wonderful 21st century interpretation of Nancy Drew . ( Just like the picture of Betty Crocker , she keeps up with the times ! )
neg	This movie is a modest effort by Spike Lee . He is capable of much more than this movie . Get on the Bus while apparenly anti racist , does nothing but berate whites and degrade the black status quo . The plot of this movie is about a group of black men who travel on a bus to Louis Farrakhan 's million man march . The bus has every type of person you could imagine : gay , muslim , gangbanger and the Uncle Tom(He is thrown off the bus though ) . There was one only white person on the bus . He was accused of being a racist the minute he got on the bus to drive . Despite him being a jew and the fact that he explained is situation he ended up being a racist and leaving the bus . I hate to say it but films like this need to realize their own hipocracy and rienforcation of steryotypes . This should not be seen as a triumph but a sad dissapointment . You may think I am a racist for writing this but I mean well . Better luck next time Spike .
pos	If people did n't know who Barbra Streisand was before this, ... (is that POSSIBLE?) ... they sure knew who she was after ! This show went on to win 5 Emmys , & stands out as one the best things Streisand has ever done . It 's made up of 3 acts .... ACT I ... Barbra singing standards from room to room , filled with musicians , including a segment where she is a little girl again , all ending with a splendid version of her signature song,(at the time) ... "People " . ACT II .... A musical tour of Bergdoff - Goodman , while Barbra Sings poverty songs .. it 's better than it sounds ... ACT III ..... The best part , Just Barbra , musicians , & some great songs , like ..... "Happy Days Are Here Again " , & a " Funny Girl " medley .... all in all , a great part of television history , made by one of the greatest performers in the world !

pos	I watched this movie expecting what I got : good sci - fi cowboy stuff . What really surprised me was that Kurt Russell did such a great job with an extremely limited role . Imagine trying to act under these two restraints : you have hardly any dialogue , and because you are playing a hardass , military robot , you are not allowed to show emotions using facial expressions ! Howzat ? Kinda like asking a diva to perform a great aria while gagged and duct - taped . In spite of being verbally and expressionally handcuffed , Russell pulls off an incredible characterization . His robot becomes human , in spite of the constraints . Great job ! As usual , Jason Isaacs insures that he will go down in history as a great portrayer of the consummate villain -- the one you 'd love to see drawn and quartered . Connie Nielsen was sweet , soft , motherly , and gorgeous . I 'm not sure how much of my impression is based on her acting and how much on her physical beauty , but it was hard to take one 's eyes off her . Unfortunately , Gary Busey 's role was too small and limited .   Much of the plot is quite standard , with a fair amount of weaknesses , but as it does have a sci - fi comic book feeling , I do n't see what 's wrong with a few weaknesses . By the end of the story the good guy wins , and the appreciative audience receives a great deal of emotional satisfaction . Yes ! The sort of feeb who thinks that Russell did n't do a good job of acting is the same sort of feeb who missed the whole point .
neg	Where to start ? ! . . . I feel ... violated ! That s right , violated ! I just spent 1.5hrs of my life , 1.5hrs that I could have spent doing something more useful , like watching paint dry , on this so called horror flick . Its not scary , its not funny , its not dramatic , its no action , its nothing ... Its predictable , its boring , its tragic ... I might come of a bit harsh here , but watch this movie and you will feel the same way ... or ... no , do n't watch it ... unless you want to feel violated also .
pos	This movie , while seemingly based off of a movie of the same title in 1951 released by MGM and starring Janet Leigh , is still a great film . Danny Glover in one of his best performances brings George Knox , a down on his luck baseball manager with a short temper , to life . As for this movie being " stacked " , how about adding Christopher Lloyd ( his stage experience works and shows through in his performances on screen , a wonderful actor ) , Joseph Gordon - Levitt ( Third Rock from the Sun ) , Brenda Fricker ( a charming and well seasoned Irish actress ) , Tony Danza ( yes even he is good in this film ) , Matthew McConaughey ( he stole the show in Dazed and Confused , and his role may not be as pivotal in this film , but he got exposure ) , Adrien Brody ( what I said about Matthew McConaughey goes the same for Adrien , except the Dazed and Confused part ) , some great character actors like Taylor Negron ( David ) , Tony Longo ( Messmer ) , Jay O. Sanders ( Ranch Wilder ) , Neal McDonough ( Whitt Bass ) and a seasoned veteran in one of his final performances , Ben Johnson ( Hank Murphy , the owner of the California Angels ) , and the rest of the cast does a great job , plus a great storyline that is uplifting to pretty much anyone , I do n't care what recesses of depression you 're in . I loved this film as a kid , and it brings back memories when I watch it today . I need this on DVD . I recommend it to any parent who 's looking for something their kids have not seen , and everybody else , for that matter .
neg	OK , I bought this film from Woolworths for my friend for a joke present on his birthday , because the front cover had a sexual innuendo in it . But we decided it to watch it anyway . Just for hilarity purposes . And I 'm sorry , but this has got to be , one of THE worst films in history . It began off alright , and we thought " Ok this might actually be OK " . But after about 10 minutes , we were sadly mistaken . It began when the " mysterious paint baller " turned out to be the most obvious character , the Scouser / Australian ( I say that because he had an accent which could n't be identified ) , who 's acting might I just say , was abysmal . Then it got to the end , and by that time , we had all lost the will to live . The paint ball finals . The only thing I did like about this plot is that they did n't actually win , but annoyingly enough they won by default . And I know this has nothing to do with it , but the name the team were given was just awful . Critical Damage . I mean they could of picked a more awesome name , like " The Destroyers of the Anti - Christ " or something . Or that 's what the film should of been called anyway .
pos	THE SOPRANOS ( 1999 - 2007 ) Number 1 - Television Show of all Time   Everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that would n't go past a pilot episode . The Sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time .   James Gandolfini plays the enigmatic New Jersey crime boss , Tony Soprano , accompanied by a stellar cast . Edie Falco is superb as the worrying , loving upper - middle class mother ; Tony Sirico is tremendous as a superstitious , greying consiglieri who is often very funny .   While the show has often been criticised for the negative stereotype of Italian - Americans as mafiosi , and to an extent this is undeniable , I can see so many positives from the show . The portrayal of strong family values , friendships , love and compassion ; could this be present in a coarse television show about gangsters ? Yes . Furthermore , other burning issues are discussed such as terrorism , social inequality and injustice , homosexuality , drugs etc . This is no shallow , dull show about tough guys and violence . It has so much more . Many of the issues we see on the show are very real .   The writing which has been pretty much great has infused so successfully current issues and managed to imbred them within the characters ' lives , which makes the whole thing more interesting . Credit must go to David Chase who has created an excellent television treasure and to James Gandolfini , for envisioning , television 's most complex and enigmatic character .   Simply exceptional . 10/10
neg	Steven Seagal movies have never been Oscar material but with each passing release they get worse and worse . This one starts with Seagal getting picked up by the FBI because he killed a few people ' in self defence ' he 's active military so is saved from jail to rescue a stolen Stealth plane that will be used by the cliché ' evil English villain ' that Hollywood is so obsessed with including these days . Suffice to say the film has terrible dialog that is almost always delivered with a hefty topping of cheese and lack of acting talent . The story is n't interesting and there are segments of it which make absolutely no sense and do not add anything to the story , characters of movie as a whole such as the ' lesbian ' interaction between the two main females in the cast which is there purely for titilation to get viewers and yet is n't even titilating just confusing as it makes no sense as to why it happened when it did n't need to . In short a terrible script with bad dialog , delivered by sub - par actors , boring and at times badly choreographed action scenes , and non - relevant parts that only serve to achieve the near - impossible and make the movie even worse . Save 98 minutes of your life and give this miss , even if you are Seagal 's most ardent fan .
pos	One can only imagine the film Mr. Welles might have finished without the interference of the studio ! This film is a flawed Welles , but worth every minute of it because one can see the greatness of perhaps America 's best motion picture director of all times ! We can see the toll it took on Orson Welles the filming of this movie . The story has a lot of holes in it , perhaps because of the demands of the studio executives that did n't trust the director .   It is curious by reading some of the opinions submitted to IMDB that compare Orson Welles with the Coen brothers , Roman Polanski , even Woody Allen , when it should be all of those directors that must be regarded as followers of the great master himself . No one was more original and creative in the history of American cinema than Mr. Welles . Lucky are we to still have his legacy either in retrospective looks such as the one the Film Forum in New York just ended , or his films either on tape or DVD form . Rita Hayworth was never more lovingly photographed than here . If she was a beauty with her red hair , as a blonde , she is just too stunning for words . Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made an excellent contribution to the movie . The only thing that might have made this film another masterpiece to be added to Orson Welles body of work , was his own appearance in it . Had he concentrated in the directing and had another actor interpret Michael O'Hara , a different film might have been achieved altogether . Orson Welles has to be credited for being perhaps a pioneer in taking the camera away from the studio lot into the street . The visuals in this film are so amazing that we leave the theater after seeing this movie truly impressed for the work , the vision and the talent he gave us .
neg	I got this in the DVD 10 pack CURSE OF THE DEAD . You got ta love those bargain packs . For even if they do n't feature true remastering , restoration and all that hoo - ha , and the films are generally in full - frame pan and scan format , there 's no denying that there are always a few gems included . And by " gems " , I mean there 's always some good crap to be seen , especially if the films are from the ' 70s as The Mansion of Madness is . My copy is called Mansion of Madness , but when the title screens roll it 's Poe 's Dr. Tarr 's Torture Dungeon . Does n't matter , really , as crap is crap is crap , no ? Yes ! But saying this film is completely worthless is not true at all . There are some funky elements here and there , and obviously the flick did have a decent budget . The opening title sequence is cool with its colored negative run through a cheap TV look . The dialogue is always hilarious . Near the beginning of the film , the horse and buggy driver gets out to move a dead tree stump in the middle of the road . " WHAT STRENGTH ! " says Our Hero . Funny , then , that this dude should later not be able to fight off the wacky woodsmen when they come to make freaky fun . You 'll completely forget that this guy was even in the movie until he crops up again later near the end . That 's how memorable these characters are . The best part about Mansion of Madness , however , has to be the wacky music and screwball hijinks that the good guys have to endure . It 's like bad cartoon music that a three year old would find enjoyable . And why all the weirdo slapstick , anyway ? I 'd say my fave moment had to be when the horse and buggy is ambushed by the forest freaks when they pull a stupid looking homemade ghost up by a stick in the middle of the road and make the buggy stop . What the hell ? Oh yeah , there 's plenty of boobies to be seen , too , for those of you that dig such things . Boobies , bad dialogue , and wacky music . That best sums of Mansion of Madness for me . It 's well worth at least one viewing , and may be a lot better if you 've had a few to drink or whatnot . I ca n't say I was ever bored watching it , but I ca n't deny that it 's also a barrel of poop . Kinda like Magical Mystery Tour but with a plot , but not . Hmm . And Mr. Chicken PWNZ .
pos	... this is , above all else , the typical Crown International Pictures drive - in ( read " passion pit " ) programmer . The 1975 Sammy Johns hit record " Chevy Van " is heard repeatedly on the soundtrack ( this movie has even been reissued with the title CHEVY VAN ) , despite the film 's title vehicle being a Dodge . Danny DeVito makes only six minutes of on - screen appearance , but countless VHS reissues falsely credit him as the star of the flick . The movie is a comparatively sexist morality tale -- will Bobby find sexual satisfaction through the one - night - stand his customised van facilitates , or must he wait until Tina , the girl of his dreams , gives him the time of day ? Still , it is representative of the prevailing carnal dream of male American high schoolers of the time , and on that basis alone THE VAN has , almost in spite of itself , become an artifact of the period that must be referenced in any honest retrospective of the period 's popular American cinema ...
neg	This is meant to be a comedy but mainly bad taste , and nothing remotely causing a smile in the film . The movie is about a couple trying for a child , and those people in real life who are in that situation will wince at the depictions that are portrayed . For instance scenes at a fertility clinic are not in the least funny and are quite frankly embarrassing . The male lead who plays a construction worker and in his hard hat comes across as a poor excuse for a reject from Village People . The female lead is trying to look 20 years younger than she is . Both leads come across as unappealing , unattractive and completely unconvincing . There are various ridiculous and totally unassuming gratuitous scenes in the film , for example with a budget airline , which is devoid of any humor . The only reason I give this 3/10 instead of 1/10 is one mark for Shirley Maclaine , who is a a class above anything else in the pic , and one mark for some half decent(albeit old ) music .
pos	I 've watched this documentary twice - and although I 'm an major movie buff , most documentaries do n't hold my attention . This film however was mesmerizing . Almost every shot is perfect - saying so much more than an audio commentary ( which this documentary does not have ) . The concept of this film is amazing , I ca n't praise it enough . Mardi Gras beads - who would have thought ? ?   Amazing and excellent choices of interviews - film footage of a factory in China - the film makes you feel like you are actually there . I 'm political aware - and I 've read several books on globalization so there was n't anything in this film that was a surprise to me . However , it 's made me think so much .   I wish so much too , that this world was a better place . A million kudos to the filmmaker - and thanks for making this film too . I wish everyone could see it .
neg	After just finishing the book the same day I watched the movie , I knew what was supposed to happen . I had high expectations of the movie , because of the rating . The only reason I give this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was alright trying to be a movie . I have a couple main points for not liking this movie . * * * * * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * * * * * * * * 1 . The casting . Jack Nicholson barely fits into Jack Torrence 's character . Also , I would have NEVER picked Shelly Duvall for Wendy . I pictured Wendy much differently . I can see why they picked Jack Nicholson though , the grin , the pointy eyebrows , but he 's not supposed to really look ' evil ' . He 's supposed to look normal , and he turns evil . Also , they make one of the worst movie couples . Danny was alright , he needed more life though . He acted way to droney . 2 . The screenplay . They cut out so many things that were in the book , and added things . Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to in the movie were either deleted , changed , or handled wrongly . Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to seeing ( the hedge animals , the roque mallet , the elevator ) were not in the movie , and it was 2 and half hours ! ! I was extremely irritated . 3 . The Ending . The ending was changed completly , Halorann died , Jack froze to death , Wendy never got hurt ... The Overlook did n't blow up . The Ending was so cool in the book , and the movie messed it up so horribly , I was apalled . Hallorann was never supposed to die , but Jack killed him with an ax . If they wanted to kill him , at least have Jack use a roque mallet . You never even saw a roque mallet during the whole movie . There are other things that I did n't like about the movie , but there are things that were all right . The camera angels were cool , the blood coming out of the elevator ( did n't happen in the book ) was cool , but maybe I was too irritated that the movie did n't go with the book , to try to be scared at all . I reccomend reading the book , before you see this movie . I applaud Stephen King for actually agreeing to sign a contract to not dis Stanley Kubrik any more . I would never have done that , I would have taken all the rights I could get to yell at him all day . I ca n't wait to see the 6 hour version , at least it has the hedge animals . Rating : 2/10
pos	Having read Diamond 's book , I was slightly disappointed in the series , but all in all , it is quite informative . Reading the other comments , it is comforting to know that the ' culture warriors ' are hard at work , seeing ' attacks ' on ' Western Civilization ' under every rug . Is Diamond a little preachy ? Sure . Like a lot of academics , he sees his theory as the most important thing ever . He uses the phrase ' guns , germs , and steel ' at seemingly every opportunity during the series . We get it , after about the first 10 minutes . Is Diamond a little simplistic ( in the series ) ? Sure . The part about the Spaniards in South America is particularly amusing , condensing some very long , complicated history down to ' smallpox , swords , and horses ' , wrapping up the whole conquest of South America in about 15 minutes . But the point remains valid - these things did in fact contribute ( but not totally define ) the reasons for the Spaniard 's success against the established cultures . Is he preaching * against * Western Civilization in any way ? Nope . Not a word . Not to my ear . All he says is that luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly , * not * that luck is the only reason . In the end , if you 're looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority , then this series is not for you . But if you are interested in all of the factors than influence how societies succeed or fail , this series presents a useful interpretation of the historical evidence .
neg	How has this piece of crap stayed on TV this long ? It 's terrible . It makes me want to shoot someone . It 's so fake that it is actually worse than a 1940s sci - fi movie . I 'd rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense . I remember watching it when it first came out . I thought , hey this could be interesting , then I found out how absolutely , insanely , ridiculously stupid it really was . It was so bad that I actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table . Please people , stop watching this and all other reality shows , they 're the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create .
pos	The first 50 minutes of this movie were quite boring . It focused on the personal problems Doyle had , including his sick wife , death threats by fans , a pushy publisher and feelings of guilt concerning his mentally ill father . Even though these subjects had an important impact on Doyle 's life , I was more curious about the birth of Sherlock Holmes . The last 40 minutes were excellent . We finally got a look inside Doyle head , how he created Holmes and why he had to ' kill ' Holmes . The actors are excellent . Including the intriguing Selden played by Tim McInnerny , Arthur Conan Doyle , a compelling role played by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as the ' role model ' for Sherlock Holmes , Dr. Bell . The locations are good , especially for a TV movie and the camera work is nice . If the first 50 minutes were as good the the last 40 minutes this would have been a small masterpiece .
neg	I do n't want to go off on a rant here , but ..... this is the worst " film " I 've ever seen . Worse than The Avengers . Incompetent directing , disjointed writing , and awful acting are the only consistent elements throughout . Shot on very cheap video , it looks like a high school project , but without the emotion . The lighting frequently looks like a single Sun - Gun . The sound is slightly better than a single mic on the camera , but everything else about this thing is just awful . The plot heads off in strange directions with no foundation or later resolution , the techie elements are patently absurd , and the editing looks worse than a rough cut . It 's not even bad enough to be funny . It 's just bad . BTW , the packaging is intentionally misleading . Lion 's Gate owes me $ 4.00 .
pos	DOUBLE EXPOSURE was a tremendous surprise . It contains outstanding acting ( particularly from the underrated Callan ) , fine cinematography and a compelling storyline . In other words , it 's one of the finest horror efforts to emerge from the 1980s . Callan plays a fashion photographer who experiences dreams of murdering his models , at a time when he is reunited with his psychologically volatile brother ( who happens to be missing an arm and a leg ) . When the models Callan dreams about killing actually turn up dead , the photographer begins to doubt his own sanity ... but there is more to the picture than he is seeing . This film never received the praise it deserves . Most critics and filmgoers lump it in with the horde of slasher films released at the same time , but it stands high above the bulk of that sorry lot . It 's clever and unique , which is n't something one can comfortably say about most films of this genre , but it 's also passionately crafted and performed . DOUBLE EXPOSURE is a gem of its kind .
neg	How could I best express my feelings about this movie : hideous ? a headache ? lack of coherent writing ? plain stupidity ? Try all of the above for this travesty . And that just for the direction . Story ? Well I guess there is a story . Two dumb blondes look for a job after they crash a plane into a golf course . They are mistaken for a ' world renounced assassin ' ( sarcasm ) and are ' hired ' by two ' mobsters ' . One thinks " taking him out " means a date , and the other gets the minor actor she dreams of . And of course , the turtle reserve for the farting turtle , that they build with the casino winnings . Sounds likes all this could be funny ? Guess again . They try to make it funny , but its not . Filming sequences are n't well done . I 've seen better filming in Hong Kong movies . Visuals are average for a late 80s film . But the problem is that its a 2007 movie . Not worth my time to ever watch this again . It still does n't beat Danny Glover 's " Out " movie from the early 80s as the worst movie of all time , but then again that film is in a class of its own . " F "
pos	It breaks my heart that this movie is not appreciated as it should be . its very underrated . people forgot what movies are really about , nowadays they only think about bum bum movies , which can be quite fun watching with popcorn and friends , like transformers , movies which are oriented , with hyper mega high budget like 300mln or even higher , on special effects only and which are dumb movies without storyline . Its the kind of a movie what i despite most . Of course it is fun watching greatly made CGIs , but we do not gain anything essential from that kind of movies . I honestly think that performance was excellent . Especially Busy Philipps , alongside with Erika Christensen and Victor Garber(whom i respect ) made this movie an Oscar worth . Emotional performance by Busy Philipps was astonishing , its such a shame we wo nt see Oscar in her hands , which she deserves .
neg	Years have past since Alex Rain ( played by Olivier Gruner in the first movie ) stumbled onto the horrific plot that involved replacing humans with machines however since then a war between cyborgs and humans has emerged and we lost , now a superwoman of sorts who is the daughter of Olivier Gruner 's character ( She also inherits only half of his minimal acting ability ) which I think is the films minimal connection to the first , however when the superwoman is created she hides in 1980 while a bounty hunter from the future hunts her down in this confusing sci - fi clunker . Nemesis became a cult hit , that I can see why people liked even though I was no fan of said film . Nemesis tried very ambitiously to come up with different ideas , develop a beautiful look and provide tons of action , it almost worked . Nemesis 2 does n't even have that ambition , it 's a cheap rip off of The Terminator with a muscled female who is so low on acting ability she makes Olivier Gruner seem like a master thespian and the action sequences lack the explosive scope that was the main selling point of the original . I 'll admit I was no fan of the original but it deserved a better follow up than this . The original also featured a good cast like Tim Thomerson , Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa , Thom Mathews , Brion James , Thomas Jane and yes Jackie Earle Haley this one features nobody and this time it 's just a dull movie with a pretentious vibe . In fact after I saw this , it inspired to add a half star to the original . * out of 4-(Bad )
pos	The Good Thing about this movie : The concept is interesting and there are some funny scenes . It also makes you think of those little things in life that could greatly affect the life of someone else without you ever knowing . Its a small world and this little movie shows us . The Bad Thing : There are too many characters and its hard to tell who the main character is but its still a great movie . Its a great movie and many people compare it to Magnolia which I have n't seen . 8/10 Not Rated --- I would rate it PG-13 for brief violence , some language and sexual situations .
neg	God this film was just so boring apart from the music which i really loved , i mean what was the point in actually making this movie please anyone who reads this review do not watch this film , it is a waste of time . Emraan can act but was really pathetic In this film , i am actually ashamed to be one of his fans especially in this movie , it was just really bad . Celina is just another pretty face with no lack of talent what so ever , she ca n't act at all , and there was no point of her being in this film , as for the other girl Radha she was okay i guess but could have done better . what a waste of time . please buy the great music and do n't watch this movie .

neg	This is a direct sequel to ' The Mummy 's Hand ' ( 1940 ) , because the lead character , Stephen Banning ( played by Dick Foran ) is now thirty years older and is relating the story ( with the help of archival footage ) to his son 's fiancé . There are only two unusual aspects to the film : the early death of Banning , and the presence of Turhan Bey . Lon Chaney as the mummy Kharis gets top billing , though given the nature of his role , he has little more to do than limp along or thrash his arms about . There 's nothing scary about his presence , except for his attempt to carry off the fiancé , Isobel ( Elyse Knox ) . Dick Foran gets second billing , but he 's killed off within the first fifteen minutes ! We 'd have to wait until ' Psycho ' ( 1960 ) when a lead character ( Janet Leigh ) dies way before the end of the movie ! Banning 's buddy from the first film , Babe Jenson ( now Henson ) , shows up a little later looking much , much , older and not doing any of the comic shtick he did in the original . It 's hard to believe it 's the same actor ! Unfortunately , this great acting job is wasted because he gets killed by Kharis after only two brief scenes . It 's then left up to Banning 's son John ( played by bit player John Hubbard ) to led the chase to the cemetery -- NO ! The sheriff leads a torch wielding mob to Banning 's house to burn it down and kill the mummy . Sound Universally familiar ?   Turhan Bey is introduced to audiences as the new High Priest , Mehmet Bey , to care for and feed tana leaves to Kharis . With his ' exotic ' voice and appearance , it 's too bad he gets so easily killed . A better movie would have had ' Babe ' take Von Helsing type charge of things in tracking down the mummy , with a final decisive battle with him and Mehmet Bay . But instead we have a pedestrian rehash of different set pieces from previous Universal horror films , put together by the hack Griffin Jay who wrote many of Universal 's other clunkers , although he also did ' Don Winslow of the Navy ' ( 1942 ) as well as ' Don Winslow of the Coast Guard ' ( 1943 ) which also featured Elyse Knox . Elyse Knox played Anne Howe in six Joe Palooka movies ( 1946 - 1949 ) , and of course , Turhan Bey , with 43 movie and TV credits , is great in the title role of ' The Amazing Dr. X ' ( 1948 ) . The cinematography is much darker and more atmospheric ( with lots of noirish shadows in the sheriff 's office ) than the first ' Kharis ' mummy film , but there 's little else of interest or excitement . I 'll give it a 3 .
pos	Wow this was a great Italian " ZOMBIE " movie by two great director 's Luci Fulci ( " ZOMBIE " ) and Bruno Mattie ( " HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD " ) Lucio started this movie and was ill so the great Bruno took over and it turned out surprisingly better than I expected it to turn out so if you have seen " HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD " directed by Bruno Mattie and if you saw " ZOMBIE " directed by Lucio Fulci and liked both or one of theme then this is a movie you must watch it has great " ZOMBIE " make - up witch equals great looking " ZOMBIES " has a funny " ZOMBIE " flying head!And " ZOMBIE " birds that spit acid at you and turns you into a " ZOMBIE " ( That Only Happed To Two People ) but they are mainly just the great toxic " ZOMBIES " like in Bruno Matties " HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD".So if you like Italian " ZOMBIE " movies or just " ZOMBIE " movie 's in general than check this one out its a great Italian " ZOMBIE " movie !
neg	Basically this is an overlong , unfunny , action / comedy . First of all I 'd like to say that I did enjoy the Wayans brother Scary Movie ( 1 ) and the sequel had it 's moments . Unfortunately white chicks does n't even deliver HALF the laughs .   The humour in it is absolutely crude . If you like burping , farting , stupid catchphrases you should probably look at this . When it is n't crude it 's idiotic . The first 10 minutes of the film gave everything away to me , totally unfunny , simply idiotic .   However I watched the whole thing since I was with a friend ( otherwise I would n't have bothered ) . The story is undeniably thin , it was in scary movie too but there at least the laughs were quick and constant . I think this is probably one of the main problems too with this film , the laughs do n't come quick enough . Some jokes are dragged out too long when they 're more disgusting than funny in the first place . If you prefer your comedy with a few brain cells then just avoid this . If you want a silly comedy with more laughs then look at scary movie , airplane , hotshots 1 + 2 .   1/10 Completely unfunny , Thin storyline , A film that seems to be based on one idea ( i.e. what if we dressed up as white chicks for a film ? ) but simply did n't have enough material .
pos	The sword fighting was out of this world , the fights scenes spectacular without the flying on a wire techniques ( until the end ) that are way too common today . The scene with Chan and Pray was probably the highlight of the movie . The characters in the assault on the bad guys mansion were cliché but the movie is comfortable with it . An injection of humour from Woo . The plot with it 's twists and turns was unpredictable and exciting and you could n't tell who was good or bad or which side people were on .   A good sense of suspense and well timed surprises . The depth of the story is quite intense for a flighty film of this genre and reaches you in ways most kung - fu flicks do n't .
neg	Average viewers looking for any sense of internal coherence in a film should probably give this one a pass . It generates the same feeling as staring at a curious array of individual images that seem to have some relationship one to another , but never coalesce into a totality . While this isolative approach to creating a kind of cinematic montage may appeal to a few students or critics steeped in the inside language of contemporary filmmaking , it is flatly irritating and condescending to us commoners who just fell off the haywagon . An overt avoidance of accessibility may be the intentional hallmark of auteurs like Kar - wai Wong and Tarantino , but to me it comes across as Andy Warhol warmed over . The only redeeming characteristic I find is in the production values , and them there just ai n't going to cut it all by themselfs . This is one of those productions in which you watch and listen and wait anxiously and in vain for some clever development of an idea or thought to sustain all the remarkable and beautiful individual scenes . Sorry . The calligraphic credits unexpectedly begin to roll just as your interest begins to stir . I get the same big yawn and let - down reading what I guess are very knowledgeable and thorough comments about this film that never lead to anything truly comprehensible . Ideas and images without some external context are not my idea of fun . Call me a philistine roaming the streets of Hong Kong looking for a bowl of chop suey .
pos	I happened to see this movie twice or more and found it well made ! WWII had freshly ended and the so - called " Cold War " was about to begin . This movie could , therefore , be defined as one of the best " propaganda " , patriotic movies preparing Americans and , secondly , people from the still to be formed " Western NATO block " of countries to face the next coming menace . The movie celebrates the might of the US , through the centuries , while projecting itself onwards to the then present war , which had just ended . Nice and funny is the way of describing the discovering of the American Continent by Columbus and pretty the " espisode " of New Amsterdam and the purchasing of Manhattan from a drunk local Indian .. Must see it ( at least once , for curiosity of fashion of propaganda through time ) ! :)
neg	This was a crappy movie , with a whole lotta non - sense and too many loose - ends to count . I only watched this movie because one of my favorite actors ( Ron Livingston ) made a cameo in it , and I continued watching it because as a girl , I love any movie that includes male nudity for a change . Later , I found myself wondering just how much more ridiculous the storyline could get , and each time it got ... more ... ridiculous . Sean Crawley ( good - looking Chris L. McKenna , whom I 've never seen before - but LOVED his little nude scene)is making ends meet as a painter , when he meets electrician Duke Wayne ( George Wendt from " Cheers " ) . Thinking he 's getting more work from Duke , Sean agrees to meet contractor Ray Matthews ( Daniel Baldwin , playing a stereotypically evil guy ) . Ray is being investigated by a City Hall accountant ( Ron Livingston in a cameo , who I 've been in love with from " Office Space " up to " Sex & the City " ) . Ray end up offering the apparently desperate - for- cash Sean $ 13k to kill the accountant , and Sean accepts the job . Sean stalks out the accountant , whose wife ( Kari Wuhrer ) he finds himself attracted to , completes the hit , and leaves - taking the file of information against Ray with him . Sean quickly learns he was being used , that Ray never intended to pay him , and Sean uses the file as leverage to get his money . Up to this point , it 's a descent flick ... generally worth watching . But as soon as Ray , Duke and their crew kidnap Sean to muscle the information about the file out of him , it just got dumber and dumber ( and still DUMBER ... ) , until finally it seemed like the film 's writer , Charlie Higson , had snapped out of a 10-day writing hangover and realized he needed to desperately figure out how to wrap up the series of implausible messes he created before a deadline or something . Without simply detailing the movie , let 's just say that in every - single - scene you watch after the kidnapping , you find yourself gasping " what the f**K ! , " baffled by the ongoing nonsense as Sean follows a fairly graphic and gross path towards redemption . In the end , so many loose - ends are left in the movie , that you begin to regret that you even watched it . This is a movie that you should only watch after it hits cable , and you should have enough beer and friends around to mock the film to it 's full value . It 's supposed to be a psychological thriller , and McKenna is a decent actor , but it 's hard to give yourself to the movie when you have " Norm " from " Cheers " and a Baldwin brother doing the dirty work , and a kidnapping strategy that really makes no damned sense . Guys will love the violence , blood and guts scenes , and the absolutely unnecessary sex scenes and boob shots . Girls will enjoy handsome Sean 's gratuitous crotch shot in a mainstream movie , when its almost always the girls that get stripped down in a movie . Personally , I hate that the only actor worth watching for more than his looks ( Ron Livingston ) is only in the first one - third of the movie .
pos	This movie pleasantly surprised me . It has a touching , slightly off - center approach that never loses your attention . This is a movie I never heard about , but if you want a " sleeper " , this is it . Great writing , production , and acting . I highly recommend it for audiences who want something thoughtful . Nick Nolte , Sheryl Lee and Alan Arkin are marvelous . Why was n't more made of this movie ?
neg	This movie must have been the absolute worst movie i have ever seen . My sister and her boyfriend went to rent Zodiac ( 2007 ) and got this one by accident . thought it was a joke before the actual movie . this was terrible i was waiting for it to get scary and it never did . this movie had not actual facts about the real Zodiac killer . The filmmakers clearly did n't even bother to research anything on the killings ... they only liked the name ... so they decided to write a script about nothing true to its name . I am upset i did n't realize it was n't the movie sooner . I try to like something out of every movie , i do n't hate movies ... ever ... except this one . If you could have given it no stars , i definitely would have . 1 out of 10 .
pos	Pegg has had a few hits in the past few years , starting with " Shaun Of The Dead " in 2004 , movie on to " Hot Fuzz 2007 " , early 2008 he came out with " Run Fat Boy Run " and now comes this , " How To Lose Friends And Alienate People " which is in many ways one of my favourite comedy 's of the year . The film is about Sidney Yound , a man who writes a failing magazine who makes fun of celebrity 's mostly because he is not one of them . Anyway , one of the most successful magazine owners ( Played By Jeff Bridges ) invites him ( Out of nostalgia ) to work at his magazine . Sidney is of course excited and moves to America , there he meets a girl currently writing a book , and hilarity ensues . This film is great and I hope more come out like it in the near future . Pegg has once again given people everywhere another good film and I ca nt wait to the see the third part of the blood and ice cream trilogy " Paul " . I Rate this film 81 % .
neg	Two years ago , on Berlin Film Festival we watched the Amos Kollek movie " Sue " in the Panorama program , with a wonderful Anna Thomson in the leading part . It 's a film about loneliness and sex , and how the one thing is compensated by the other . In the same section on the Festival now we have to complain the superfluous antithesis of Sue , " Extension du domaine de la lutte " , which now tries to convince us that loneliness and having NO sex is one and the same problem . But unfortunately we ca n't sympathize with " our hero " ( how he is called by the story - teller ) , because he is unnecessarily and incomprehensibly tired of company and himself . Own fault , I 'm sorry . I ca n't understand him . Not enough , the writer / director / actor want us admitting to him , that it 's not his destroyed self - consciousness or the passivity of his personality , what brought him so far , but the rotten society and its image of sexuality . Yes , there are some deeper insights about gender relations , but we wo n't follow him so far ... And the point is , that there is rather any sign of reflection about his own portion to the fate , having no sex . Who did n't notice yet , it 's a quite depressing film ... In the beginning , there had been some starts to be more accurate in sketching the situation . At the bed store the " hero " speaks about the hindrances buying a new bed . Perhaps it 's too broad getting up the stairs , you have to stay at home half a day ... THIS is a satire about a character , who does n't know taking the life and heart in hands , DOING something ... The movie doesn`t follow this path , but handles his characters with helplessness . Nobody believes , that " our hero " is able to instigate Tisserand for a murder . Too dull , too kind , too - passive ( not to mention Tisserand 's complex ; he has an inhibition , but he could n't be , of course , a murderer of women ! ) . To finish : There are women and the world , it 's not a device of a modern sexualized society . Help you as you can , but do n't follow the messages and the " wisdom " of this movie , which announces bankruptcy to human relationships , without seizing the real conflicts within .
pos	" Bend It Like Beckham " is a film that got very little exposure here in the United States . It was probably due to the fact that the movie was strongly British in dialogue and terminology and dealt a lot with football , ( soccer here ) , which some may have trouble relating too in the U.S. It 's unfortunate because this movie is absolutely fantastic and deserved much more coverage over here . I think the basis of the storyline , ( following a dream ) , is something many people can relate to and in the end , " Bend It Like Beckham " proves to be a good - feeling film with a source of inspiration and really good acting . I was not overly excited about seeing this film initially but now I regret not seeing it sooner . I highly recommend this movie !
neg	There are some good things about the movie . The music and cinematography is great . Alex Wilson is hot and gives a great performance . Ryan Bauer is also hot . The production was very lucky to have casted them because they really give production value to the movie . Jonny Vincent ( Sean ) and a lot of the boys in the movie that do n't speak are cute too . Why is n't the actress who plays Amy listed in the credits ? Brandon Alexander gives a great comedic performance as Clitarissa Pink . The worse thing about the movie is probably the star , James Townsend . He ca n't act . He 's also very scrawny , not nice to look at at all . His arms are like spaghetti . It 's disgusting . They have no muscle tone at all . It 's no wonder he has to make his own movie and cast himself in it . No one else would cast him in anything . James Townsend is not believable as someone who would even have a girlfriend because he acts so gay . They should have casted someone else as the lead if they wanted what 's best for the movie . Then again , maybe he just wants to use this movie as a vehicle to launch a career in soft - core porn , definitely not real acting because he would have taken some acting lessons . Plus , anyone who does porn is blacklisted in Hollywood . The most ridiculous thing about the movie is probably the casting of a tan - skinned Latina as Devon 's mother . Sonja Fisher does not seem like an actress at all . All in all , this movie is soft - core porn and is no better than something you would see on Skinemax . I think even Alex Wilson , probably the best thing about this movie , is embarrassed by it and does n't want to be associated with it . There is no photo on his IMDb page and nothing else listed , so Alex Wilson is probably a disposable stage name . Plus , I ran into him in West Hollywood one time recently and when I mentioned this movie , he just turned around and walked away . I understand . If I had worked on this movie , I would be embarrassed and would n't want to be associated with it either .
pos	I bought this a while ago but somehow neglected to watch it until last night . I do like Juliette Lewis although I 'm indifferent to Brad Pitt . After this viewing I have to admit he 's a perfectly fine actor - his character was entirely believable , and I did n't think " Brad Pitt " at all . Unfortunately I ca n't say the same for David Duchovny . I 'm an X - Files fan and I had to look twice to confirm the date of this movie , as I 'd thought it was made a few years later . I like Duchovny but found his character a little two - dimensional here , except where he 's doing voice - overs . That part was strong , seemed in character , good intonation , etc . Otherwise I kept thinking " Agent Mulder " , which is a pity . Michelle Forbes was a treat . Why have n't I noticed her before ? ( I 'll be looking up to see what other roles she 's done and seeing those asap ) I am slightly concerned about stereotyping re Lewis , this film , and " Natural Born Killers " ( a firm favourite ) . Interesting though to see a contrast of characters - in NBK she 's a willing accomplice , whereas here she abhors the violence and tries very hard not to acknowledge Early 's dark side until it 's thrust in her face . I enjoyed this film almost unreservedly . Apart from Duchovny 's character not seeming fully - formed ( and perhaps being " washed out " somewhat by Pitt 's ) , it was perfect . I was also pleased with the ending - glad that the innocent heroes did not die , yet they had to suffer first . It was realistic , tense , disturbing . If you like NBK you may well like this movie , and vice - versa .
neg	The Japanese have always had incredible ambitions in their fantasy movies . They have always been ready to destroy cities by huge plastic monsters coming from outer space and elsewhere . The problem is they have never had the money to succeed in making convincing special effects . This film , released in France under the title Les envahisseurs de l'espace , is no exception . Its ambition is to show three creatures from the giant octopus to the giant lobster trying to have the upper hand on the humans . It 's extremely awkward and laughable , but well quite enjoyable too . After all , we do like these creatures and these films after all , do n't we ?
pos	Excellent film . I cried when she cried , I loved when they loved , I was frustrated when they were . This film touched my heart . It was a reality check for me since this is reality for me , a 19 year old soldier
neg	I watched the DVD ( called BLACK WIDOW in the U.S.A. ) and felt afterward that it was , indeed , a truly awful movie . But they must have cut quite a bit out of the original film , or I missed a lot . The sex scenes had very little vulgarity and no nudity ( not even a breast ) , but I 've read several other comments on IMDb.com mentioning the vulgarity and something about a tampon . I did not see anything like that , just a bad , boring film with unlikable characters and a trite , sophomoric plot . Giada Colagrande is either paralyzed from the mouth up or Botoxed to the gills , and nary an expression touches her face . And her name makes me think of super - sizing a beverage at Taco Bell : " I 'll have the Cola Grande ! " It was actually kind of fun it was so bad , I got to play like I was in my own Mystery Science Theater 3000 , noting things like the fact that Dafoe 's skin is too big for his face . It 's really like silly putty !
pos	Tiempo de valientes is a very fun action comedy . After his great fist movie called El fondo del mar and the spectacular TV pro - gramme Los simuladores , Damian Szifron made another great work . Tiempo de valientes looks , for moments , a movie made in Hollywood . Diego Peretti and Luis Luque are two great actors and here , they have great performances . The movie is very fun and funny and it has superb moments . Tiempo de valientes is a very fun action comedy that I totally recommend if you wanna have a great time . And I have to congrats Szifron for all the talent he has . Rating:9
neg	I am currently sitting here , forcing myself to finish this . I figure I blew 6 bux on the VHS , might as well suffer for it . I remember about 4 or 5 years ago doing a search on the internet for " War of the Worlds " cause of the rumors of the Spielberg movie at the time , and I missed the old TV series from the early 90 's . The website make it out that this was a multi - million dollar budget rendition of the classic book . It was going to be a " perfect translation " . Perfect CRAP is more in tune with this film . First off , the video on this movie was glitched ! It looked as if I was watching the Full Motion Video from an old mid-90 's PC or Playstation CD - Rom video game . Sadly enough , the color quality was similar . The acting made Shatners classic " dramatic pause " look damn near Shakespearean in quality . The CG rendering of various scenes was horrendous , and green screen sequences were worse than those seen in old Dukes of Hazardd scenes . Secondly , it is slow and terribly drawn out . I sat thru 45 minutes of the video ( no promo 's at the beginning ) before the cylinder actually Opened to reveal the first alien . After that , the alien was a terribly constructed CG squid . I am now an hour into it and the most of the alien weaponry I have seen is a spinning silver disk ( crappy down even ) attached to a mechanical arm . The dramatic scenes are murdered with overly done instrumental 's . The last thing on that , for an alien invasion in the turn of the century 1900 's NO ONE is concerned for their life . It 's like they have no concept . Even though media was slow , word of mouth spreads fast and people would have known . The " illusion " of day and night was shoddy at best . Simply changing the color around the people to purple , blue or green does not signify NIGHT TIME . Perhaps some lighting and actual night time shoots would have given a MUCH better illusion . THere is a lot of wasted sequences throughout the film of just watching the " hero " gallop around or walk down silly roads . Get on with the film . I know how people get around , you do NOT need to be so in - depth . Now , finally an hour and 5 minutes into the film and they show the alien machines . Mighty Morphin Power Rangers had better looking effects . Even the skeletons of vaporized humans looked as if animated by a freshman high school computer app class student . The animations do NOT match up to the scenery at all . In closing folks , if you want " The War of the Worlds " , do one of four things . 1 ) Watch the 1953 original , 2 ) watch the early 90 's TV series , 3 ) wait for Spielberg 's rendition to be released shortly , OR 4 ) Read the frikkin book ( something we all probably did in elementary English class ) . AVOID THIS MOVIE . IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY .
pos	This is my first CG animated film that I 've ever seen . Usually , the look of other animated films made me reticent to see them . Not Ice Age . I wanted to see it the moment I saw the trailer with Scrat , the hilarious sabertooth squirrel . Ice Age was sporadically funny and overall fun film to watch . The story is basically an animated version of Three Men and a Baby , set 20,000 years in the past . The visuals were great . Simply beautiful . It 's one thing to create convincing aninmation , it 's another thing altogether to create visually arresting stuff and Ice Age is great to look at with its stylized visuals . Blue Sky Studios is a company to look out for in the future .
neg	I expect the same excitement as I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE but I was let down by just junk how can you even call this a movie ( its kinda of a mini porno ) . It made my sick when the guy was made to eat his own business . There is no story line to it at all it jumps to quickly from each murder . If you like seeing a women naked or even mens parts then there 's spots in the movie for and there 's even a masturbation spot in the movie which makes it a porno and not a movie at all . I have seen some dumb movies in my time but this is number 1 . I want be watching it again at all . The actors even look bored during the movie to me so they probably were in need of money badly to make this movie .
pos	This movie is fun to watch , does nt have much of a plot ( well , there is n't a plot ) , but there are good jokes and situations that you will laugh at . The basic storyline is Cheech is trying to have a nice date , while Chong is partying with Cheech 's cousin ( They smoke dope , go in a music store , a massage parlor , a comedy club , and even go into someones house they do n't even know ! Rated R
neg	While being a great James Arness western , this film has gone down as the worst Alamo film ever made . The story was terrible , inaccuracy all through it , and just downright untruths to boot ! Continuity was cast to the four winds . Anybody catch the cannon sequence ? The Mexicans were dumb enough to fire cannons that obviously had mud and ramrods still sticking out of the tubes . Come on ! Then there is Brian Keith 's ridiculous hat ! Costumer must of been away or something . Or just out of their mind !
pos	This was a gem . Amazing acting from the leads Liam Cunningham , Orla Brady and all the supporting cast . The movie raises a subject not only pertinent to Ireland and Irish history but to many communities around the world and many marriage units within those communities . With intensity and sincerity the movie shows how the religious convictions and traditions drove a wedge on a loving and passionate family . The title " Love divided " could n't capture it any better . Even though it was a true story and happening in Ireland of the 50th seeing how the life of the whole village erodes and " pogroms " are starting reminded me of Russian history . The intolerance and prejudice are still too powerful in the world and unfortunately it 's deeply hidden inside the human nature . Just like in the movie the Liam Cunningham 's character says " the hatred had always been there under the surface " . It was interesting to watch the moral choices people were making in this story . Also the character of a catholic priest and what happened to him in the end of the story was quite meaningful . The story however gives hope that love of two people can conquer everything and love makes us better , stronger . Liam Cunningham 's character goes through the whole transformation in the course of the story becoming a man he always wanted to be . Again acting is a top notch . Story is fast - paced . Irish countryside is as beautiful as ever . Highly recommended .
neg	I was hoping for some sort of in - depth background information on the Apollo 11 mission and what I got was some decent interview material with Buzz Aldrin Gene Krantz and other people involved in the mission , linked by over - hyped disaster - predicting sensationalising voice - over in the worst tradition of TV production . If you could cut out the voice - over and change the spin of the program to a positive testament of how people can overcome setbacks to achieve a goal out of the ordinary then this could 've been great - but I feel I 've wasted about 45 minutes of my life whilst watching a 60 minute programme . I want those minutes back .
pos	do n't mind the soundtrack , which is played out by now . Still , Debra Winger is always interesting and while this was an earlier role for her , she is quite good as Cissy , girl from the wrong side of the tracks , lived in trailer with Bud , ( Travolta ) , only to be replaced for a time by city slicker Madolyn Smith as a rival . I agree with an earlier review regarding Scott Glenn , he is used for plot only , thrown in to the mix to create suspense ; the story is predictable and contrived . Also , even though I am from the east , many of us did NOT like " Saturday Night Fever " , while it had its moments , the perpetual stereotypes are beyond criticism at this point . Worth seeing for Debra Winger ; she is still so likable , and never had that Hollywood persona we are subjected to by too many actresses today . 7/10
neg	The title should have been " The walker " . That was only he did walk . There was nothing on the movie that was good . The description of the movie does n't really comply with the plot . The only thing that I can get from the movie is that he was a good son , but a low life terrible person . I 'm sorry that I expend my money and time , on this movie . I saw people leaving the theater in the middle of the movie . I stayed hoping that it will better .... what a mistake . I got worse . If there is a suggestion that I can make to he producer is to re - direct his life to another field , because making movies is definitely no his cup of tea
pos	Bottom line - best romantic comedy ever . This movie accomplishes what all great movies strive for : the creation of a world and time that we want to re - visit and makes us glad to be part of the human race . When I am blue , this movie lifts my spirit and makes me laugh ( and that is still true after many viewings - always fresh ) . All of the actors are in top form . The characterizations are so dead on and the characters mesh so well together that you forget the actor ( usually difficult to do with Matthau , Robbins and Ryan ) . The supporting cast is consistently brilliant : Fry ( " agae " , " a total pygmy package " ! ) , Jacoby & Saks & Maher ( the three theoretical physicists as " Greek chorus " - " but time does n't exist " ) , Durning ( " something we can launch from NJ " ) , Shalhoub & Whaley ( Robbins ' boss and co - worker at the service station ) , and Curits ( Eisenhower - how many comedies have Eisenhower ? ? ) . Do n't miss this overlooked treasure .
neg	Stifler , has finished running his naked mile and is now attending Beta House . Crazy stuff happens , people run around naked and nerds are made fun of and this series is dead in the water . The Naked Mile was a crap film , but I found it to be significantly better then Band Camp . It seems they 've gone back to what did n't work for them and it shows that they do n't care either . You can tell where the target audience is and they nailed it perfectly . Young teenage boys who like to see naked women , crude humour and beer drinking will love Beta House , everyone else can pretty much look away . Star Wars became a massive success that stunned audiences with it 's ahead of its time special effects . Lord of the Rings created an entire world of mythical creatures and massive battles that dazzled the eye . The Matrix changed the way action and sci / fi films were made , specifically with the cutting edge special effects . With all the advancement in technology , we eagerly await the next big thing that will have our jaws dropped to the floor . Then comes American Pie : Beta House , which pushes the boundaries of what technology can do . When people have created spaceships , landscapes and creatures using CGI , Beta House decides to use this technology to create semen . Yes , the thing that creates life , the thing you see so many times in pornography films is created and time slows down to show us the white residue shoot across the room onto a teddy bear . Is this funny ? Disgusting ? Neither ? Beta House shows more nudity then The Naked Mile , which is surprising considering the previous installments title . Does the film need it ? Of course not , does it ever advance the plot , does it ever ? Does it ever get a laugh ? Does it ever get young boys aroused ? Yes the women are beautiful , but if I am the one who thinks there is too much nudity then you might as well just have made a porno . The female who catches the affections of our main character is pretty and does n't annoy the viewer , like previous girls have done in the series , but not once did I ever believe this character would ever do what she does . I 'm pretty sure every action from the characters in this film are far from realistic . The American Pie series has fallen from a realm of reality into a fantasy world . None of the events in this film would ever happen , if they ever did then I need to attend this school IMMEDIATELY . Is this film suppose to make people feel like they are having a good time ? Well it does n't , we are watching them have a good time , by the end of the film we hate them for all the fun they are having . There is a " Deer Hunter " scene in the film , but to make it " funny " for today 's audience they decided to substitute bullets wit horse semen . Are you laughing yet ? Instead of shooting themselves with said semen in the head , or face , they place the gun in their mouths . Are you on the floor laughing yet ? The first time we are introduced to Stifler 's roommate , he 's having sex with his girlfriend . Are you cheering at the nudity yet ? The film at first seems like it will be about the boys trying to get into the frat house , but then it shifts to them already being in the frat house , but needing to perform certain tasks . Then it shifts to a competition between nerds and the boys . It goes a little " Revenge of the Nerds " on us for a bit and it seems out of place . I honestly do not know what these film is about because it goes all over the place . Most of the comedy seems forced for shock value . Even at the beginning with the Dad showing his son the list of people he has had sex with . The joke is in there somewhere , I think it might be the fact that his wife is not the last name on the list , or it could have been that one of his son 's friend 's mother was on the list . Either one , it does n't work . I guess if you have n't guessed it yet , this film is not funny . Nor does it seem to be focused , the story is pathetic and the so called crude humour that the series has been known for does n't shock . Skip this lame installment and any future ones as well . I do not know why I have seen all the entries in the series , but for some unknown reason they seem to have found their way to my eyes .
pos	I have looked forward to seeing this since I first saw it listed in her work . Finally found it yesterday 2/13/02 on Lifetime Movie Channel . Jim Larson 's comments about it being a " sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths " were dead on . Writers probably should n't get a bonus , everyone else SRO for making the movie . Anybody who appreciates a romantic Movie SHOULD SEE IT . Natasha 's screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric , to say nothing of her beauty , that anything she is in goes on my favorite list . Her TV and print interviews that I have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking for . God Bless her , her family and future endeavors . This movie does n't seem to available in DVD or video yet , but I would be the first to buy it and I think others would too .
neg	That is the only question I am left with . Why did this movie suck so much when it had such a great cast ? Why was the writing so bad , it left the audience completely unconnected with the characters ? Why did it not make any sense at all ? Why did the studio take a perfectly good premise and " Hollywood " the hell out of it when all it needed was good , smart story telling ? Why ? I never understand why movies that start out good turn into a pile of crap by the time they 're released . I hope for the sake of Freeman an Spacey , who are Oscar WINNERS , that this never is released to the big screens in America . As someone that holds a Bachelors Degree in Journalism , the whole story is just utterly laughable . I just ... think the script had potential , but the execution turned it into a cliché , and an awful one at that . Just . No .
pos	after just having watched The Deer Hunter , which is a masterpiece , the movie Jacknife had big shoes to fill.it has same themes as The Deer Hunter , the devastating effects on a person after the Vietnam War . Robert De Niro is in this film , as in The Deer Hunter and is very good here , as is Kathy Baker.but this movie belongs to Ed Harris , who gives a powerful , emotional and impactful performance.the movie is based on a stage play , and there are one or two scenes where that felt obvious to me.by that i just mean that for those one or two scenes it felt like i was watching a stage play.that was not that big a deal , and does n't really diminish the film.i actually really liked this movie.it's not an epic like The Deer Hunter.they are about similar era and have similar themes , but they are two very different films.i thought The Deer Hunter was great , and i also think this movie was great.it's the acting in this one that makes it so great.for me , Jacknife is a 10/10
neg	Having just wasted a couple of hours watching this and for 80 % of that time in complete disbelief , I can give this garbage the turkey of the year award , no problem . To say the plot was unbelievable is some big understatement . Frankly I am lost for words to describe this utter tripe . Not only are the characters completely and utterly without any semblance of originality ( this sort of stuff has been done much better in dozens of ' serial killer flicks')but the acting was dire . For those who pay to see this , I hope you get your money back , for those who were paid to do this , I hope you GIVE your money back . Believe me folks there are many new releases out there that are much , much better . Go see .
pos	  This is without a doubt the funniest comedy of the year . Everybody is brilliant . The acting is superb . You can see that the actors enjoyed making this film . It´s a shame to spoil the film with give aways , so rent it and laugh your ass off . 9 - 10 .
neg	  A friend of mine enjoys watching the worst films he can possibly find , and I have a good laugh watching them with him . I have told him if he puts this one on again I will be forced to give him a good kicking . He knows I am serious !

neg	Sloppily directed , witless comedy that supposedly spoofs the " classic " 50s " alien invasion " films , but really is no better than them , except of course in the purely technical department ( good makeup effects ) . And any spoof that is worse than its target is doomed to fail ( " Casino Royale " , " Our Man Flint " are worse than almost any James Bond movie ) . After two hours of hearing the screeching voices of the aliens , you 'll be begging for some peace and quiet . ( * 1/2 )
pos	I tuned into this by accident on the independent film channel and was riveted . I 'm a professional actor and I was flabbergasted by the performances . They felt totally improvisatory , absolutely without affectation . I could not tell if it was scripted or how it was shot and waited until the very end to see credits and then spent a half an hour on the IMDb to find this film . Do not miss it . I see that the writer - director also did a very fine film called Everyday People which I enjoyed a lot . The shame of the film business is that projects this excellent do not get the distribution and advertising that they deserve and live under the radar . This film deserves to be flown high and proudly . I urge people to look it up and watch it .
neg	I was one of those " few Americans " that grew up with all of Gerry Andersen 's marvelous creations . Thunderbirds was a great series for the time and would have made a great action / adventure movie if only the writers could have figured out where to target it . I expected it to be a romp , but I did not expect it to aim at such a low age group . Like Lost in Space , this could have been both visually stunning and exciting . It should have focused on more action / adventure and the goal of the original series ... saving people in trouble . Instead , it focused on Alan saving the day instead of his brothers ( who were cast too young anyway vs. the original ) . The breakout part was Lady Penelope and Parker . I did n't care too much for the characters in the original , but I was grateful for them in the movie . They stole the show ! I always enjoyed Thunderbirds more for the high - tech than the stories , and even that did not get enough screen time as far as I was concerned . I would have enjoyed seeing more of the cool gadgets . But then , I 'm just a big kid ... ;)
pos	A famous orchestra conductor , Daniel Dareus , suffers what appears a heart attack as he finished conducting a concert . Suddenly , we watch him as he arrives in the small town that he has left years before . Since he left so young , and having his name changed contributes to give him a new persona . He has bought the old school building where he plans to stay . The building needs a lot of work . One would expect a man in his position to have all the comforts of the world he left behind to be installed in his new abode , but no , Daniel puts up with the harsh winter in his own way . The local pastor , Stig , whose church has a small choir , comes calling to see if he can interest Daniel in helping , but the conductor has no desire to go back to music . Daniel begins to explore his new universe . The town 's people leave him alone . He makes an impression on Lena , who works in the local store where he goes to get his food supplies . Little by little , he comes around and decides to involve himself with the choir . Lena will ultimately fall in love with Daniel . At first , the relationship between Daniel and the choir members is not exactly what he expected . As they get to know him better , they come around to accept him and make him one of them . His new position does n't endear him to the woman who used to be in charge . The members of the choir are a motley crew , but they realize the change Daniel has made in the way they interpret different songs . The new piece composed for Gabriella , a battered wife , makes a great impact in her life and that of her fellow singers . Daniel 's ideas for the repertoire clash with Stig 's own . The vicar suddenly begins seeing Daniel in a new light ; he is a tormented man who likes to read pornographic magazines before making love to his wife , Siv . His ideas clash with the dogma , as Siv points to him . Stig decides to try to put a stop to what he considers an unhealthy influence of Daniel by firing him as the head of the choir . The choir , which has been invited to participate in a competition travels to Austria . Daniel , who by now has fallen totally for Lena , has a chance to show for the first time in his life his feelings for her when she starts to gets doubts about their relationship . Daniel who is late for his own concert , gets to hear them making extraordinary music even though he is not in among them . Kay Pollak , the director of this enormously appealing film , shows he was the man to direct it . The story involves the viewer from the start . Great part of the success of the movie goes to the ensemble cast that was put together . William Nykvist , who plays the leading role is the best excuse for watching the film . Frida Hallgren , Niklas Falk , Ylva Loof , do excellent work for Mr. Pollak . Stefan Nilsson is the composer for most of the beautiful music one hears . Harald Gunnar Paalgard 's cinematography makes the film look better capturing different seasons for the viewer in their beauty .
neg	this has got to be one of those films where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itself . I first saw the trailer in 1991 , it looked great . Since then i have always wanted to see it but could never find it ..... until today , yes , 14 years later . lets just say I was so disappointed its unreal , OK i knew it would n't be an Oscar winner but still had hopes that it would be a fun no - brain film in the bloodsport mold . Unfortunately it was not , it 's Pooh what s with all the American rock and roll music and the acting was so bad it was quite frightening . The fight scenes were rubbish and look fake . this DVD only cost me £ 5 and I believe I was overcharged by £ 7 Now I 'm sad as I know that I will never get that hour and a half back .
pos	I was literally preparing to hate this movie , so believe me when I say this film is worth seeing . Overall , the story and gags are contrived , but the film has the charm and finesse to pull them off . That gag where Jason Lee thinks he has crabs , and tries not to let his boss / future father - in - law and co - workers see him scratching himself is n't terribly intelligent , but it sent me into a frenzy of laughter . Very few of the film 's gags are high - brow , but they made me laugh . As I said , the film has charm and charm can go a long way .   The characters are likable , too . I must say I wish I got to see more of James Brolin 's character , since he was a hoot in the very few scenes he was in . Plus , I admire any romantic comedy that has the guts to not make the character of the wife ( who serves as the obstacle in the plot ) a total witch . The Selma Blair character is hardly unlikable , and there 's never a scene where I thought to myself , " Why did he want to marry her in the first place ? " The ending is Hollywood - ish , but it could 've been much more schmaltzy .   The cast is talented . I have n't had a favorable view of most of Jason Lee 's mainstream work . I just loved him so much in Kevin Smith 's films that I could n't help but feel disappointed at seeing him in these dopey roles . And he never looks comfortable in these dopey roles . Even in this movie , he does n't look perfectly comfortable , but he contributes his own two cents and effectively handles each scene . But I still miss his work in independent films . Julia Stiles proves again why she 's so damn likable . Of course , she 's a very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me want to faint , but she also possesses a unique charm and seems to have good personality . In other words , her beauty shows inside and out . I do n't know the actresses ' name , but the woman who plays the drunk granny is hilarious . Julie Hagerty also has a small part , and she 's always enjoyable to watch , which makes me wish she received better roles . I loved her so much in " Airplane " and " Lost in America " that it 's a shame she does n't get the same opportunities to flaunt her skills .   Do n't be put off by the horrible trailers and even more horrible box office records . This is a funny , charming film . Romantic comedies are getting so predictable nowadays that it feels like the genre itself is ready to be flushed down the toilet , so it 's always to see a good one among all these bad apples .   My score : 7 ( out of 10 )
neg	I saw this film opening weekend in Australia , anticipating with an excellent cast of Ledger , Edgerton , Bloom , Watts and Rush that the definitive story of Ned Kelly would unfold before me . Unfortunately , despite an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role , the plot was paper thin .... which does n't inspire me to read " Our Sunshine " . There were some other plus points , the support acting from Edgerton in particular , assured direction from Jordan ( confirming his talent on show in Buffalo Soldiers as well ) , and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the Australian bush , much as the Irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it . But I ca n't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an Australian folk hero ( or was he?) .... in what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and selling the picture in the US . Oh well , at least Jordan and the producers did n't agree to lose the beards just to please Universal ... Guess I will just have to content myself with Peter Carey 's excellent " Secret History of the Kelly Gang " . 4/10
pos	Wow , I loved this film . It may not have had the funding and advertising that the latest hollywood blockbusters get but it packs twice the emotional punch . The tale revolves around this one family from Utah and it 's the connections between the people in the family that provide the film with its punch . The main lead ( Giovanni Ribisi ) plays his part very well , at no time does he leave you to believe that he 's acting all his feelings . It 's his brother ( Elias Koteas ) who stole the show for me though . When the two were in scenes together they bounded their lines off of each other , giving fantastic performances . Great cast , great film .
neg	This is indeed quite the strange movie ... First , we have an ex - U.S .- gymnast trying to turn actor ( or something ) , and this seems to be the only role he ever got ( that I know of anyway ) -- and for good reason . While he does pull off the role well enough to keep some interest , it is a rather bland and flat performance . Second , we have the WORST EVER sound effects ever used in a movie ! ! ! I 'm not kidding . This alone makes the movie extremely comical , but in that annoying way . hehe And third , while we have a generally decent acting supporting cast ( including the required hot chick ! ) , an actually not - so - bad story , and some cool visuals ; the dialogue , fight scenes involving gymnastics ( hilarious ! ) , and overall execution of the plot are weak . This movie would have been barely better as a network TV movie ( too bad Fox was n't around in 1985 ) . It 's one of those movies that 's simply bad , yet you ca n't resist watching and even enjoying it once you get used to it , especially now that it has found the perfect eternal home on late night TV and cable .
pos	One of the most important artistic movements in the history of cinema was without a doubt German expressionism , the highly atmospheric style of film - making developed during the 20s in Berlin . Classic movies like " Das Cabinet Des Dr. Caligari . " ( 1920 ) and " Nosferatu , Eine Symphonie Des Grauens " ( 1922 ) were the most famous direct results of this movement , and while the movement did n't have a long life , its enormous influence over cinema can still be felt today , specially in the horror genre . One of the key figures of this style would be director Paul Wegener , director of 1920 's " Der Golem , Wie Er in die Welt Kam " , as in his debut as a filmmaker , seven years before the making of that classic , he was already making experiments with expressionism in film . That early prototype of German expressionism was incidentally , another horror film : " Der Student Von Prag " . " Der Student Von Prag " ( " The Student of Prague " ) , is the story of Balduin ( Paul Wegener ) , a student with the reputation of being the best fencer in Prague , but who always find himself with financial troubles . One day , Balduin rescues the beautiful countess Margit ( Grete Berger ) from drowning in a lake after her horse drop her by accident . Balduin falls immediately in love with her and tries to see her again , but soon he discovers that he 'll have to compete with her rich cousin , Graf Von Schwarzenberg ( Lothar Körner ) , who also wants to marry her . Knowing that he ca n't offer her much , Balduin wishes to be wealthy , and this is where a sorcerer named Scapinelli ( John Gottowt ) enters the scene . Scapinelli offers Balduin infinite wealth in exchange of whatever he finds in his room . Balduin accepts the proposal , only to discover in horror that what Scapinelli wants is his reflection in the mirror . Loosely inspired by Edgar Allan Poe 's short story " William Wilson " and the classic legend of " Faust " , the story of " Der Student Von Prag " was conceived by German writer Hanns Heinz Ewers , a master of horror literature and one of the first writers to consider scriptwriting as valid as any other form of literature . Written at a time where cinema in Germany was still being developed as an art form , " Der Student Von Prag " shows a real willingness to actually use cinema to tell a fully developed story beyond a camera trick or a series of scenes . Like most of the scriptwriters of his time , Ewers screenplay is still very influenced by theater , although " Der Student Von Prag " begins to move away from that style . While a bit poor on its character development ( specially on the supporting characters ) , Ewers manages to create an interesting and complex protagonist in the person of Balduin . While " Der Student Von Prag " was Paul Wegener 's directorial debut and Stellan Rye 's second film as a filmmaker , it 's very clear that these two pioneers had a very good idea of what cinema could do when done properly . Giving great use to Guido Seeber 's cinematography , the two young filmmakers create a powerful Gothic atmosphere that forecasts what the German filmmakers of the following decade would do . Wegener would learn many of the techniques he would employ in his " Golem " series from Seeber and Rye . Despite having very limited resources , Rye and Wegener manage to create an amazing and very convincing ( for its time ) visual effect for the scenes with Balduin 's reflection ( played by Wegener too ) . Already an experienced stage actor at the time of making this film , Wegener directs the cast with great talent and also attempts to move away from the stagy style of previous filmmakers . As Balduin , Paul Wegener is very effective and probably the best in the movie . It certainly helps that his character is the only one fully developed by the writer , but one ca n't deny that Wegener was very good in his role as the poor student who loses more than his mirror reflection in that contract . John Gottowt plays the sinister Scapinelli with mysterious aura that suits the character like a glove . Few is said about Scapinelli in the film , but Gottowt makes sure to let us know that he is a force to be feared . The rest of the main cast is less lucky , with Grete Berger being pretty much average as countess Margit , and Lothar Körner making a poor Graf Von Schwarzenberg . However , it must be said that Lyda Salmonova was pretty good in her expressive character and Fritz Weidemann made an excellent Baron Waldis - Schwarzenberg , showing the dignity that Lörner 's character should have had . Considering the movies that were being done in those years in other countries and the fact that its remake ( made 13 years after this film ) is superior in every possible way , it 's not difficult to understand why " Der Student Von Prag " has n't stood the test of time as well as other early films . The movie 's main problem is definitely its extremely low budget , as it resulted in the film being considerably shorter than what Ewers ' story needed to be fully developed . This makes the plot feel a bit too vague at times , or even incomplete , as if there was something missing in the narrative ( of course , there 's also the possibility that the existing print is really incomplete ) . However , " Der Student Von Prag " is a very interesting early attempt at a complex tale of horror and suspense in film that , while inferior to what other filmmakers were doing at the time , left a powerful impression in history . As the direct predecessor of the German expressionist movement , it 's hard to deny the enormous importance that " Der Student Von Prag " has in the history of German cinema , probably in the history of cinema in general . It may look dated even for its time , but considering the limited resources its director had , it 's truly better than most films from that era . As the movie that started Paul Wegener 's career , and with that German expressionism , " Der Student Von Prag " is a must see for everyone interested in this slice of film history . 7/10
neg	What can I say about this film other than " do n't see it " . I waited and waited and WAITED for someting ( or anything ) to happen and it just did n't come . Watch amazingly as two people walk around while setting the record for most filler screen time in a single movie . What are they doing ? Are they solving a mystery ? Are they gathering clues ? Possibly , it 's just hard to tell . At the end of the movie , after a lot of radio signals are decoded ( illegibly on some sort of PET monitor ) and this guy gives some lectures , the plot is finally revealed and tossed aside as quickly as possible . Some aliens want to get back to their home world utopia and are so happy there that they want to blow up the earth ( I guess they do n't like sharing the wealth ) . My guess is they finished filming and saw their 35 minute work or art ( garbage ! ) and decided that they 'd let the editing crew turn it into an 88 minute feature film . Watch at your own peril , it 's not even funny because it 's so bad , it 's just bad .
pos	This is a short , crudely animated series by David Lynch ( as it says in the beginning ) , and it follows the misadventures of a backwoods , overall - wearing large man , with a wife who has a stress disorder and an annoying son . Both of those elements are harped upon repeatedly in the short episodes , and there 's no real plot to be seen . It 's easier if you think of this as an exceptionally odd , slightly macabre Looney Tunes- with far more gore , profanity , bloody violence , and occasional moments of hilarity . I bought the DVD along with Eraserhead , having previously seen Eraserhead . Do n't look to this series if you want an artistic masterpiece- this is anything but . In fact , it seems to almost be a statement against such things , as its rough style spits in the face of any sort of animation convention you may see . As Lynch says , " If this is funny , it is only funny because we see the absurdity of it all . "
neg	I am writing this review having watched it several months ago .... the trailer looked promising enough for me to buy this lame excuse for a movie . It is a complete joke .... and literally a spit in the face of real classics of the early generation of horror like Texas Chainsaw Massacre ( 1974 ) which they even had the gall to compare itself to on the back of the cover art . The producer who played Brandon should go flip burgers and serve up greasy hamburgers .... hell he might not even be good at that either ! The lighting was bad bad bad and a big annoyance through out the film you could n't even see the actor 's faces sometimes . I do n't even remember the rest of the cast members which is sad really , bad they never do anything to impress you to make them memorable . That 's all the time I will waste on this review PLEASE stay as far away as you can from this pile of junk even if you get it for 25 cents do n't do it buy s piece of gum at least IT would keep you entertained ! If you want good quality low budget fun , far better than this ... then check out a Jeff Hayes film .... because it takes talent to make it in horror and the kid has it ! I gave this 1 star just for the cover art .... thats the only thing worth liking abut this so called " film " -Rick Blalock
pos	I think the weighted average for this film is too low . I give it a 7 . Very entertaining , although over the top in a few places . My wife says it passes the Danielle Steele test . Superb performances throughout , particularly by Andie MacDowell .
neg	The reviews I read for this movie were pretty decent so I decided to check it out . BAD IDEA ! This is another movie about a ghost out for revenge against a group friends . The story is stupid , mix two parts Ringu with one part Prom Night , a sprinkle of I Know what you did Last Summer , and add a tiny dash of Single White Female - now blend until completely nonsensical . There is nothing new to this plot , and revisiting the clichés I 've grown so fond of was n't even entertaining this time . This movie jumps to and from the past too much , and once I made sense of it all I realized it still did n't make much sense . Characters go from sane to psycho killer in the blink of an eye . Speaking of characters , they are all your stereotypical favorites - the greedy selfish lawyer , the egocentric actress , the has - been baseball star , the video voyeur , the bitter girl , the spooky quiet chick , the ' nicer - than - nice ' nice girl , a freakin ' black cat ... and I did n't care about any of them . Perhaps a better writer could have made the movie work , there were some decent scenes in it , but overall this movie was a mess . I should also mention a certain ' video tape ' that would have been IMPOSSIBLE to shoot .   This movie is n't the worst Asian horror has to offer by far , but it is still pretty bad . If you just want to see some creepy images in the dark , or just want to laugh out loud at some over the top acting , or just want to yell " you 're stupid ! " at a movie screen , or just want to have another Asian horror flick up your sleeve when someone asks you how many you 've seen - this movie is for you .   Those seeking a decent plot look elsewhere .
pos	It is projected that between 2000 and 2020 , 68 million people will die prematurely as a result of AIDS . The projected toll is greatest in sub - Saharan Africa where 55 million additional deaths can be expected . Beyond the grim statistics are personal stories that we rarely hear about . Christophe Honoré describes one of the most moving in Close to Leo , a film produced for French television as part of a series dealing with issues facing young people . Though fictional , it deals with a situation that is unfortunately too common -- the effect of a diagnosis of HIV on a loving close - knit family . When twenty one - year old Leo ( Pierre Mignard ) tells his parents and two teenage brothers , Tristan ( Rodolphe Pauley ) and Pierrot ( Jeremie Lippmann ) that he has AIDS , the family is devastated . Out of concern for his youth , they decide to withhold the information from his youngest brother , 12-year old Marcel ( Yannis Lespert ) but he overhears the conversation and begins to sulk and act erratically . When Leo goes to Paris for treatment , he takes Marcel with him but the young boy confronts Leo and demands to know the truth . Leo tells him that he is ill and Marcel is sad but accepting . When he brings Marcel along to meet some former gay friends , however , tension between them boils to the surface , setting the stage for a riveting conclusion .   Although I was uncomfortable with scenes in bed involving physical contact between the brothers , I feel that the sincerity of Close to Leo and the brilliant performances by Lespert and Mignard more than tip the scales in its favor . Seeing events unfold from the young boy 's perspective gives the film an authenticity that reminded me of the Quebecois film Leolo and Truffaut 's The 400 Blows . Unlike some American films that dance around the anguish of AIDS , Close to Leo tells a harsh truth but does so in a way that is tender and wonderfully real .
neg	I rented this film out having heard of the fuss about it not being put up for an Academy Award , but after watching it , it 's easy to see why it did n't . Despite the beautiful photography , the film is incredibly slow moving , despite having hardly any plot . The plot is about a young boy trying to come to terms with his parents ' death in what may or may not have been an accident ( the film is never clear on this ) , and how his grandfather used to tell him fairy stories . The fairy stories contain the only bits of interest in the plot , but they 're very short , and do n't really seem to have any point .   The first fairy story in particular concerns a boy trying to get a magical flower to his dying girlfriend to save her life , but the boy delays by tasting the flower first to make sure it is not poisonous which results in him being a few seconds too late to save his girlfriend - the grandfather then pronounces that the moral is that the boy was too impatient , but that does n't make any sense because it was overcaution and slowness which resulted in his failure . Perfect metaphor for this film really .   The photography of Skye is beautiful though , but then Stardust which was released this year is another film about fairy stories filmed in Skye and beautifully photographed - and it 's infinitely better than this one .
pos	Cunningly interesting Western from a director who had few peers in the genre . Much like other Anthony Mann pictures , The Far Country blends a potent pot boiling story with an adroit knowing of impacting scenery . Both of which play out amongst some of Mann 's peccadilloes like honour , integrity , betrayal and of course , death ! The story sees fortune hunting partners Jeff Webster { James Stewart } and Ben Tatum { Walter Brennan } travel to Oregon Territory with a herd of cattle . Aware of the blossoming gold - boom , they plan to make a tidy profit selling the cattle in a Klondike town . Arriving in Skagway they find self - appointed judge Mr. Gannon { John McIntire } ready to meet out justice to Webster on account of Webster having fractured the law , all be it with honest cause , along the way . In punishment Gannon takes the partners herd from them , but they steal them back and head across the Canadian border to Dawson - with Gannon and his men in hot pursuit . Here beautiful women and a meek and lawless town will fill out the destinies of all involved . Interesting from start to finish , The Far Country benefits greatly from James Stewart 's bubbling { anti } hero in waiting portrayal and Mann 's slick direction of the tight Borden Chase script . The cinematography from William H. Daniels is superlative , tho not done any favours by current DVD prints , and the film has a few surprises and a " will he wo nt he ? " core reeling the viewers in . Paying dividends on re - watches for hardened genre fans , it still remains something of an essential viewing for first timers venturing into the wonderful , yet dark , Western world of Anthony Mann and James Stewart . 8/10
neg	Herbie , the Volkswagen that thinks like a man , is back , now being driven by Maggie Peyton ( Lindsay Lohan ) , a young woman who hopes to become a NASCAR champion . The only thing standing in her way is the current champion , Trip Murphy ( Matt Dillon ) , who will do anything to stop them . The original love bug was n't that good . Even as a kid , I remember not liking it very much . I had some hope for the sequel though . I mean the cast is pretty good and the trailer makes it seem like a pretty fun movie . Unfortunately , Herbie is no better now than he was before . The film is defiantly weak for people over the age of 12 . It will probably entertain the kids but that 's all . I realize it 's a kids film and all but they could have made the film a little more interesting . There were very few laughs and it got boring near the end . Most of the actors seemed dead in their roles too . Lindsay Lohan was alright as Maggie Peyton . She usually gives better performances like in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls . Matt Dillon gave the best performance out of everyone . He was very good as the bad guy even though he did n't have a lot to work with . Justin Long , Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are really just there and they do n't do anything special . Angela Robinson directs and she does an okay job . She tries to keep the film interesting but she 's working with a weak script . Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant wrote the screenplay and would it be any surprise to you that they were also responsible for Taxi and The Pacifier ? These two make light films yet they fail to really make the stories interesting or enjoyable . It 's not completely their fault but hopefully next time they will try harder . In the end , Herbie is a safe , predictable family film that 's worth watching if you 're a kid . Everyone else is better off skipping it . Rating 4/10
pos	I was expecting this to be the same kind of schlock as the previous Modesty Blaise movie , which is why I left it unwatched for so long , but I was very pleasantly surprised . Far from being a succession of silly gun battles and car / boat chases , it was an almost thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl gets to become as hard as nails , with nothing being overstated or over - rationalized . It 's likely that the budgetary constraints actually helped with that : less time and effort was spent on finding ever - stupider ways for stunt men to pretend to die , and more was dedicated to making the movie worth watching . Hell , the biggest gun battle takes place off screen -- and the scene where it is heard is all the better for that background noise , that adds to the suspense -- who 's winning ? Who 's dying ? Alexandra Staden might not be as drop - dead gorgeous as Monica Vitti , but few are , and she certainly has every ounce of class and fire that 's needed to make the character work -- and the shape of her face , her hair , and her tall , slender body could have been lifted straight from the comic - strip graphics . Nikolaj Coaster - Waldau was the perfect choice for a Blaise bad - guy , in that he made the character interesting and enjoyable to watch -- even likable ( and I doubt I 'd consider taking on many brutal , psychopathic murderers as drinking buddies ) . I ca n't think of a single one of Hollywood 's " former waiters " who could have pulled the role off that well . Fortunately , Blaise baddies always die , in the end ( no spoilers there ! ) That 's a really good thing , because all the girls who would have spent their time swooning over such a disgustingly handsome and interesting hunk can now pragmatically settle for us ordinary Joes .
neg	Losing Control is another offering in the erotic thriller genre which could be considered as the pulp fiction of the film world . Usually , they involve a roundabout route to murderous intent , interspersed with copious disrobing . This is not a complaint , especially when it is done by the stunningly beautiful women who invariably inhabit this make - believe world . Kim Ward ( Kira Reed ) is suffering a bout of writer 's block . Just by chance , ( or is it ? ) she meets a man ( Doug Jeffery ) who engages with her in ever more risky sexual encounters . The man refuses to divulge any information about himself , yet Kim steadfastly refuses to stop the affair . Her agent , Alexa ( Anneliza Scott ) thinks it will do wonders for her book sales . As in most films of this type , the denouement comes near the end but some things do not add up . I have seen enough of this kind of film to think , no change there , then - but I like them . They are so undemanding . Performances of the cast vary . Doug Jeffery carries the film as the psycho / sociopath you do not want to cross . Kira Reed looks good but fails to convince as the woman in peril . Clay Greenbush as the PI did not convince either . Finally , a note of caution about the DVD under review . Both the cover and the disc state R - rated and running time as 93 minutes but the run time is less than 86 minutes . This probably explains why the sex scenes appear truncated and why Jennifer Ludlow 's performance is cut short just as she 's getting started . 4 stars .
pos	This Cecil B. DeMille epic of the old West contains what may be Jean Arthur 's finest performance , as a hysterical , eccentric , incurably amoral , but devotedly doting Calamity Jane . She really pulled it off ! Gary Cooper is at his most taciturn , but manages some occasional pithy sayings : ' The plains are big , but trails cross ... sometimes . ' The story is a pastiche to end all pastiches . All the cowboy heroes of Western lore seem to be in there somehow except for Jesse James . Even Abraham Lincoln opens the story in person ( or at least , DeMille would have us believe so ) . There is no room for anything so evanescent as subtlety , this is a ' stomp 'em in the face ' tale for the masses . A remarkable thing about this film however is that it is a very early full frontal attack on what Eisenhower was eventually to name ' the military industrial complex ' . It is n't just a story about gun - runners , but about arming anyone for money , and doing so from the heart of Washington . But let 's not get into politics , let 's leave that to DeMille , who can be guaranteed to be superficial . The chief interest of this film all these years later is that it uses the first film score composed by George Antheil , who has a lot to say about the job in his autobiography , ' Bad Boy of Music ' . Antheil seems to have originated ' the big sound ' adopted by all subsequent Westerns , whereby the plains sing out with the voices and sounds of countless cowboys in the sky , celebrating the open spaces and interweaving common melodies . That is why it does not sound at all unusual , because we have heard it a thousand times . But he seems to have been the first to summon up the combined rustlings of all the sage brush into this symphony of the open skies which has entered into American mythic lore , and given it a soundtrack which has never varied since then , corny as it may be , but doubtless appropriate . It is amusing to see Anthony Quinn in an early appearance as a Cheyenne Indian . Gabby Hayes is in there somewhere , but you miss him in the crowd . Gary Cooper overtops them all , looming large , - but when did he ever loom small ?
neg	If somebody wants to make a really , REALLY bad movie , " Wizards of the Lost Kingdom " really sets a yardstick by which to measure the depth of badness . Start with the pseudo - Chewbacca that follows around the main character ... Some poor schmuck in a baggy white " furry " costume that looks as if it was stitched together from discarded pieces of carpeting . Work your way slowly , painfully , through more not - so - special effects that thoroughly deny the viewer from suspension of disbelief . Add a garden gnome ( just for the heck of it ) . On second thought , skip this movie entirely and find something else to do for an hour and a half .
pos	What seemed at first just another introverted French flick offering no more than baleful sentiment became for me , on second viewing , a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentation . Spoiler of sorts follows . Poor Cedric ; he apparently did n't know what hit him . Poor audience ; we were at first caught up in what seemed a really beautiful and romantic story only to be led back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch . These two guys just did n't belong together from their first ambiguous encounter . As much as Mathieu and Cedric were sexually attracted to each other , the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for Mathieu , an intellectual being , to find fulfillment in sharing life with someone whose sensibilities were more attuned to carnival festivities and romps on the beach . On a purely technical note , I loved the camera action in this film . Subtitles were totally unnecessary , even though my French is " presque rien . " I could watch it again without the annoying English translation and enjoy it even more . This was a polished , very professionally made motion picture . Though many scenes seem superfluous , I rate it nine out of ten .
neg	The tragedy is that this piece of rubbish was part of my curriculum while I was studying cinema . So imagine how I was forced to watch it in complete . Believe me going through hell is much much easier . Our professor told us that this is some film ? ? ? , but he never thought that we 'd disagree or assume the apposite . I do n't think that there is any gods on earth , we 're only humans , so all the filmmakers , therefore they CAN make mistakes , bad movies .. Or very bad too . The main problem was n't that art , by all means , is susceptible to endless points of view , but that a lot of people just do n't get it , that every single human got his own genuine taste , his own opinion , hence what I suppose it the greatest movie ever made , can also be your worst one ever , and how that is right both ways , but how many people can understand this correctly ? . So my professor believes in this movie , and simply I do n't . However , the only way to evaluate this " thing " is by measuring it by its original intent to show us different kinds of old folk stories or whatever to catch on this society 's mentality , imagination , and nature . To tell you the damn truth Mr. Pier Paolo Pasolini as the scriptwriter and the director made it too unbearable to watch in the first place . The movie is so UGLY . I ca n't stand this , so how about analyzing it , then discovering the potential beauty in it ! ! It 's beyond your mind hideousness , and strangely not for the sake of the movie 's case or anything , it 's for the sake of the unstable vision of ( Pasolini ) . His work is so primitive to underdeveloped extent . The deadly cinematic technique , the effective sense of silliness , and the incredible horribleness made everything obnoxious . Look at the atrocious acting , the unfruitful cinematography , the awfully poor sets , .. OH MY GOD I 've got the nausea already . It can terminate your objectivity violently as watching this movie is one true pain like taking the wisdom tooth off by a blind doctor . There are dreadful nightmares which could be more merciful than this . So originally , how to continue THAT just to review it fairly ? Actually , you do n't . As this very movie does n't treat you fair at all . There is really memorable scene in here where some boys are peeing into the eye of the camera ( ! ) I 'm trying to connect some things like that with Pasolini 's end as murdered .
pos	" And the time came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom " - Anais Nin Marcel Proust says , " The real voyage of discovery lies in not seeing new landscapes but in having new eyes . " Author and screenwriter Antwone Fisher joined the U.S. Navy to see new landscapes but the demons of his past prevented him from seeing the world through new eyes . Based on his autobiography " Finding Fish " written many years after the events , his story is dramatized in the film Antwone Fisher , Denzel Washington 's first directorial effort . It is a heartfelt if somewhat formulaic look at the painful process of moving from being consumed by one 's past to being able to live life in present time . Required to attend therapy sessions after several outbursts of anger at the base , the painful aspects of his childhood are shown in flashback as the grown up Antwone ( Derek Luke ) recounts his life in sessions with Navy Psychiatrist Jerome Davenport ( Denzel Washington ) . He is at first unwilling to talk , but when he begins , the floodgates are opened . After his father was shot to death by a girlfriend and Antwone was abandoned by his mother after being released from prison , he was placed in a foster home where he lived for fourteen years , suffering humiliation and sexual abuse . According to Antwone , the treatment by his foster mother Mrs. Tate ( Novella Nelson ) who referred to him only as " nigga " and by his cousin Nadine ( Yolonda Ross ) was in fact much worse than shown on the screen . The only friend he has is a local by named Jesse ( Jascha Washington ) who , later in the film , only adds to his feelings of abandonment . It is difficult to build a film around psychiatric sessions but it was done successfully in Ordinary People and Good Will Hunting with a great deal more dramatic interest but it succeeds here because of the dominant performances of Washington and Luke , though the film 's attempt to compress eleven years into a few months seems a bit too facile . Davenport 's humanity and warmth , however , allows Fisher to feel safe enough to discuss his difficult past and Cheryl ( Joy Bryant ) , his new girlfriend who is also in the Navy , supports him in his struggle to achieve a breakthrough . With Cheryl 's help and Dr. Davenport 's counseling , Antwone develops enough self - esteem to return to Cleveland and begin the journey to try and find his mother in order to complete the past . What comes through in Derek Luke 's incredible performance is Antwone 's longing for acceptance , dramatized in a heartbreaking dream shown at the beginning of the film in which he is the guest of honor at a banquet filled with people who love him . Comedian Mort Sahl once said that " people just have to remember what we 're all here for : to find our way home ... " Antwone Fisher touches not only on the longing of one young person to find his way home but reaches all those who have cried themselves to sleep , not knowing the joy of being loved .
neg	After a quasi - Gothic , all - fruity music video , the movie starts with Cassidy the lead singer killing herself . In a perfect world that would be that and the end credits would roll . We do n't live n that world . The insipid band members decide to go to some clown to contact her dead essence . When I say clown , I mean actual clown . He tell them they 're all going to die via Cassidy 's ghost ( the spirit possesses Dora , one of the band - mates ) We could n't care less as the characters are all boring , vapid , and extremely horribly acted . Written by Adam Hackbarth ( an incredibly apropos surname if there ever was one ) , and directed by Corbin Timbrook ( who after The attendant , and Tower of blood , HAS to know that he keeps making crap for a living ) , this movie s a constant battle between the film 's incompetence and the viewer 's need to stay awake . Not enough blood to appease gore - hounds , nor enough nudity to satisfy pervs . This movie in fact has absolutely nothing to recommend to absolutely anyone . My Grade : F   Eye Candy : Amanda Carraway gets topless   Where i saw it : Starz on Demand
pos	Blood Castle ( aka Scream of the Demon Lover , Altar of Blood , Ivanna -- the best , but least exploitation cinema - sounding title , and so on ) is a very traditional Gothic Romance film . That means that it has big , creepy castles , a headstrong young woman , a mysterious older man , hints of horror and the supernatural , and romance elements in the contemporary sense of that genre term . It also means that it is very deliberately paced , and that the film will work best for horror mavens who are big fans of understatement . If you love films like Robert Wise 's The Haunting ( 1963 ) , but you also have a taste for late 1960s / early 1970s Spanish and Italian horror , you may love Blood Castle , as well . Baron Janos Dalmar ( Carlos Quiney ) lives in a large castle on the outskirts of a traditional , unspecified European village . The locals fear him because legend has it that whenever he beds a woman , she soon after ends up dead -- the consensus is that he sets his ferocious dogs on them . This is quite a problem because the Baron has a very healthy appetite for women . At the beginning of the film , yet another woman has turned up dead and mutilated . Meanwhile , Dr. Ivanna Rakowsky ( Erna Schürer ) has appeared in the center of the village , asking to be taken to Baron Dalmar 's castle . She 's an out - of - towner who has been hired by the Baron for her expertise in chemistry . Of course , no one wants to go near the castle . Finally , Ivanna finds a shady individual ( who becomes even shadier ) to take her . Once there , an odd woman who lives in the castle , Olga ( Cristiana Galloni ) , rejects Ivanna and says that she should n't be there since she 's a woman . Baron Dalmar vacillates over whether she should stay . She ends up staying , but somewhat reluctantly . The Baron has hired her to try to reverse the effects of severe burns , which the Baron 's brother , Igor , is suffering from . Unfortunately , the Baron 's brother appears to be just a lump of decomposing flesh in a vat of bizarre , blackish liquid . And furthermore , Ivanna is having bizarre , hallucinatory dreams . Just what is going on at the castle ? Is the Baron responsible for the crimes ? Is he insane ?   I wanted to like Blood Castle more than I did . As I mentioned , the film is very deliberate in its pacing , and most of it is very understated . I can go either way on material like that . I do n't care for The Haunting ( yes , I 'm in a very small minority there ) , but I 'm a big fan of 1960s and 1970s European horror . One of my favorite directors is Mario Bava . I also love Dario Argento 's work from that period . But occasionally , Blood Castle moved a bit too slow for me at times . There are large chunks that amount to scenes of not very exciting talking alternated with scenes of Ivanna slowly walking the corridors of the castle . But the atmosphere of the film is decent . Director José Luis Merino managed more than passable sets and locations , and they 're shot fairly well by Emanuele Di Cola . However , Blood Castle feels relatively low budget , and this is a Roger Corman - produced film , after all ( which usually means a low - budget , though often surprisingly high quality " quickie " ) . So while there is a hint of the lushness of Bava 's colors and complex set decoration , everything is much more minimalist . Of course , it does n't help that the Retromedia print I watched looks like a 30-year old photograph that 's been left out in the sun too long . It appears " washed out " , with compromised contrast . Still , Merino and Di Cola occasionally set up fantastic visuals . For example , a scene of Ivanna walking in a darkened hallway that 's shot from an exaggerated angle , and where an important plot element is revealed through shadows on a wall only . There are also a couple Ingmar Bergmanesque shots , where actors are exquisitely blocked to imply complex relationships , besides just being visually attractive and pulling your eye deep into the frame . The performances are fairly good , and the women -- especially Schürer -- are very attractive . Merino exploits this fact by incorporating a decent amount of nudity . Schürer went on to do a number of films that were as much soft corn porn as they were other genres , with English titles such as Sex Life in a Woman 's Prison ( 1974 ) , Naked and Lustful ( 1974 ) , Strip Nude for Your Killer ( 1975 ) and Erotic Exploits of a Sexy Seducer ( 1977 ) . Blood Castle is much tamer , but in addition to the nudity , there are still mild scenes suggesting rape and bondage , and of course the scenes mixing sex and death . The primary attraction here , though , is probably the story , which is much a slow - burning romance as anything else . The horror elements , the mystery elements , and a somewhat unexpected twist near the end are bonuses , but in the end , Blood Castle is a love story , about a couple overcoming various difficulties and antagonisms ( often with physical threats or harms ) to be together .
neg	This sci - fi adventure is not the best and by no means the worst . I agree with the statement that bad sci - fi is comical . Bizarre pink tinting and unusual special effects make this a favorite for the late , late , late show viewers . Space explorers on the planet Mars fight off strange giant amoeba - like monsters and other strange creatures . Pretty cool . The cast includes Les Tremayne , Naura Hayden , Gerald Mohr and Jack Kruschen . Get comfy and enjoy . Do n't feel bad if you nod off for a moment . I agree with adding this to the list of cult classics to not miss .
pos	my name is Heather and i am the girl whose story this movie was based on . I want to thank all of you who saw this movie and enjoyed it . as crude and harsh as some of the things that were depicted in this movie were , it did n't really even come close to describing how bad things actually were . not to mention the affect everything had on my mother and little sister . thanks once again for the great comments that everyone had , i truly appreciate them Hi everyone ! This is Heather 's mom . It 's hard to believe that so many years have gone by since this movie was made . Harder even to believe that people were still watching it a year ago . For any of you out there who have gone thru the same or similar kind of situation , please know that there are people out here in cyberspace that do understand completely how you feel . Our thoughts and prayers are with each and every one of you .
neg	Every once in a while , a group of friends , with a minimal budget but bags of enthusiasm and talent , will create a low budget masterpiece that takes the world of horror by storm . Raimi and co. did it with The Evil Dead , Jackson and pals succeeded with Bad Taste ; and Myrick and Sanchez made a mint with The Blair Witch Project . Director Todd Sheets and his chums , however , are destined to wallow forever in relative obscurity if Zombie Bloodbath is anything to go by . A lesson in how not to make a cheapo horror , this miserable effort ( about a plague of flesh - eating zombiesnatch ) serves as a reminder that , whilst many people these days have access to a video camera , most should n't take that as their cue to try their hand at making a full - length movie . It 's not that Sheets has n't got an eye for a nicely framed shot ( some of his camera angles and movements are actually pretty good ) , but rather that a ) he has a lousy script b ) he has a lousy cast , and c ) he does n't realise that he has a lousy script and cast . Which means that the final film is amateurish in the extreme , and unlikely to be watched in its entirety by anyone other than zombie film completists ( like me ) or members of the cast and crew ( like those who have given the film favourable comments ) . Zombie Bloodbath is obviously aimed at undiscriminating gore - hounds , and Sheets ( who currently has an incredible 34 titles under his belt as a director ) certainly goes out of his way to please , with buckets of offal and blood thrown about at every opportunity . But whilst these moments are undeniably yucky , they are n't particularly convincing , and soon get rather tedious . So , to summarise , this is a really bad film , with almost no redeeming features . Except for two : Firstly , it features the single greatest mullet in the history of film , as sported by Jerry Angell , who plays Larry ( as well as several zombies ) . The magnificence of his barnet ( coupled with a fetching moustache ) is reason alone to watch this film . Secondly , it has ' pathetic stealth zombies ' : flesh - eating corpses that lie in wait for unfortunate victims to wander by , before leaping from their hiding place to launch a feeble attack , which requires almost no effort to escape from . Best known for lurking behind a door for hours waiting for someone to open it , ' pathetic stealth zombies ' also occasionally hide behind low walls , or sit in churches posing as members of the congregation . Normally a film this bad would get 1/10 for me , but , in celebration of Jerry Angell 's flowing locks , I will generously raise my rating to 2/10 .
pos	Rea , Sutherland , DeMunn , and von Sydow ( in a small role ) are all brilliant in their performances . Sutherland is particularly adept at this sort of role , where he must portray a character whose morality is , at first , uncertain to the audience . As is so often the case with Sutherland 's characters , we must ask " is he a villian [ in this case , a minor one ] , or a hero ? " This is a disturbing story , intelligently told , about the incompetence and fearful bureaucracy in the old Soviet Union that impeded the efforts of extremely competent people . As Sutherland 's character wryly notes , " The measure of a bureaucracy is its ability not to make special exceptions " . The " committee meeting " ( between Rea and Sutherland 's characters ) after perestroika is enforced , with its revelations , has enormous emotional impact . You can feel the suffering of the dedicated people who labored in that system . The handful of dramatic scenes portraying victims ' family members adds emotional resonance to the impact of the story . This is seldom a feature of a film with this sickening subject matter , but effectively reminds us that the victims had lives , and were loved . This is a sad , but very important film , which deserved its showcase on Canada 's History Television .
neg	In spite of its impressive cast and crew pedigree Gingerbread Man crumbles early and often . The plot is unrealistically convoluted , the actors sport bad accents and director Robert Altman 's participation amounts to collecting a pay check . Once again he has assembled an impressive cast ( Like Woody Allen , everyone wants to work with Altman)that this time around to the letter is miscast . But that 's only part of the problem . Kenneth Branagh is Rick Magruder a high powered Georgia lawyer who in the film 's heavy handed opening scenes manages to get himself preposterously seduced by a mysterious catering company waitress who convinces him she is in grave danger from an ex - husband and a loony dad . With red flags everywhere the astute lawyer plods on even managing to get his children in harms way . Fights of gun and fist follow along with a requisite car chase and if that 's not enough there 's a hurricane thrown in for the ridiculous finale . Branagh plays MacGruder with a mealy and unconvincing Southern accent . Running around in a trench coat in all kinds of weather he 's blind to the obvious in order to keep the story going . Hipster Bob Downey Jr. is every bit as bad as a P.I. but with a little more emphasis on the bad accent . Robert Duvall as the old man is Boo Radely all growed up en crazier than a bed bug serving some thick slices of ham but at least his twang is plausible . The female leads ( Embeth Davidtz , Darryl Hannah , Famkhee Jansen)are lean leggy and unemotive . Even the celebrity lawyers doing cameos ( Vernon Jordan ) are wooden with the few throw away lines they have . In addition to paying little attention to his actors , Altman 's mise en scene dripping with Spanish moss is murky and shapeless , his action scenes comic book . It lacks his offbeat touches and observations ( he does inform the viewer that the Stars and Bars still wave in Georgia)that make a well done Altman so unique . Unfortunately , Gingerbread Man is Altman at his worst , even if the pay is the same .
pos	This movie is great . Now , I do tend to like my films heavy on the story and dialogue , but now and then , something like Moonwalker comes along , and it 's watchable , despite numerous flaws . This film is no more than a highly entertaining Michael Jackson advertisement . Beginning with sickly video set to ' Man in the Mirror ' a montage listing his achievements , and bits and bobs from his career , it goes through all the highs of his life , then crashes down into a really , really entertaining segment which acts as a funny music video for ' Bad ' and ' Speed Demon ' , following the adventures of MJ as he runs from manic stop - motion fans , and finally dancing against a rabbit costume . The stop motion is n't that bad as some would have you believe . It 's passable . Then we see the great video for ' Leave me alone ' , and straight into the main feature . Yes , the plot is laughable . Very laughable . We see Michael walk out of a building , then get shot at by thousands of troops . Then we hit flashback , showing MJ and three children stumbling upon an underground lair . ' Mr Big ' ( Joe Pesci ) is the nefarious villain who has a plan to get every child in the world hooked on ' drugs ' ( no specifics are mentioned ) at an early age . MJ and the little girl he is with get caught , then chased ... yada yada yada . The plot is n't really the important part . We get two very cool sequences where MJ turns into a car , then a robot - spaceship thing , and of course , the amazing ' Smooth Criminal ' sequence . It 's a so - so film , but it is fantastic for anyone who likes MJ . It has most of his greatest hits , and some cool little bits , and some quite good special effects ( the Robot / Spaceship sequence in particular ) Worth it , especially seen as though you can pick it up for about a quid on ebay . It 'll keep the kids quiet for a couple of hours , as well as most 20 somethings who were kids when it was first released .
neg	Wow , what a snoozer . Definately one of bacon 's worst films . The bad acting coupled with a formulatic , if not incredulous , script make me yearn for time I wasted on viewing this on cable television back . Not really much I can say about it , a basketball scout gets too attached to the person he 's recruiting , who happens to belong to a tribe that happens to be on the verge of war which happens to be decided by ( spoiler ) a basketball game . Grade : F+
pos	I dug out from my garage some old musicals and this is another one of my favorites . It was written by Jay Alan Lerner and directed by Vincent Minelli . It won two Academy Awards for Best Picture of 1951 and Best Screenplay . The story of an American painter in Paris who tries to make it big . Nina Foch is a sophisticated lady of means and is very interested in helping him , but soon finds she loves the guy . Meanwhile Gene Kelly falls for lovely damsel , Leslie Caron . His main dancing partner , and I must say they are fantastic together on the floor and otherwise . Famous French singer Georges Guietary sings , too . So if you like good smooth dancing and fun filled scenes filled with Oscar Levant 's nimble piano fingers , the songs of George Gershwyn will live on forever in this colorful gem . 8/10
neg	I watched this immediately after seeing HILLSIDE CANNIBALS so anything would have been an improvement . On top of that it stops me from comparing ZOMBI 3 to 28 DAYS LATER and its sequel . Unfortunately the more I watched it the more I realised how well made Danny Boyle 's original was and how much this movie influenced 28 WEEKS LATER   One ca n't help noticing how much the 28 franchise has dated this type of Italian horror movie . I was totally convinced ZOMBI 3 must have been made in 1980 or 1981 at the very latest - In which case I would have called my summary 28 YEARS LATER ( Geddit ? ) - but was n't until I came to this page to find it was released in 1988 . All the production values scream that it 's a low budget splatter flick from the very early part of that decade . I might have enjoyed this movie as a fifteen year old schoolboy in 1982 as would have my peers but not now   Much of the problem involves a lack of internal continuity . For example some of the zombies shuffle about with the pace of a snail while others can run very fast and posses self awareness which leads to a ridiculous end scene involving a DJ . Likewise some can be killed by a kick to the face while others remain alive even if they 've had their head chopped off , wait till you see the fridge scene , you might just die laughing . Even the serious characters suffer from this type of contrived sloppy scripting where a character suddenly reveals he 's a helicopter pilot which leads me to ask why the army have been employing him to drive jeeps for a career   Obviously you 're reminded of the earlier film THE CRAZIES which also reminded me of the later 28 films . Bunch of terrorists break in to scientific base leading to all sorts of disaster with the military being the bad guys trying to kill both the infected and the survivors and long before the ending you 'll have worked out that basically everyone dies . The problem with this is you 'll instantly be reminded of how the British franchise did it so much better on a bigger budget . Not just that but the 28 franchise will appeal to a thinking audience who may have little interest in the average horror movie . ZOMBI 3 will appeal to no one but a hardcore splatter audience
pos	This movie has everything that makes a bad movie worth watching - sloppy editing , little to no continuity , insane dialog , bad ( you might even say non - existent ) acting , pointless story lines , shots that go on FAR too long ... and it 's perfect for MST3K - style riffing , not to mention the " Corpse Eaters Drinking Game " : Scribble on forms ... take a shot - Sign your name ... take a shot - Catch a bad Foley edit ... take many , many shots . The only reason I did n't rate it higher than 8 is because there 's not enough gratuitous nudity and because despite its insane badness , it 's only an hour long - hell , a movie like this should have been at least 20 - 30 minutes longer !
neg	What horrible writing and acting . No personality . What , you ca n't make a good movie with a single character ? Hmm , it was done in Castaway with self dialog . So this kid goes on a trip to see his father . The kid , Jason , takes a plane and the pilot has a heart attack and dies mid - flight . So the kid crashes in a lake and survives . Then he runs around , surviving in the wilderness until he gets rescued . During that time he fights a bear twice . The first time he fights it off in the lake . The second time he makes a spear out of a branch and spears the bear . Two shots of fake blood spurting out of the bear 's chest reminded me of Monty Python 's " The Holy Grail " . Also the kid decides to kick a porcupine with predictable results . Gag .
pos	This movie is a very realistic view of a police squad in a small german town as seen through the eyes of a woman recruit . She brings her way of dealing with the law , which means more than simple convictions . The strong performance of the main character , supported by good dialogues makes this flick very enjoyable .
neg	Loved Part One , The Impossible Planet , but whoops , what a disappointment part two ' The Satan Pit ' is . The cliffhanger of something apparently rising out of the pit was - nothing coming out of the pit . Then ages spent crawling round air vents to pad out the story , the Beast a roaring thing empty of intelligence , so no Doctor / villain confrontation I 'd been anticipating . The TARDIS is somehow inside the pit despite the pit not being open till long after the TARDIS fell through the planet crust . And finally another ready made solution which existed for no logical reason - I mean , why not plunge the Beast into the Hole as soon as the pit opened ? Why not plunge him in all those years ago instead of imprisoning him anyway . Why not - I could go on but I 've lost interest ...
pos	Oftentimes , films of this nature come across as a mixed bag of great work along with slight drivel to fill the runtime . Whether it be the big name support or the project itself , Paris je t'aime never falls into this realm . I believe I can truly say that the movie as a whole is better than its parts . Between the wonderful transitions and the fantastic ending sequence , merging characters together in one last view of love in Paris , I think the film would have suffered if any cog was removed . True , there are definitely a few standouts that overshadow the rest , but in the end I have a lasting image , even if just a split second of each short vignette . Love takes many forms , and the talent here rises to the occasion , to surprise and move the audience through shear poetry and elegance of the emotion 's many facets . Quartier des Enfants Rouges : Maggie Gyllenhaal surprises as a drug - addled actress shooting in Paris and meeting with her dealer . The reveal at its conclusion leaves you a bit off balance as the infatuation between the two changes hands . Quatier Latin : Ben Gazzara and Gena Rowlands ( recreating a relationship from an old Cassavettes film ? ) bring some great sharp wit and sarcasm as they meet to discuss their impending divorce . What of their conversation is true and what is just to anger the other , it is all enjoyable , leaving a smile on your face . Quais de Seine : Director Gurinder Chadha gives us a touching portrait of love existing beyond religious and racial differences . It is a sweet little story of shy love between two people obviously feeling a connection , but unable to quite vocalize it . Tour Eiffel : I will admit to being disappointed that Sylvain Chomet did not get an animated sequence together , however , this live action tale of mimes falling in love at a Paris jail has the same quirky nature as his film Les Triplettes de Belleville . Tuileries : The Coen Brothers stick to their strange sense of humor and deliver some fine laughs . Steve Buscemi really shines and sells the performance without speaking a word . His facial reactions to the verbal abuse of a disgruntled Frenchman are priceless . Bastille : Here is a heartbreaking portrait of a couple about out of love only to have it come back in the face of tragedy . Sergio Castellitto and Miranda Richardson a moving as the couple dealing with trouble and finding how strong the bond of true love is . Pére - Lachaise : A surprisingly funny little tale from horror master Wes Craven . A little Oscar Wilde humor can add levity to any relationship . Parc Monceau : Alfonso Cuarón looks to be practicing the amazing long - takes he perfects in Children of Men with this tale of two people in love , walking down the street . As Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier eventually come into close - up view , we also find the true context of their conversation of " forbidden love . " Porte de Choisy : A very surreal look into the glamour of Paris . This is probably the most odd entry , but so intriguing that you ca n't look away from the craziness that ensues . Do not anger your Asian beautician , whatever you do . Pigalle : An interesting look at a relationship undergoing a role - play that seems to have been stagnant for years . A little variety from Bob Hoskins is necessary to fire kindled . Quartier de la Madeleine : Even vampires in Paris can find love amongst the feeding hours . I do n't know whether to be happy for Elijah Wood as a result or not . Beautifully shot and muted to allow the vibrancy of the blood red , this short is strange , but then so is love . 14th arrondissement : Leave it to Alexander Payne 's odd sense of humor to really add some depth to this voice - over story told of an American in Paris to find what love is . Her harsh , uneducated French is a very stark contrast to the authentic accents we 've been listening to until this pointjust off - kilter enough to be both funny and totally true to the story . Montmartre : An interesting introduction into the proceedings . Paris can be a city reviled for everyday activities like finding a parking spot , yet when love is discovered , it will take its prisoner anywhere to continue the journey . Loin du 16éme : Catalina Sandino Moreno brilliantly shows what love for a child is through her subtle performance as the tale is bookended by her singing to a young child , yet totally different each time . Place des Fetes : My favorite tale of the bunch . Seydou Boro and Aïssa Maïga are simply fantastic . The cyclical nature of the story and how fate brings the two characters together twice in order for Boro to finally ask her for coffee is tough to watch . Sometimes love at your final moment is enough to accept one 's leaving of this earth . Place des Victoires : One of the best stories about a mother trying to cope with the death of her young son . Juliette Binoche is devastating as the mother , desperate for one last glimpse of her son , and Willem Dafoe is oddly perfect as the cowboy who allows her the chance . Faubourg Saint - Denis : Sometimes one needs to think he has lost love to accept that he has not been fully invested in the relationship . Melchior Beslon reminisces , trying to find where they went wrong through a series of sharp , quick cuts from his meeting Natalie Portman to eventually " seeing " how much he needs her . Le Marais : Leave it to Gus Van Sant to show us a story about the gap in communication and understanding as his films almost always deal with some form of alienation . His photographer from Elephant is an American working in Paris who is the catalyst for Gaspard Ulliel 's artist ramblings of love and soul mates . Sometimes one does n't need to know what is being said to understand what is going on in the pauses .
neg	Witchcraft / Witchery / La Casa 4/ and whatever else you wish to call it . How about .. Crud . A gathering of people at a Massachusetts island resort are besieged by the black magic powers of an evil witch killing each individual using cruel , torturous methods . Photographer Gary(David Hasselhoff)is taking pictures for Linda(Catherine Hickland whose voice and demeanor resemble EE - YOR of the Winnie the Poo cartoon ) , a virgin studying witchcraft , on the island resort without permission . Rose Brooks(Annie Ross , portraying an incredibly rude bitch)is interested in perhaps purchasing the resort and , along with husband Freddie(Robert Champagne , who is always ogling other women much younger than him ) , pregnant daughter Jane(Linda Blair)and grandson Tommy(Michael Manchester , who just looks bored throughout , probably wanting to watch Sesame Street instead of starring in this rubbish ) , go by boat to the resort being treated to a look at the property by Realtor Tony Giordano 's son Jerry(Rick Farnsworth ) , obviously a pup in the business getting his feet wet . Along with these folks is architect Leslie(Leslie Cumming , whose character is a nympho)who might help Rose re - design the resort . The boat 's captain is killed by The Lady in Black(Hildegard Knef , wearing her make - up and lip - stick extra thick)and a storm is brewing . The boat drives off by itself( .. guided by the invisible power of The Lady in Black , I guess)with everyone stuck in the decrepit resort , which is in dire need of repairs . Most of the victims , before meeting their grisly fates are carried through a type of red wormhole whose vortex leads to another dimension( .. perhaps a type of hell or something)where they are tortured by these fiends dressed in raggedy clothes with a crummy visage . One victim has her mouth sown before being hung upside down in a chimney , roasted as the others light the fireplace . One poor soul is tortured by harsh twistings of rope wrapped tightly around her flesh before being found hanging from the snout of a swordfish penetrating through her neck . One fellow is slowly suffocating as his veins bulge( .. and bleed ) and neck 's blood vessels burst squirting in Hasselhoff 's face ! One fellow is crucified with nails hammered into his hands before being hung upside down over an open flame . Blair 's pregnant victim becomes possessed with her hair standing on end speaking in another woman 's voice . One is raped by this demonic man with a " diseased " mouth as the hellish hobos stand nearby gleefully cheering . The film , despite it 's excesses , is mostly dull fodder for those who really wish to see the lowest point in the careers of Hasselhoff and Blair , who deserve better than this . Almost unbearable at times , building little - to - no suspense . Clumsy execution of the death sequences which look cheap and laughable . Sure some gore is okay , but most of the film shows victims after they 've been run through the ringer . We do get a chance to see pregnant women( .. who look exactly like stuntmen in costume with bad wigs ) jumping out three story windows . Oh , and The Lady in Black 's reflected face often pops up on inanimate objects for characters to see . Tommy has a little Sesame Street recorder which tapes The Lady in Black 's mumbo jumbo chants , obviously used for later . For some reason , The Lady in Black likes to visit little Tommy . He 's not at all scared of her , for Tommy 's just too bored to show any expression on his face , much less fear . Need I say more ? This one 's a real stinker . Ugh .
pos	Cypher is a movie well worth seeing because it 's not the run - of - the - mill Sci - Fi flick . The artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what 's going on . The close - up camera view is how the director keeps the plot illusive . The sci - fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie . The technology used in the movie is n't overly impressive , however , the director makes good use of the props .   The character development is intentionally shallow . The main character , Jeremy Northam , decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage . It 's up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and it 's the enigma that keeps the audience interested right to the very end .
neg	I had a video of the thing . And I think it was my fourth attempt that I managed to watch the whole film without drifting off to sleep . It 's slow - moving , and the idea of a mid - Atlantic platform , which may have been revolutionary at the time , is now just a great big yawnaroony . Apart from Conrad Veidt , the rest of the cast are pretty forgettable , and it is only in the action towards the end that things get really interesting . When the water started to spill big - time it even , on one occasion , woke me up . But give the man his due . No one could hold a cigarette like Conrad Veidt . He does n't wedge it between his index and middle fingers like the lesser mortals . He holds it in his fingers , while showing us the old pearly - browns . There are a few scenes in this film where the smoke drifts up to heaven against a dark background , and looks very artistically done . But it does not say much about this film if all that impresses you is the tobacco smoke .
pos	If you were brought up on a diet of gameshows you 'll understand that you gradually need a bigger and better fix . Well , in the world of the Running Man , your needs will be sated . For in this game show , prisoners compete for freedom , and the ultimate prize - their very lives . I loved this film . It was such a parody on the mind - numbing tripe that we watch on a daily basis . It is n't one of Schwarzenegger 's best performances , but on the whole it is a very good film . The underlying idea that Television Corporations will one day be the " real " rulers of the planet is very believable , and is very well portrayed in this film . Of course there are the usual Arnie one - liners , my favourite is when he is about to be catapulted into the gamezone , the gameshow host asks " Any last words ? " Arnie says : " Yeah , I 'll be back " but the host quips " Only in a re - run " and presses the eject button . I give this film a 10 for sheer originality . I must have watched it 30 or more times . The only film apart from the Die Hard series that I watched this often ! ! In short , do not for a minute think that you own the T.V. - It owns you .....
neg	this movie was banned in england ? why ? tom savini , george romero , dario argento , lucio fulci and others had done far worse before and have continued to so since ... this movie has all the basic elements of a decent 70s or early 80 's horror film . good looking girls ( who ca n't act to save their lives , by the way ) , a terrible lightning storm with a torrential downpour , a scythe , a crazy brother wandering around the family estate , and actually a pretty damn good twist at the end . but banned ? seriously . when the English parliament banned this movie , the italians probably laughed their collective asses off at how backwards and prudish the brits really were . there was maybe two minutes of total screen time devoted to the violence and gore ( which was greatly underdone ) . there was nudity but no sex although allusions to sex were made , obviously . but absolutely nothing worthy of being banned . i would like to see what could have been done if the filmmakers had a decent budget to work with . as it stands , the film is entertaining , but the lack of picture and sound quality take away from the end result . banned ... what a joke ...
pos	These two men went thru hell and beyond and have produced the movie that conveys the terror that many did not survive . This is definitely a movie about survival , but not without it 's touching moments . The finest piece of work I have seen documenting the 9/11/01 tragedy of New York City .
neg	In his 1966 film " Blow Up " , Antonioni had his hero question truth against a backdrop of British youth protesters . By setting such questions against a fabric of hippie youth movements , Antonioni questioned , intentionally or not , the effectiveness of these organisations . How can you fight for a cause when what you think is true may actually be a lie ? On the flip side , the film said that we must fight and actively challenge what we see precisely because others may be deceiving us with false images and false truths . Though the hippie aspects were the most tacky parts of " Blow Up " , they created a nice texture and gave the film more meaning than it might otherwise have had . It was a very cautionary and mature little film . With " Zabriskie Point " Antonioni throws away all the ambiguities and subtleties of " Blow Up " and goes full blown hippie . The result is a film awash with bad metaphors , stupid ideas and heavy handed storytelling . How could somebody , who across his career displayed such restraint and intelligence , make something so silly ?   The film opens with a nice series of close ups , as we watch a group of radicals discussing the meaning of revolution . Suddenly one man ( Mark ) gets up and leaves . He hates the rigid and ordered nature of revolution . He recognises that , though revolutionaries fight for freedom , to bind oneself to such a militant cause is to effectively give your freedom away . And so like Jack Nicholson in " The Passenger " , Mark just wants to be free . As such , Mark buys a gun and goes solo . He takes orders from no one . When police raid his university campus Mark shoots a guy and runs away . He then flees to a nearby airfield , steals a small private plane and flies out to the desert . Antonioni treats the desert as a peaceful utopia , and contrasts it with the ruthlessly capitalist cities , with their billboards and hollow modern appliances . He sees the desert as a sort of Garden of Eden . In the desert , Mark meets Daria and quickly falls in love . Antonioni then gives us a ridiculous sex scene in which hundreds of hippies have sex in the sand . Free from the constraints of modern life , these tree - huggers and student radicals can now celebrate their individualism by humping in the sun . The film ends with Mark dying and Daria fantasising about blowing up the mansions and stately homes of the rich capitalists who killed him . It 's Antonioni 's challenge to his audience . Pick up the guns , pickets and explosives , he says . Tear the walls down before they cage you in ! Of course the film had no effect on its audience . They recognised " Zabriskie Point " as being just another self centred commercial attempt at being radical . A sort of commodified radicalism . It felt untruthful and tame . Thematically the film is pretty stupid . Antonioni basically says that if you are unhappy with the modern world , and the fat cats who exploit you , you should either flee to the desert ( Mark ) or actively fight the system ( Daria ) . That 's all well and good . But though artists constantly warn us of such dystopian nightmares , they 're all mostly unable to show us how to effectively administer change . Like the end of " Fight Club " , nihilism and violence achieve nothing . In the real world , social change tends to be instigated by humble inventors , spurred ahead by minor technological advancements . I mean , what liberated women more than contraceptives ? 3/10 - A very bad film . The problem is , Antonioni does not really believe in rebellion . He is a quiet and contemplative man . An introvert who seems to have made an extroverted film simply to garner more adoration from the counterculture who embraced his earlier film , " Blow Up " . As such , " Zabrinskie Point " comes across as a very pretentious and stupid film . It 's essentially a 50 year old man say " Look at me , I 'm a daring rebel ! " There are many films in which the audience is encouraged to fight " the system " , but they all fall into one of four categories . In the first category you have films like " Network " , " Cool Hand Luke " , " Cuckoo 's Nest " and " Spartacus " . These all show that the lives of freedom fighters all end in failure , though in each case the " spirit of revolution " survives . The message is that you can not effect change , but by dying or failing , the optimistic notion of change survives through martyrdom . Essentially we must keep on failing rather than give up hope . Then you have films like " Fight Club " , " Zabriskie Point " and " Falling Down " , which simply encourage you to explode . Tear it all down . Blow it all up . Everything is a lie , so you might as well go out guns blazing . These films are borne out of angry , reactionary feelings , rather than any sort of common sense . Then you have the " flight rather than fight " category . Terrence Malick and Antonioni are the masters of this genre . Films like " The Passenger " , " Red Desert " and " Badlands " show human beings running from worlds they do not like and forging islands or peaceful havens for themselves . Both directors are pessimists , in that Malick has his islands destroyed and Antonioni has his islands offering no sense of happiness or solution . Then you have the fourth category . Films like Donnersmarck 's " The Lives of Others " , Ashby 's " Bound For Glory " and Kubrick 's " A Clockwork Orange " , treat artists as a force of change and rebellion . In these dystopian worlds , in which everyone is content to be a slave to the state , it is the unbridled creativity and freedom of will of the artist / criminal who keeps the system in check . By simply existing outside of the herd , you create waves . Your comments , actions and critical eye , challenges the status quo . As such , Donnersmarck 's film has novelists and artists undermining Nazi Germany , whilst Kubrick has Alex the artist / criminal fighting Nazi droogs , painting the town in blood and sperm .
pos	this is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue . what dialogue there is appears in word baloons as it would in the manga . the plot of this is existent but only vaguely accounted for . there is an issue of the manga on which this is based available in english in the blast books collection , ' comics underground japan ' , and it has actual captioned dialogue that explains the plot a bit more than here . i recommend checking that volume out if you liked this , as it explains some of the " plot " of the movie , which is otherwise inexplicable . animation wise this is pretty decent , good unintrusive use of computers and the images are for the most part realized well . it jumps in and out of episodes , as the characters , a cat and his brain - dead older sister cat wander in and out of a series of odd images : a boat , a circus , a desert . for a mere half hour they go through a number of semi - plots and settings , which leads me to believe that the director chose a number of issues of the long - running manga to adapt at random , but primarilly selected visually . knowing what 's going on might somewhat increase appreciation . this reminds me mostly of the kind of stuff they used to play on the mtv show , cartoon sushi , in particular a short that features a cat chasing a man 's severed butt - cheek around the house . only in this case the cats resemble hello kitty more and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and a number of other themes [ though not all that easy to tell what 's going on ] . the dvd of this has director 's commentary and a " making of " features , but i ca nt comment on those because i did nt get around to them . i 'm giving this a 8/10 for now , here is nt much to compare it to in anime , and i hope for more like this .
neg	The worlds largest inside joke . The world 's largest , most exclusive inside joke . Emulating the brash and ' everyman ' humor of office space , this film drives the appeal of this film into the ground by making the humor such that it would only be properly appreciated by legal secretaries writing books . The audience is asked to assume the unfamiliar role of a legal secretary , and then empathize with the excruciatingly dumb protagonist . The entire film is centered on the legal secretary finding free time , listening to music and writing a novel while working . These are his goals . You ca n't imagine the slap in the face it is to the audience when ( around halfway through ) they find out he has had a job which fit all three of those criteria , but then gives it UP ! The director and screenwriter ( Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth ) completely remove the audience 's motivation to empathize or even find entertaining a protagonist that has previously thrown away that which he is complaining about the lack thereof . Apart from that major stumbling block , the legal secretary insider humor fails because they must be explained explicitly to the audience each time they happen . Without these asides , the audience would n't have noticed anything particularly strange . Humor is only effective if it does n't need to be thoroughly explained to the audience what is funny .
pos	If it 's action and adventure you want in a movie , then you 'd be best advised to look elsewhere . On the other hand , if it 's a lazy day and you want a good movie to go along with that mood , check out " The Straight Story . " Richard Farnsworth puts on a compelling performance as the gentle and gentlemanly Alvin Straight , in this true story of Alvin 's journey on a riding mower across three states to see his estranged brother who has had a stroke . Farnsworth is perfect in this role , as he travels his long and winding road , making friends of strangers and doling out lots of grandfatherly type advice about family along the way . The story moves along as slowly as the riding mower , but somehow manages to keep the viewer watching , waiting for the next life lesson Alvin 's going to offer . Stretch out on the couch , relax and enjoy . It 's the only way to watch this very good movie , which rates a 7/10 in my book .
neg	Every Sunday , a trio of buds get together at a NYC diner to boast about their sexual conquests of the night before . Sometimes they 're joined by a newlywed ex - comrade and hoochie hunter who hangs on them like a puling barnacle . They 're unabashed horn dogs / corn dogs and Mia , who witnesses them on the prowl , decides that they need to be taught a lesson , dammit . Ergo , she 'll date and dump - why not ? All three of them !   Gasp . What a wild idea . What a radical , naughty gal . Women now have the right to date and sleep around as much as they want to . As much as men do , even !   There is one solitary laughable element in " Whipped " - namely the fact that not once , during the amigo 's detailed discussions of their bodily functions and the tantric talents of the bed partners they trash , do the other customers in the diner turn around and say , " Dude , we 're trying to EAT here . " Indeed , a heh - heh gag has an older lady eagerly weigh in on the useful sexual properties of certain beverages . A big fat Kermit the Frog " Sheesh " to that . It 's truly unfortunate that a buddy movie with a great setting , a smart , cute heroine and three possible pairings had to have such a cop - out ending . P.S. - 30 " whip - oosh " sound effects to the screenwriter for use of the phrase " You go , girl " . It was tired in 2000 , and it 's tired now . Save your time and watch some " Sex and the City " reruns ...
pos	I have recently seen this movie due to Jake 's recent success with Brokeback Mountain . I figured I would see the movies that I missed . I had no expectations going into the film so was astounded that I had missed this movie at all . It 's a gripping father and son tale , and it is also an underdog story . I even shed a tear at the finale of this wonderful tale . This movie appeals to all ages . The only reason I give it a 9 out of 10 is that it slows down a little in the middle , but it comes back strong in the end . The acting was great , the story was magnificent , and the cinematography was captivating given the setting of the film . GO SEE THIS MOVIE ! Rent it , buy it , watch it , LOVE IT ! I know I did !
neg	I 'm a fan of the series and have read all 7 books . I wanted to see this just to see how it was done . All i can say , is that the only people who should watch this are ones who have already read the series and are curious about it . Its pretty bad , and will turn you off reading them . Not to be mean , but Lucy is so ugly it detracts from the movie . Was she the directors daughter ? Seriously , I 'm sure the beavers in the movie were jealous of her teeth . She had an overbite that would put any beaver to shame . The movie just loses so much in translation . CS books do n't translate as easily as the Tolkein LOTR books , or even Harry Potter . One thing they did right ! Aslan ! very well done . Although the other human actors with painted faces ( beavers , wolf ) look silly , Aslan was really well done since it was not just a human actor walking around . ( i guess its like that old horse custume ? 2 people inside ? ) Also , i would be curious what kids think of this movie . Maybe they would enjoy it ? But as for adults , safe bet they wo nt , even if a CS fan .
pos	Sunday July 16 , 8:00pm The Castro , San Francisco " As a Southern colonel your make - up is very Indiana " The yammering gossips of Hollywood have managed to sling more than a little mud in Marion Davies direction over the years . That she had fame handed to her and was undeserving , is often speculated . Considering the mawkish dramas she was so often pushed into , this criticism would seem to have some validity . As a comedienne however , her star shone very brightly . Left to pursue a career in light comedy and slapstick she might have rivaled Mabel Normand . One of her better outings was King Vidor 's Show People ( 1928 ) , which survives and is so well known largely because MGM filled it with star cameos . This happy coincidence inadvertently saved what is surely among the best work of its two stars , Davies and that notorious Joe College wise - cracker , William Haines . Rumor has it Show People was loosely based on the life of Gloria Swanson , who began in Sennett comedies and rose to grand drama ( And do n't think she did n't spend the rest of her life reminding everyone ! ) with von Stroheim , Walsh and DeMille . Coincidentally , the comedy studios used in this film are the original digs Keystone had abandoned the year before ( Think of who worked there ! ) . Colonel Marmaduke Oldfish Pepper ( Dell Henderson ) drives his daughter Peggy ( Davies ) from Georgia to Hollywood to star in the movies . These two country hicks are unsuspecting fodder for incorrigible Billy Boone ( Haines ) , "  a custard pie artist  " who descends on their cafeteria table in an outrageously funny entrance ( watch for the bit with the noodle ) , and then helps Peggy land a part in his next picture . What she thinks is high drama turns out to be screwball , but a job is a job and Billy convinces her " . . all the stars have to take it on the chin  " . At the preview , Billy and Peggy bump into  .. Charlie Chaplin , who asks for her autograph ! She pushes the little fellow aside and a horrified Billy grabs the book and makes her sign . Chaplin climbs in his car and Billy tells Peggy who she s just snubbed , so naturally , she faints . It 's so very funny , considering Davies character is n't supposed to recognize this guy ! Peggy soon moves on to work at the High Art Studios , changes her name to ' Patricia Pepoire ' and leaves poor Billy behind . Davies does a wonderful send - up of a serious actress , with all the prerequisite fluttering eyelashes and quivering lips . Vidor throws in a parade of stars eating lunch in a long tracking shot ( and they 're all sitting shoulder to shoulder , facing the camera ! ) that includes Polly Moran ( Who 's also sensationally funny playing Davies ' maid ) , Louella Parsons ( one of the friendly vampires ) , Estelle Taylor , Claire Windsor Aileen Pringle , the comedy duo of Karl Dane ( with his arm in a sling ) and George K. Arthur ( pretending he 's stealing the silverware ) , Leatrice Joy ( amused by Arthur 's antics ) , Renee Adoree , Rod ( eating and smoking ) La Rocque , Mae Murray , John ( in a robe ) Gilbert ( who also appears driving through the MGM gates early in the picture ) , Norma ( eeeww ! ) Talmadge ( looking bitchy and aloof as usual ) and Patricia dressed like Marie Antoinette , sandwiched between Douglas Fairbanks ( as he does an amusing trick ) and William S. Hart ( protecting her from Doug ) . Billy runs into the High Art crew on location when the comedy troupe disrupts their filming , with predictably nutty results . Vidor even works himself into the final scene as the director of Peggy 's current production . Also worth noting are Harry Gribbon as the comedy director doing a great caricature of Eddie Sedgwick , Sidney Bracy as the dramatic director who ca n't get Peggy to cry for her screen test and then ca n't stop her once she does , and Paul Ralli as Andre , her dramatic love interest and a hilarious phony . When her character tries to ' act ' its as though Davies is poking fun at all the awful dramas she 'd been forced into and she 's brilliant doing it . While it 's true Show People is a hokey satire of the ' good ole days ' ten years hence , it remains a highly entertaining example of quality work from MGM , Irving Thalberg , and their tremendous wealth of assembled talent . What a shame so much has been lost . There are also far too many examples of great films like The Patsy ( 1928 ) , Vidor and Davies ' hugely successful comedy from earlier that same year , languishing in vaults when they could be seen and enjoyed .
neg	I do n't know what it is about this movie- director Sam Mraovich somehow messed up just about every little aspect in this movie . I would normally say that this is a movie that should not exist , but this movie may be the most important of all time . This movie should exist for the sole purpose of being without a doubt ' The Worst Movie Ever Made ' . I 've seen bad movies in my lifetime , but this somehow breaks what I considered bad into something much more hard to imagine . Everything in this movie is hilarious , but the single funniest thing is that Mraovich himself considers this to be a great movie . Oh wow ...
pos	My wife is a teacher and she is very familiar with the story , having read it to several of her classes . It never sounded all that interesting to me , though , and I bought the DVD figuring this would be a movie that would n't really be up my alley . The first half of the movie has a lot of set - up and I found myself thinking that I was right . It starts off a bit slow and I have to admit that I was a little bit bored - but curious enough to stay with it . Boy , am I glad I did because this ended up being a very satisfying and rewarding movie . I would most certainly watch this again ! The casting was very good . Since I have n't read the book , I ca n't vouch for accuracy , but I have to say that Jon Voight was truly delightful . You liked the characters you were supposed to like , hated the ones you were supposed to hate , and laughed at the ones that were supposed to be funny . I can see how some folks might not like this movie . It is tedious at times , especially in the beginning . All the flashbacks can be distracting ( though they are essential to the story ) . Once the story starts to come together at the end , though , I think you 're paid back in spades for your patience . When all is said and done , I think this is a very good movie - 8/10 .
neg	This movie fails miserably on every level . I have an idea , let 's take everyone involved in this movie and ship them into a hot zone in the middle east . Maybe if we 're lucky they 'll all be shot and killed and we wo n't have to ever have our time wasted by them again . Did I mention that I have never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my entire life ? My god , I ca n't think of anything I 've ever seen that was this bad . I 'd rather watch Ishtar 25 times in a row than sit through 10 minutes of this sorry excuse for a film . If I ever happen to meet anyone who was involved in this film , I 'll spit in their face and then beat them senseless . That 's my two cents .
pos	I first saw this in the movie theater when it came out , and the crowd was really into the movie which made the experience all the more fun . This is a great cast of characters , many big names in it , a few of which were not as recognized then as they are now . I think it 's a great idea if you follow any of these actors , or have loved them in other movies , to add it to your watched list . Some of the scenes actually remind me of the type of well - done comedy as in The Birdcage or even The Clue , kind of odd spontaneous - appearing comedy , with some really professional delivery from these beloved actors . The movie did a great job at giving you some insight , perhaps even very realistic , into the culture of a daytime soap .
neg	Hated it . If you believe that everyone in the South is dumb , morally bankrupt , stupid , violent , a religious nut , or a child molester , then this film may be for you . Everyone is poor and seemingly ignorant . In one scene , two older men are talking in a general store and one mentions that he had molested a set of sisters before they could tie their shoes . The man seemed proud of his actions , and the other man clearly took it as a normal part of life . Very nice . A teenage girl walks the back roads looking for her sister and no one offers to help her -- despite an obvious limp and lack of food or water ( no backpack , etc . ) . Strathairn 's character is not only thoroughly disgusting and slimy , but he is shown to be a religious believer who ( typical for Hollywood ) reflects the vile nature of Christians . A scene in the movie is highly reminiscent of the end of Cape Fear ( the one with DeNiro ) -- Bible verses being spouted by the bad guy . I am from the Great Northwest , but found this film offensive because of the wonderful people I know who are from NC , WV , AL , MS , KY , TN , etc .
pos	This film has a special place in my heart , as when I caught it the first time , I was teaching adult literacy . It rang very true to me and even an outstanding student I had at the time . There are scenes which make you gulp with sudden emotion , and those which even put a smile on your face through sheer identification with the characters and their situation .   Excellent performances by Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro that rank with their best work , a great turn by a young Martha Plimpton , an inspiring story line , and a haunting musical score makes for a most enjoyable and rewarding experience .
neg	I hated this crap , every Friday as part of tgif it was on , and consistently sucked big time with stupidity each and every week . If you want to see something funny go watch " No On Would Tell " Starring Candice Cameron and Fred Savage , it really is hilarious , shows exactly why no one ever goes on to a good film career after doing a terrible TV show . This show really makes me sick , I hate those kids , and bob saget needs to go jump off a bridge for ever making this crapfest . I 've seen funner stuff everywhere else but here . I AHet writing 10 lines ! Watch ' full house ' to see the least humanity has to offer in the way of arts and entertainment .
pos	" The Straight Story " is a truly beautiful movie about an elderly man named Alvin Straight , who rides his lawnmower across the country to visit his estranged , dying brother . But that 's just the basic synapsis ... this movie is about so much more than that . This was Richard 's Farnworth 's last role before he died , and it 's definitely one that he will be remembered for . He 's a stubborn old man , not unlike a lot of the old men that you and I probably know .   " The Straight Story " is a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lives . It will reach down and touch some part of you , at least if you have a heart , it will .
neg	Unreal " movie " , what were these people on ? ? A mix of French Upstairs Downstairs , mating horses , porn ( not suggested , its pretty full on for a film ) & bestiality with a bit of Benny Hill music & chase scenes thrown in , its sounds crazy & its even more so to watch . * * spoiler * * It plods along in a tedious fashion for quite a while , .... then a Lamb does a runner , prompting woman in period dress to run off after it , she goes into the woods where she is set upon by an erect " penis " attached to a man in a bear / rat manky suit , I put it like that as its obvious the " penis " is in charge & gets way too much screen time , ejaculating for the most of it , anyway , in a nutshell , it turns out she liked a bit of bear / rat tadger & that s about it , the rest is just padding . * * end spoiler * * A film made to shock & offend , thus getting talked about , any publicity is good publicity I suppose , a waste of time really , but the " main event " has to be seen to be believed , its hard to imagine that anyone thought it was a good idea as they filmed it .
pos	I have a feeling that the Warners Bros Depression - era musicals are going to become a lot more pertinent in the next couple of years . Yes , we are in the economic doldrums ( or have you been living under a rock ) and times look bleak . But we always have the movies as a way to escape our troubles . In the 30 's , film - going was hugely popular even at the height of economic gloom . " Footlight Parade ( 1933 ) " was one such film that audiences flocked to . While this Lloyd Bacon - directed musical does n't quite capture the social issues of the time as " Gold Diggers of 1933 ( 1933 ) " does , it 's still a wonderful showcase of talent . We have to wait until the end of the film for the three centrepiece Busby Berkely extravaganza numbers , but boy , are they worth waiting for me . Yes , little Ruby Keeler is a terrible singer and actress , and her tapping is so - so , but Busby 's magical " By A Waterfall " whisks her , and what seems to be a hundred other chorus girls , into a dizzying water wonderland . Of course Busby 's numbers could never really be performed on a stage ( they defy limits of gravity , for one thing ) , and they contrast terrifically with the realism of the tough , wisecracking non - musical scenes . And " Footlight " also has James Cagney in at the one of his all - too - few musicals ( really , what could n't this man do ? ) . He even gets to take over from the leading man , don sailor garb and fawn over sexpot Shanghai Lil ( who is really little Ruby in China - girl wig!).He co - stars with Joan Blondell , his adorable , adoring secretary who Cagney somehow overlooks in favour of other women ( until the final reel , that is ) . Apparently Blondell was the only other woman who Cagney loved apart from his wife . And you can see the mutual adoration in every scene .
neg	The acting was horrendous as well as the screenplay . It was poorly put together and made you almost want to laugh at the several terribly acted out murder scenes . The ending was even worse . Everyone kept dying , but somehow the ending made it look like everything was perfectly OK ! They did not give enough history about the obsession the teacher had , etc . The movie needed more time to perhaps develop a better storyline . The only reason I give this 3/10 is that I kind of feel bad for the young actors . They needed better coaching . They could have really made this an OK film , but the screenplay and acting failed miserably .
pos	As a former 2 time Okinawan Karate world champion , I like movies about sacrifice for sport . But this movie is about so much more . This movie is so good and so deep . I have recently been plagued by very serious injury and pretty much a disastrous lack of passion . Almost lights out for me . And this silly little movie touched me so deep that like out of a daze it reminded me about what life is supposed to be about . This is a movie about living . Living your life for yourself and respect for others . Empowerment . God , bless " Bend it like Beckham " I believe it is a true gem .
neg	This is a truly terrible film . I 'm only writing this so that some people somewhere are put off watching it . If I have stopped one person from wasting some of their precious life watching this film I shall die happy . Unutterably dull , although since it stars Al Pacino I was fooled into thinking that at any moment something interesting was going to happen . Then the credits rolled , and I realised I had been completely fooled into watching this unbelievable drivel . I can not believe that this film has achieved as high a score as it has at IMDb ( over 5 stars when I last saw the voting ) . Are you people voting ironically ? Please , please , please do not watch this film !
pos	Audiences today will probably watch a film like Ossessione and not really consider how unprecedented it was during the time when it came out . The structure of the film really divorces from sap - happy Hollywood conventionsas well as other major theatrical elements . It relies more upon depicting reality in a very grim and sober light . Films of this naturethe neo - realist filmswere made to reflect the darkness felt during post - World War II times . Ossessione tackles some fairly provocative issues that were probably unseen on screen prior to the war , including : adultery , conspiracy , murder , pregnancy , etc . Aside from the one crane shot and certain musical swelling moments , the film aesthetic is very raw and gritty : shot on - location , uses natural lighting and most likely non - popular actors . All of these elements helped convey the issues explored in the film , yielding the following theme : Negative karmic repercussions will haunt those who deliberately act immorally . The two leadsGino and Giovannaare polar opposites , yet both carry the mentality : we 're bored and we want to be entertained . Gino is a drifter ; a lone traveler who embraces life and its constant fluctuations . Giovanna is a bored house - wife cemented in the familiarly of marital permanence : she does n't want to leave her home and husband , but would rather remain where she is because it 's safer . Gino 's lifestyle represents the ideal lifestyle Giovanna craves ; the only difference is that she 's too afraid to live it herselfthat 's why she falls in love with Gino : he represents everything she wants but does n't have the courage to get . She wants to live in a world free from the monotony of living with her corpulent husbandGino is the perfect ticket into that world . The affair that ensues between the two most likely left audiences back in the 40 's feeling somewhat uneasy . I mean , films prior to the neo - realist age never showed such scandalous behavior on screen before . To say the least it was probably a bit alarming . In conjunction with the theme , the neo - realist style helps show the negative repercussions of adulterous behavior . Succinctly put , adulterous behavior ( as shown in the film ) leads to depressing and ultimately deadened lives . When Gino and Giovanna conspire with each other to " eliminate " Giovanna 's husband , karma comes to haunt them like a plague after the deed is done . They return to their home : the atmosphere is dark and biting ( as can be expected from the neo - realist style ) . They are not happy ; they 're actually more depressed . They thought that by eliminating Giovanna 's husband that they 'd live happier lives , but they were duped . The film ends with Giovanna 's deathit being in karmic similitude of her husband 's death . I think this is a very satisfying ending for several reasons . Here 's why . There 's a lot of talk as to whether or not evil should be depicted on screen , and if so , to what extent . I think depicting evil is very necessary if and only if the evil depicted is not being glorified , but rather shows what negative consequences evil actions have . As the subtext of Ossessione asks , is adultery and murder evil ? I think the film eagerly responds yes ! The adulterous behavior between the two reveals how unhappy they are . Ironically though , towards the end of the film when they seem to be healed of their depression and are seen basking in each other 's arms inside the car , the author of the film shows that their happiness is , in fact , a façade : the car crashes off the cliff and into the river , killing Giovanna ; the police arrest Gino . I think it was the author 's intention to say that even though people sometimes try and justify their immoral behavior , in the end karma will come back to haunt them . I agree . I think the two got what was coming to them because they both were incredibly selfishalways wanting instant gratification and not willing to endure through hard times . This was especially made clear after the first sign of difficulty that Gino and Giovanna experience in their relationship : he ca n't handle the pressure of living in Giovanna 's husband shadow , so he leaves Giovanna and sleeps with another girl . Such is typical of the insatiable , hedonistic personality . All in all , the film seemed very risky for its time . The audience , however , was prepared to see such a film because of the sobriety the war brought . Those pre - war , happy - go - lucky films were no longer being believed . Movie - going audiences were ready to see and contemplate difficult films with complex characters : they wanted to see characters whose lives were entangled in so - called ' sin ' because it was a reflection of their own life problems . Ossessione , then , acts as a great catalyst for where the future of film was heading . That is , a lot of the naturalism pieces we see today can be said to have been influenced by the neo - realist film movement .
neg	I was excited to hear that Cesar Montano had decided to make a movie in the Cebuano language . ( Not ' dialect ' as most Filipinos will incorrectly refer to it as . As Cebuano and Tagalog are as mutually unintelligible as French and Spanish are to each other . ) But I was greatly disappointed when i saw this movie . Being a Canadian , of Cebuano parents , I was optimistic about the revival of the Visayan film industry when I heard about this film . I was further excited to hear that it was n't another stupid action movie or melodrama as Filipinos love these types of movies . But alas , I was short - changed . Panaghoy serves as an ego trip for Cesar Montano . Montano of course plays the hero of the movie . And when I say ' hero ' I mean in the most stereotypical of manners ; his function is to win the heart of a girl and lead the Bol - anons to victory against the Japanese . His character has no depth or complexity . He just fits the hero mold . The rest of the characters are one dimensional ; they all fit their cookie cutter roles . I 'm all for slow - moving / meditative movies but this movie was just slow moving . It did n't really meditate on anything . Just because a movie is historically - themed , a drama and slow - moving does n't make it a well - made film . Particularly annoying is the American actor Philip Anthony . His performance was embarrassing . If Montano wanted to revive the Visayan film industry he should have really thought this through . He said he wanted to make Visayan movies that could compete at Cannes and Toronto etc . but really , this movie would have been booed and hissed at at such festivals . To get Visayan films into the mainstream consciousness he should have at least made a movie that would have attracted audiences , even if it meant sacrificing quality . Obviously he did n't think about or get information on what kind of movies garner awards at Cannes so an audience - attracting movie would have been at least a foot in the door . I 'm afraid now that Visayan movies will not be made for a long time again because of this movie . If ever I said to a Filipino that I want to see more Visayan movies of course I 'd get an answer like , " Visayans do n't make good movies . Did n't you see Panaghoy Sa Suba ? " Of course this is ludicrous as it is one example of a Visayan movie and probably the only example that anyone nowadays would be likely to see . An example of movies that are meditative , not just slow moving , are the Tagalog film Blackout or David Lynch 's The Straight Story . I hate to promote the Tagalog language as it is endlessly and unfairly promoted and shoved down the throats of non - Tagalog Filipinos but for the sake of calling a spade a spade I say that Blackout is a VERY good movie . These movies rely heavily on what Hitchcock called ' pure cinema ' . Images without words are used to convey the story . But I bend the definition a bit for the sake of these two movies in that these movies use images without words to convey the mood of the movie . and they do it very well . Panaghoy thinks that if they simply take sweeping shots of the landscape then they have established the mood . And what 's with so many Filipino movies featuring a dying mother or grandmother ? ? ?
pos	There is one detail , which is not very common for Jackie Chan movies , but which is present here . It has some very tough and serious atmosphere about it while the funny elements are present too . Jackie is menacing and psychotic here . He is not a hero who is attacked and only then fights back ( in a usual laid - back pattern ) , but he is the one who can go and start the tumult . His manner of hitting that evil guy in the glasses is amazing . Every time it goes " crack ! " . I also especially enjoy the scene when Jackie goes to the pub and thrashes the villains who had fronted on his girlfriend . It 's one of the best blitzkriegs put on screen . Besides , the whole scene is shot with the background of some action character painted on the wall ( it also looks like a poster of " rabochiy " from our Soviet era ) and some lines in Russian on the left ( I noticed that quite accidentally ) . That looks terrific ( and nostalgic for Russian people ) . I also like when the windows are being smashed in the movies . Here there 's a lot of this stuff . It 's quite amazing watching the characters falling / jumping / running / driving through all manner of panes . All three movies are great . I had been preparing myself to see the down - slide of the quality but I saw a perfect trilogy with sense and incredible stunts ( and not only Jackie Chan 's character appears in all three movies - that 's also excellent and keeps continuity up ) . I would like to describe each movie just in a few words : No.1 - great ( in all aspects - it is one gripping story from the very beginning to the very end ) and funny ( many scenes are ridiculous ) ; No.2 - raging ( Jackie is really * beep * off here ) and painful ( Jackie gets tortured ) ; No.3 - unbelievable ( the woman that fights alongside with Jackie is incredible ) and bombastic ( should I mention a lot of guns and explosions ? ) . As to the rest - much has been mentioned by the others . It 's a trilogy that can be watched over and over again ( at least by me ) . Its place is in top 10 among action / comedy jewels . Finally it 's been released in Russia on DVD ( the 2nd film has the best options - the Chinese / Russian soundtracks and English / Russian subtitles ) . Solid 10 out of 10 . Thank you for attention .
neg	I saw this movie years ago in a group tradition of Fast Forward Film Festivals , where we would set out to rent a bunch of B - movies and vote for who picked the worst . The night we watched this , it was voted the best , due to semblance of plot and fun costuming . This is certainly a silly , kitschy , movie , to be watched under the full understanding that you are watching low - budget fluff . Personally , however , I would n't recommend additional substances ... this movie will leave it 's own mark on you . It made enough of an impression on me that I 've actually been trying to get my hands on a copy for a few years . A good choice if you are setting out to watch bad movies . This one is fun , and I remember bouncy music ...
pos	In celebration of Earth Day Disney has released the film " Earth " . Stopping far short of any strident message of gloom and doom , we are treated to some excellent footage of animals in their habitats without feeling too bad about ourselves . The stars of the show are a herd of elephants , a family of polar bears and a whale and its calf . The narrative begins at the North Pole and proceeds south until we reach the tropics , all the while being introduced to denizens of the various climatic zones traversed . Global warming is mentioned in while we view the wanderings of polar bear ; note is made of the shrinking sea ice islands in more recent years . We never see the bears catch any seals , but the father 's desperate search for food leads him to a dangerous solution . The aerial shots of caribou migrating across the tundra is one of the most spectacular wildlife shots I ever saw ; it and another of migrating wildfowl are enough to reward the price of admission to see them on the big screen . One of the disappointments I felt was that otherwise terrific shots of great white sharks taking seals were filmed in slow motion . Never do you get the sense of one characteristic of wild animals ; their incredible speed . The idea of slowing down the film to convey great quickness I think began with ( or at least it 's the first I recall seeing ) the television show " Kung Fu " during the early Seventies . An interesting sidelight is that as the credits roll during the end some demonstrations of the cinematographic techniques employed are revealed . There are enough dramatic , humorous and instructive moments in this movie to make it a solid choice for nature buffs . Perhaps because of some selective editing ( sparing us , as it were , from the grisly end of a prey - predator moment ) and the fact that this footage had been released in 2007 and is available on DVD it is a solid film in its own right . And you can take your kids ! Three stars .
neg	Ironic that Dr. Seuss ' fable emphasizing the non - commercialization of Christmas should be one of the most hyped , marketed , and successful blockbusters of the holiday season . The general gist of Ron Howard 's adaptation is that the Grinch 's bane against Christmas stems from an early childhood incident and that the Who s themselves are caught up in the materialism of the season save for Cindy Lou Who ( played very well by Taylor Momsen ) . This movie makes an ardent , ambitious attempt to capture the wackiness and sentiment of Seuss ' story , but the end result is a movie that lurches and never quite packs the emotional punch of Chuck Jones ' animated version . Jim Carrey is noteworthy in his performance as the devilish Grinch , but whether it 's the dialogue , the pacing , or extraneous storylines heaped upon the initial plot , the transformation from bitter miser to gleeful benefactor just does not ignite convincingly . There are some wonderful visuals and the make - up work is amazing , yet beyond the technical triumphs there 's an element or two here that 's missing . Succinctness ? Soul ? Or maybe Jones did the initial adaptation all too well in his 25-minute cartoon that Howard falls short of in a movie that feels three hours long . Howard , Carey , and crew are all very capable and talented , but what would seem a winning combination is just weak and plodding in its final product . If you must see the feature - length version , rent it on video with Jones ' animated version and you can see how bigger and glitzier is not always better . I give this film three cans of Who - Hash out of five .
pos	Lost is one of a kind ... its so enchanting and full of suspense , thrill and emotions all at the same time . I have never seen any TV series like this before . It is full of jungle thrills and has a good screenplay . The actors have emoted life on an island in such a natural way that I feel lost in the island myself while watching it . It is an excellent piece of work narrated in a very intelligent form . The series is like a movie depicting the life of the survivors lost on a deserted island . I am tempted to watch one episode after the other and I highly recommend this series for all the TV show lovers . Watch it to see the magic of being lost in nowhere .
neg	Would n't it be great if Not Another Teen Movie actually put an end to all of these stupid , pointless , I 'm getting more sex than you are teen movies ? In a perfect world , yes . Yet this one is even worse . This one is not humiliating for the stars , it 's humiliating for the distributor . All of the jokes are basically college students exposing stuff that people probably have NO interest in seeing , yet it 's " funny . " Devon Sawa , who was actually good in Final Destination , is just plain dull in this movie . It makes you wonder if it 's being bad on purpose . Grade : F
pos	No message . No symbolism . No dark undercurrents . Just a wonderful melange of music , nostalgia and good fun put to - gether by people who obviously had a great time doing it . It 's a refreshing antidote to some of the pretentious garbage being ground out by the studios . Of course ANYTHING with the incomparable Judi Dench is worth watching . And Cleo Laine 's brilliant jazz singing is a bonus . This lady is in the same league as the late Ella . This goes on my movie shelf to be pulled out again anytime I feel the need for a warm experience and a hearty good natured chuckle . Just a wonderful film !
neg	This movie is about a very sexy Olympic track star who is hired to coach a high school boys ' basketball team . Similar to Goldie Hawn 's WILDCATS , it stars Cathy Lee Crosby in the title role , and she does as about as well as the script allows . I think Racquel Welch would have been a better choice , but considering the film 's apparent TV movie budget , they probably could n't afford her . Cathy Lee does look great in every shot , but we never get to see her completely nude . The story is pretty predictable , to say the least , offering no surprises . A young and lucky Michael Biehn has the male lead role . He is the star on the team and also the love interest for Cathy Lee . Keenan Wynn has a few amusing scenes as the rich old man who runs the athletic program and does n't think a woman should coach sports . This point is brought up throughout the film , and , needless to say , is dated . Ironically , Cathy Lee does n't put her team through any unorthodox practice sessions ; she does n't do anything a male coach would n't do . There is a funny subplot involving a tall and not - so - bright player who undergoes hypnosis in order to pass his classes and play like pro basketball player Sydney Wicks . It looks like everyone had a good time making this film , but the only real reason to see it is for Cathy Lee Crosby . She 's not that great an actress , but she has a dazzling smile , beautiful hair , and a very tan body .
pos	* I mark where there are spoilers ! Overall comments : If you can take a serious movie , go see this . Have an open mind and you will enjoy it . Do n't leave the theater because you get confused as to what is going on ! The movie fits together nicely in the second half . I will be taking my mom to see it again when the movie officially opens .   I was lucky to see this at a screening a couple of weeks ago , when Will was going around promoting the movie . He was great -- spent a lot of time with the fans . Thank you for the picture Will ! About Will 's performance : A lot of times when you see a movie with an actor really famous for some other movie / show , you always think of them in their current performance much like you think of them for their past performance . This is not the case with Will Smith in this movie . I did n't picture the Fresh Prince ( lol ) when I was watching this movie . He was completely and utterly convincing in this very , very serious role . He has grown immensely as an actor . I think he will at least get an Oscar nod for this performance . About his character : Ben is very conflicted and tormented . He 's sad ... guilt - ridden ... very determined , but very scared . Very true to himself . His character has a lot of depth ... and somehow , Will managed to bring that to life . About Emily ( Rosario ) : Rosario did a nice job portraying Emily , a woman very much behind on her taxes . Maybe she 's not the shining star Will is in this movie , but she was very convincing . I think her character just did not have as much to work with as Will 's did . About the plot ( no spoilers ) : I admit that I did NOT like the movie until the second half of it . I knew absolutely nothing about the movie going into it , and nothing made sense until the second part of it or so . But when things eventually fit together , wow . Surprisingly well written and well thought out . It 's an extremely intense movie that really sticks with you . It actually takes a lot out of you to watch . In the theater I was in , most people were crying towards the end -- even grown men . When you realize what Ben is doing , and why , it 's a very powerful moment ... * * * * * * * Minor SPOILERS * * * * * Which is why it 's really hard to talk about the plot without giving major things away . I feel like knowing too much about this movie really ruins it . There was a lot of symbolism in the movie that I enjoyed , though . I will mention some of it here ( without trying to give a lot away ) . -The fish that Ben was keeping in his hotel room . At first , it makes no sense whatsoever . There was a LOT of chatter in the movie theater when people realized the reality of the fish . -I hated Ben at the beginning of the movie . By the end of it , I loved him and hated him . That 's how convincing Will was . I thought Ben was being a huge jerk to Ezra , a blind man just trying to make his way in the world . Why he was treating Ezra like that also became abundantly clear later in the movie . Wait it out though . Everything in this movie : wait it out . -Ben is a fundamentally good person who made a big mistake that he wo n't forgive himself for . It 's still unclear to me if he was doing what he was doing because he was trying to rid himself of his own guilt , or if he genuinely wanted to help people . I think it 's a little bit of both ... I think he wanted to help people but also rid himself of his past . I love his character . You love him and hate him because you realize that what he is doing is nothing short of amazing . You hate him because of what he is doing to himself ( as a very good person ) , both physically and emotionally . Nice job Will .
neg	That this poor excuse for an amateur hour showcase was heralded at Sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most indie filmmakers these days . First of all , there is such a thing as the art of cinematography . Just picking up a 16 mm camera and pointing it at whomever has a line does not make for a real movie . I guess we have to consider ourselves lucky the director did n't pick up someone 's camcorder ... Second , indie films are supposed to be about real people . There 's nothing real in this film . None of the characters come across as being even remotely human . What they come across as being is figments of the imagination of a writer trying to impress his buddies by showing them how " cool and edgy " he is . Sorry , but this is not good writing , or good directing . What is left is a husk of a bad movie that somehow made its way to Sundance . Hard to believe this was one of the best films submitted ... In any case , it made me loose what was left of my respect for the Sundance brand .
pos	Certain DVD 's possess me until I just have to go out and buy it . This was one of those movies . Like many on here , I remember seeing it as a child and loved it . I never knew there were scenes and musical numbers that were cut , so I was intrigued to see what they might be . I will agree that the " Portabellow Road " sequence is now a tad long ( as is the soccer game ) but other than that , I found no qualms with the remaining scenes that were put back in their respectful place . Perhaps Disney should have had the original version ( which IS the restored version ) on one side with the restored version on the flip side , then people could choose what they wanted to view . All in all , it 's still an entertaining movie that still manages to recapture some of my childhood memories .
neg	The only redeeming quality of this film is the actual storyline ... Otherwise , this movie was terrible . The acting was ridiculously bad , and the set design was cheesy and very tacky . The story was decent , but it was very hard to watch due to all the horrid acting . I would n't recommend watching this one ... The only redeeming quality of this film was that the actors were somewhat attractive ... Especially Ryan Bauer , the man who plays the soap opera star . Some of the editing was well done , but there are continuity errors all over the place ... I'm just starting to get sick and tired of watching gay movies that are bad ... Can we get a good one soon ?
pos	  I saw The Glacier Fox in the theatre when I was nine years old - I bugged my parents to take me back three times . I began looking for it on video about five years ago , finally uncovering a copy on an online auction site , but I would love to see it either picked up by a new distributor and rereleased ( I understand the original video run was small ) , or have the rights purchased by The Family Channel , Disney , etc . and shown regularly . It is a fascinating film that draws you into the story of the life struggle of a family of foxes in northern Japan , narrated by a wise old tree . The excellent soundtrack compliments the film well . It would be a good seller today , better than many of the weak offerings to children 's movies today .
neg	For a good half hour or so , I remember myself thinking : " Hey , this could very well be Bill Rebane 's best achievement ever ! " . The opening sequences are atmospheric , there immediately are some scary moments to enjoy and our director even refers to his own notorious stinker " The Giant Spider Invasion " in a playful way . The concept is shamelessly stolen from William Castle 's " House on Haunted Hill " , with three old and extremely bored millionaires luring nine losers to an isolated mansion to win $ 1,000,000 in an elimination game . Naturally , the participants start vanishing quickly and one by one , and it takes the remaining greedy boneheads too much time before they realize either the old folks are sadists ... or there 's another murderer amongst them . The film begins & ends with an odd narrator telling a lot of senseless stuff that is n't relevant or even interesting to the plot , but there 's some nice T&A to admire in the first ten minutes and that dumb bimbo ( Shelly , I believe she 's called ) is really hilarious to observe . After the first half hour , naturally the inevitable happens and " The Cold " turns into a textbook Rebane - production with retarded plot twists , the dumbest dialogs ever and a total lack of excitement . There was n't any budget for bloody murder sequences but our multi - talented director ( ? ) tries to compensate this with endless footage of disco dancing girls and an amateur rock band . The film also has four or even five different climaxes and none of them are a slight bit satisfying . Maybe it was an inspiration for LOTR : Return of the King ? Avoid this film , you 'll live longer and happier .
pos	The great Vincent Price has done many fantastic Horror films , some of which range among the greatest genre gems of all - time . Price 's greatest achievements were doubtlessly his films in the 60s , with films such as Roger Corman 's brilliant Poe - cycle ( still the greatest Horror cycle of all - time ) , Michael Reeves ' " Witchfinder General " ( 1968 ) or Ubaldo Ragona 's " The Last Man on Earth " ( 1964 ) marking the ultimate highlights of this brilliant man 's career . The films that made the man famous and thereby made him the immortal Horror icon he is , however date back to the 50s , with " House of Wax " ( 1953 ) marking his rise to stardom . " The Mad Magician " of 1954 follows a plot that is very similar to that of its successful predecessor . This is not to say , however , that this film is n't an original , delightfully macabre and absolutely wonderful gem itself . As the lines above may suggest , Vincent Price is my favorite actor , and , while I personally would not allow myself to miss anything the man has been in , none of my fellow fans of the man may miss this little gem . Price stars as Don Galico ( aka . Galico the Great ) , an underrated master magician and inventor of magic devices , whose boss , a sleazy businessman , stole his wife ( Eva Gabor ) from him . When the boss takes away one of Galico 's ingenious inventions and gives it to his rival , The Great Rinaldi ( John Emery ) , Galico snaps , and a murderous spree of revenge begins ... Do n't we love Vincent Price when he 's out for revenge ? Some of his most famous and greatest films such as " The Abominable Dr. Phibes " ( 1971 ) or " Theater of Blood " ( 1973 ) were about absurd and delightfully macabre revenge murders , and this earlier film in his Horror career is another proof that no one takes revenge as Vincent Price does . This film provides a wonderfully eccentric leading role for Price , who , as always , delivers a brilliant performance , and guarantees 70 minutes of outrageously entertaining and macabre fun for every Horror fan . Another must - see for my fellow Price fans .
neg	This movie was rented by a friend . Her choice is normally good . I read the cover first and was expecting a good movie . Although it was a horror movie . Which i do n't prefer . But no horror came to mind while watching the movie . It was a dull , not very entertaining movie . The appearance of Denise Richards was again a pleasure for the eye . But that 's it . We ( the four of us ) we 're a little bit disappointed . But feel free to see this movie and judge it yourself .
pos	Lisa is a hotel manager or owner and she gets on a flight to Miami . She ends up sitting next to an assassin named Jackson who tells her that she has to switch a room of a family or her father dies . The reason she has to switch the room is because Jackson wants to blow it up . It 's a great suspense movie because Lisa tries several ways to escape this ploy that Jackson has set up . The whole storyline is great and I thought that they could have spent some more time on the plane . There could have more to the plane but other than that , the whole movie was pretty good . I especially liked the ending because it was heart - stopping . I did n't know what was going to happen and I was surprised by it . For me , this movie just took off .
neg	A mediocre Sci - Fi Channel original picture . A little squirmish , but not much . The nuclear powered submarine U.S.S. Jimmy Carter is on a mission deep below thick frigid ice near the North Pole when it is attacked by giant super charged electric eels . A member of the crew ( Simmone Jade Mackinnon)thinks she has devised a way to communicate with the monsters , but is not given much chance for vague reasons . Also among the crew are : David Keith , Mark Sheppard and Sean Whalen . This movie could have been somewhat better if the eels / monsters were not so cartoonish .
pos	What we 've got here is a Situation . A man is found to be in distress and people want to help him -- in contrasting ways . At the end they are forced to let it go . You ca n't fix people . And though in various aspects Reign Over Me is conventionally Hollywood , that message is n't . This story is not about Charlie Fineman ( Adam Sandler ) , a man who lost his wife and three daughters in a 9/11 plane who 's gone into a nearly psychotic state of PTSS since . It 's about what meeting Charlie does to Alan Johnson ( Don Cheadle ) , a dentist in New York who was his roommate in dental school and , knowing about his tragedy , spots him on the street and reconnects . Charlie is riding around on a little toy motorized scooter -- a pretty fanciful contraption for negotiating Manhattan traffic -- with big headphones on over a mass of unruly hair . The hair is Sandler 's chief prop to show he 's deranged . And the use of music as an escape must hit home to every iPod - wielding subway rider . Charlie is a disaster , but paradoxically Alan , stuck with a controlling wife ( Jada Pinkett Smith ) , soon begins to envy him . Charlie is living like an nutty adolescent boy with a huge trust fund ( insurance money from the tragedy ) , and starts dragging Alan off to " hang out , " " eat Chinese , " buy records , or watch a Mel Brooks marathon at a rep house . Charlie lives in a nice big apartment protected by a mean landlady , redoing the kitchen over and over , collecting old vinyl of Springsteen , the Who , etc . , and playing a video game called Shadow of the Collosus on a giant screen in a big empty living room . Charlie 's in - laws are deeply concerned about him , but also somehow resentful , as we learn later . Alan has a new patient who is propositioning him . Charlie 's desperation makes us see Alan 's . Trying to help Charlie partly permits Alan to escape from his own stifling realities but partly just makes him more acutely aware of them . Cheadle and Sandler make an odd couple , but that does n't matter , because it 's convincing that they might both need each other . Charlie is desperate for the companionship of a friend who never knew his family , because to escape his loss , he is pretending he never had one . And so what if as a roommate Charlie slept naked and sleep walked and had terrible musical taste ( no Motown ) ? Alan wants an escape from his tidy , emasculating life . He 's under the thumb not just of his wife but of his dental partners , who lord it over him though it 's he who set up the practice . They 're white , by the way , and he 's black . There 's also the lascivious patient from hell , who seriously disrupts things at the dental offices , but starts looking different when Charlie comes by and notices she 's a babe . His libido seems to be lurking ready to revive at any minute . He 's also drawn to the breasts of Liv Tyler , a psychotherapist in the same building as the dentists who starts trying to treat Charlie when he admits he might need help . Sandler 's mad scenes are a little too theatrical , as are a lot of the plot devices ( in fact this movie feels like a play at more than one point ) , but he has several monologues where he expresses his sorrow in ways that are deeply touching . Charlie 's not just delusional and sad , but dangerous and violent , and all these efforts to help him start to backfire . The movie is admirable in the way it conveys a sense that people ca n't be made right . This is an interesting movie -- sometimes a touching one -- and it 's the first time 9/11 has been dealt with in terms of survivor suffering . But there is an element of comedy that seems tasteless at times , many of the people are too broadly drawn , and the overly grand Hollywood interiors have dreadful décor ; only the Manhattan streets look real . There 's a courtroom scene that is preposterous , and Donald Sutherland is a judge who 's too good to be true . Alan 's family problem is resolved too easily with a phone call . And yet this is worth watching for the acting -- the control and subtlety of Cheadle , and Sandler in a serious role almost as good as the one he had in P.T. Anderson 's 2002 Punch - Drunk Love , though that 's clearly a better movie , in fact a much better one .
neg	Not an altogether bad start for the program -- but what a slap in the face to real law enforcement . The worst part of the series is that it attempts to bill itself as reality fare -- and is anything but . Men and women that dedicate their lives to the enforcement of laws deserve better than this . What is next , medical school in a minute ? Charo performing lipo ? Charles Grodin assisting on a hip replacement ? C'mon ... show a little respect . Even the citizens of Muncie are outing the program as staged . Police Academy = High School Gym ? Poor editing ( how many times can they use the car - to - car shot of the Taco Bell in the background ? ) , cheesy siren effects ( the same loop added ad nauseum to every ' call ' whether rolling code or not ) , and last , but not least -- more officer safety issues than you could shake a stick at . If I want to see manufactured police work and wise - ass fake cops , I would watch RENO 911 .
pos	Intelligent , stylish , and compelling thriller from the great Brian De Palma is a modern classic that firmly ranks among his best films ! When troubled housewife is brutally murdered by a bizarre stranger , the victim 's son joins with a prostitute to uncover the killer . Dressed to Kill left a strong impression upon the audiences of its day and for good reason . De Palma creates a wonderfully dramatic story that begins with an intriguing setup and builds into a harrowing mystery full of strong suspense . The finale and conclusion are especially ' nightmarish'.It 's a truly edge of your seat shocker . Even more impressive though is De Palma 's elegant direction that gives this film not only tight suspense but a unique and dark atmosphere of its own . Dressed to Kill is also a very erotic film , but mainly in a strangely beautiful way . Pino Donaggio also lends a lovely musical score to the film . The cast is another strong feature of this film . Michael Cain does a terrific turn as a psychiatrist . Angie Dickenson is wonderful as the ill - fated housewife . Nancy Allen 's performance as an involved street - walker is solid . A young Keith Gordon also proves to be a worthy supporter as the investigating son . Many criticize De Palma 's films for having Hitchcockian elements and this film was no exception . But any similarities between Hitchcocks works and De Palmas can only be seen as a good quality , as calling this film a ' rip - off ' would be degrading to a fine thriller . Dressed to Kill is a must see for all cinema fans . * * * * out of * * * *
neg	I suppose it 's nice and trendy to see wonderful things in the absolute emptiness of a film like this . With the sometimes pointless excesses of many Hollywood films , we can relax and enjoy a scene devoid of explosions , foul language , and corny one - liners . Minimalism has its place , and can be very effective when employed properly . However , this film is not one of those cases . Take the long scenes with no dialogue and dreary , sparse scenery . I 'm sure that they must hold some great meaning and insight , because the implied message in shrouded in bafflement . The acting is poor ... bland and pedestrian ... and features one of the worst crying scenes in history ( at the end of the film , if you can sit through it to the end ) . The scenery is drab , and the ridiculously long ending sequence of the girl walking through the barren park is as pleasurable as having a tooth pulled . I would call this anticlimatic , but as the film did n't build to any sort of climax whatsoever ... not even in the " erotic " scenes ... it would be untrue . I 'm sure that there was a script employed during the filming , but with the amount of dialogue , I think it might have been written on a cocktail napkin . Basically , this film offers nothing to interest or amaze ... no great story , no stunning insights , no visual drama , no excitement . Apart from two or three amusing moments , this film is a waste of two hours . A tragically boring and dreary film .
pos	Gandhi My Father is a well made movie . It nicely portrays the life of Gandhiji 's Eldest Son Harilal . His character , his differences with his father , his love for his family , his desire to stand on his own , his failure , his ego .. Akshaye Khanna completely justifies the role of Harilal . Just not him , everyone did well in the roles they played . Darshan Jariwala is the best on - screen Gandhiji I 've ever seen . But I will cut three points as there were few shortcomings . First , movie was fifteen - twenty minutes longer than it should have . Second , the movie needed more research into Harilal 's character . Somewhere , the character looked incomplete . Also , his relation with his brothers was not shown . There was no mention of any other child of Gandhiji in the whole movie . I believe the character like Harilal should be having at least some differences his brothers as well , considering the egoist nature of Harilal . Anyways , despite some shortcomings , I liked the movie . Recommended ...
neg	I 've never been a huge fan of Mormon films . Being a Mormon , I 've always felt that the humor was too exclusive to the LDS community and made us seem like a bunch of obsessive wackos . I was hoping this would be the breath of fresh air , the Halestorm movie I could finally discuss with my non - Mormon friends . Boy , was I wrong . I figured , since this had B - list talent like Clint Howard , Gary Coleman , Andrew Wilson , and Fred Willard ( one of my favorites ) , this would have to be at least a little funny . And besides , church basketball is ripe with potential for plenty of hilarious gags and such . But I must say , throughout the entire movie , it seemed as though no one knew what they were doing . Every joke fell flat , and every opportunity for a genuinely funny gag went ignored . The dialogue was bland , and the film had some of the worst character development I have ever seen . Every single character but Wilson 's was less than one - dimensional . It 's hard to believe that after nine re - writes the film was still as mind - numbingly stale as the train wreck I witnessed . I ca n't put into words the rage I felt sitting through this . My friends and I were extras in the final game scene , so we went to the premiere in Washington City , UT . Kurt Hale , the director , was there , and I must say , I avoided all contact with him after the show . He waited at the door , seemingly ready for feedback . I could n't bring myself to tell him that his film not only ripped away a good hour and a half of my life , but it left a nasty , painful scar that I will never forget . Here are a few specific problems I had : There was a minor love story subplot between the janitor and the chubby piano player , but these two characters came out of nowhere , and were impossible to care about , so my friends and I were left constantly wondering why we were supposed to care about these two lame , uninteresting characters . There were many subplots that popped up every now and then , each promising the audience the chance for laughs , but each one came and went in a puff of smoke , ending before you could even start caring . This was pretty much how the whole movie felt . This film was a major letdown , and I feel bad for everyone who 's expecting the first REAL funny Mormon movie . True , the jokes in this one are n't too exclusive to Mormons . Then again , it 's hard to tell what was a joke and what was a loud ringing sensation in my ears . Please , do NOT see this movie . Keep in your mind the fantasy that this movie is hilarious . Spare yourself the disappointment I went through
pos	First of all , in defense of JOAN FONTAINE , it must be said that Ginger Rogers would have been terribly miscast as Alyce , the young British lady who has the title role . Fontaine makes a fetching picture as the heroine here , but her acting inexperience shows badly and her dancing is better left unmentioned . Fortunately , she went on to better things . But here it 's FRED ASTAIRE , GEORGE BURNS and GRACIE ALLEN who get the top billing -- and they are excellent . Fans of Burns & Allen will be surprised at how easily they fit into Astaire 's dance routines . Especially interesting is the big fun house routine that won choreographer Hermes Pans an Oscar . They join Astaire in what has to be the film 's most inventive highlight . Unfortunately , not much can be said for the slow pacing of the story -- nor some of the stale situations which call for a lot of patience from the viewer . It must be said that some of the humor falls flat and the usual romantic misunderstandings that occur in any Fred Astaire film of this period are given conventional treatment . Only the musical interludes give the story the lift it needs . Some pleasant Gershwin tunes pop up once in awhile but not all of them get the treatment they deserve . The nice supporting cast includes Reginald Gardiner , at his best in a polished comic performance as a conniving servant , Constance Collier and Montagu Love ( as Joan 's father mistaken as a gardener by Astaire ) . It 's a lighthearted romp whenever Burns & Allen are around to remind us how funny they were in their radio and television days . Both of them are surprisingly adept in keeping up with Astaire 's footwork . Director George Stevens makes sure that Joan Fontaine 's hillside dance number with Fred is filmed at a discreet distance but clever camera - work can not disguise the fact that she is out of her element as Astaire 's dance partner , something she seems painfully aware of .
neg	First let me say that I am not a Dukes fan , but after this movie the series looked like Law and Order . The worst thing was the casting of Roscoe and Boss Hogg . Burt Reynolds is not Boss Hogg , and even worse was M.C. Gainey as Roscoe , If they ever watched the show Roscoe was not a hard ass cop . He was more a Barney Fife than the role he played in this movie . The movie is loaded with the usual errors , cars getting torn up , and continues like nothing happened . The worst example of this is when the the General gets together with Billy Prickett , and the General is ran into a dirt hill obviously slowing to a near stop , but goes on to win the race .
pos	This is one of those westerns that , well , stands practically alone in the unrelieved quality of its dialog . Very few can hold up to it over the long haul . That said , the rest is pretty bad . Nevertheless I am giving it an eight because there is no other western with such consistently good dialog with maybe the exception of The Wild Bunch , Junior Bonner , and perhaps a few more .   It is riddled with weaknesses , John Drew Barrimore the most glaring . However it does have one truly memorable scene . Nothing like it . Its right after Kid Wichita kills the sheriff , and goes to Jack Elams place trying to goad him into a fight . Wonderful stuff . Right up with the best in any western .
neg	Just a regular Jason lee movie , There were some parts of the movie that were funny . The undertone of the move is to live life on the edge I guess . These are the types of movies that I think 14 year old girls watch at slumber parties . It was an all right movie . It is kind of one of those movies you have on in the back ground and look up every now and then to when something catches attention . I think That Julia stiles and Selma Blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot . Its just kind of a boy meets girl movie . This is that perfect movie they would show on comedy Central . I am glad that I did n't see this movie in the theater , I would have been angry . But I guess that 's why I did n't see it in the theater .
pos	When watching A Bug 's Life for the first time in a long while , I could n't help but see the comparisons with last year 's Happy Feet . As far as the main storyline goes , they are very similar , an outcast doing what he can to fit in while also attempting to be special . It just goes to show you how much better that film could have been without its liberal diatribe conclusion . A lot of people disagree with me when I say that I really like Pixar 's sophomore effort . Sure it does n't manage to capture the splendor of Toy Story , nor is the animation out of this world . However , the story is top - notch and the characters are wonderful to spend time with . With plenty of laughs and a moral center to boot , I could watch this one just as much as the studio 's other classics . There is a lot about finding strength from within to conquer all odds here . Between our lead Flick needing to keep his self - esteem up to save his colony , the colony needing to open their eyes onto a new way of living for the future , and the circus bugs finding that they are more than just untalented sideshow freaks , everyone evolves into a better bug by the end of the story . Even the villain Hopper is fully fleshed and menacing for the right reasons . He is not doing it to be mean , but instead understands the fact that the ants outnumber him 100 to 1 . He needs them to fear him in order to not have to worry about them finding out the truth . It is very much a circle of life , but not one that ca n't evolve with the ages . When thinking about the animation , it is actually quite good . Compared to Antz , the rival film of the time , this is much more realistic and less cartoony . The water is rendered nicely , as is the foliage . You do n't have to look much further than the ants ' eyes to see how much detail went into the production . The reflections and moistness , despite the smooth exterior , shows the realism . All the bugs are finely crafted too . The flies in the city and the crazy mix of creatures recruited to save the ants are never skimped on , whether for a small role or a more expanded one . It is also in the city that we see the workmanship on the environments . While Ant Island is nice , it is just the outdoors . Bug City contains plenty of garbage doubling as buildings and clubs . It is a great showing of humor and inventiveness to see what the animators used for everything . From the ice cube trays as circus stands , the animal crackers box as circus wagoncomplete with full nutrition guide on the sideand crazy compilation of boxes to create a Times Square of billboards and facades , everything is done right . As far as much of the humor , you have to credit the acting talent for wonderful delivery and inspired role choices . No one could do a male ladybug better than Dennis Leary with his acerbic wit . I dare you to think of someone better . Our leads are great too with Dave Foley as Flick and Julia Louis - Dreyfus as Princess Atta , as well as the always - fantastic Kevin Spacey as Hopper . Spacey not only steals many scenes from the movie , but also takes center stage in the bloopers during the credits . Yes , A Bug 's Life was the originator of animated outtakes from Pixar , a tradition that has continued on . With many tongue - in - cheek bug jokes laced throughout , you also have to give props to the huge supporting cast . Full of " those guy actors , " it is people like Richard Kind , Brad Garrett , and the late Joe Ranft as Heimlich the worm who bring the biggest laughs . Overall , it may be the simplest story brought to screen by Pixar , one that has been told in one form or the other numerous times over the years , but it is inspired enough and fresh enough to deliver an enjoyable experience . There are joyous moments , sad times , and even action packed scenes of suspense with birds coming in to join the fun . Complete with a couple of my favorite Pixar characters , Tuck and Roll , there is n't too much bad that I can think of saying about it .
neg	Okay like most Steven Seagal fans I know I not going expect a masterpiece every time he makes a film but I do expect the film to at least have some sorter budget . The main problem with the copy I watched was the terrible over dubbing I know that in some films this has to be done and I accept that but when they overdub with a totally different actors voice and keep doing this thru out the film it does take the magic of overdubbing away . Also the sets seem to be built with no care as in one scene the sliding glass top in a top secret lab has a massive crack going thru it . I was truly disappointed with this film and only hope Stevens next project will be more finished off before sending the film out for buying / renting . The story of this film had me wondering if I was watching a sci - fi film or not some parts seemed alien like but they never fully explained what was going on I found it very confusing .
pos	Izzard was both hysterical and insightful in his humor . He definitely represents his own little niche in the comedic world . It 's a pity more Americans wo n't see this stand - up routine due to its PAL - only availability .
neg	The plot is straightforward an old man living off a main road in woodland one day witnesses a man murdering a child in the woods . Soft For Digging follows the old man 's attempts to try and convince the police that what he saw was not a figment of his imagination . However , there is a problem each time the old man guides the police to where the murder happen no corpse can be found . Soft For Digging has a diminutive dialogue which reflects the majority of the scenes of the film , an old man living by himself in a house . During the film I found that I was scared twice namely when the murdered child abruptly appears before the old man . The rest of the film I have to admit did not engage me ; I found the tempo of the film a little too slow . The limited dialogue was not a problem . However , the development of the story and its conclusions , after watching the film , took too long . I feel more could have been made of the relationship , ghostly encounters , with the child and the old man . Alone in the woods at night unsure of your own mind can lead to some eerie situations , children are always scary as ghosts , see Dark Water .
pos	I have to say , when " Pushing Daisies " came out I was immediately won out by the fairy - tale like setting of such grimness . The narrator made a cake out of the whole ordeal by making death seem as routine as , well , Ned ( Lee Pace ) baking pies . And that bringing them back to life was just as routine . The trio of Ned , Emerson Cod ( Chi McBride ) and Charlotte " Chuck " Charles ( Anna Friel ) , plus sometimes - sidekick Olive Snook ( Kristin Chenoweth , who made the musical Wicked such a delight ) made for some fantastic dialogue and silliness . It definitely deserves the title of a ( romantic ) comedy / drama . Ned and Chuck made for a shy and not - quite - ready - for - love couple who are still exploring their feelings even though they can not touch - an obstacle that seems to be truly no obstacle with aids such as gloves , cellophane , and quirky schedules around the apartment . But despite the awkwardness presented as they work their feelings around a strange secret which only a few know , they still manage to show their on screen chemistry in touching scenes like when Ned gives Chuck the beehives . The presence of Olive , though , makes for some break - out - in - song moments in the pie shop and unforeseen complications for the couple . Second season sharply declined , putting a damper on a show that had real potential . On some of the episodes , the plot line was rushed and awkward , making you ask " what just happened ? " in both the overall dead - person - of - the - week plot and in the overriding plot line . The addition of Chuck 's father plus two half - brothers for Ned did n't help , and at least one of the plot lines felt almost recycled ( did n't the episode " Comfort Food " feel like the episode " Bitter Sweets " in the fact that the dead - person - of - the - week died in food ? ) . A few touching moments ( the beehives ) happened to help advance the relationship between Chuck and Ned , but every time they got close , the writers decided to throw in another monkey wrench rather than let the relation develop ( Oliver comes back from the monastery , Chuck 's dead father comes back to life and does n't go back , you get the picture ) . Shame it did n't work out , but the concept was good and seemed surreal in a good way , just enough Pleasantvillesque color / happy - smiley going on and implausible scenarios to remind you that it 's not " Dead Like Me . " Then again , it 's in " Pushing Daisies time , " according to Creator Bryan Fuller , so it makes it plausible again . It should have lasted longer , but it 's merely wistful thinking at this point . Kudos to whatever new show attempts to replace this short - lived gem .
neg	I fail to see the appeal of this series ( which is supposed to be sci - fi ) . It 's really just " let 's see what soap operatically happens this week " and oh , the Cylons are involved through flashbacks . The Cylon " babe " that keeps nailing the other guy is pretty lame , it 's pretty obvious that T&A was added to the show . Every time she pops up I 'm bewildered as to WTF is supposed to be going on . And do n't even try to bullsh*t me about " story arcs " . It 's a soap opera with some CGI thrown - in . This is not science fiction aside from the original premise . This series is not everything it 's worked - up to be . If you like trendy , edgy , dodgy , jumpy , vague editor - on - crack camera work , this show might be for you . Since nerds seem to be raving about this show , it 's a clear indication that vocal nerds ' opinions have been changed from Picard 's TNG .
pos	GREAT movie and the family will love it ! ! If kids are bored one day just pop the tape in and you 'll be so glad you did ! ! ! ~~~Rube i luv raven - s !
neg	Well , one has to give the director credit for how gutsy he was . Gutsy would be the right term . Not only did he use a total cast of five people ( no extras at ALL ) , but he also decided to use sub - par special effects with a confusing and boring plot , he also , and I AM NOT kidding , put a warning at the beginning of the movie that you might DIE OF FRIGHT ! ! ! However , they do promise a FREEEEEE COOOOFFFFFFFIIIIINNNNN . To have a creepy limping gardener is always a good move . Yaaa - unique - aaawwwwnnn .... If you watch Mystery Science Theater 3000 , you might 've seen this . They like to showcase horrible movies , just to let you know . A good gift for someone you hate .
pos	This has to be one of the best movies to come out of HK in a long time , i was eagerly waiting to get my hands on this movie just looking at the title . Loads of fantastic actors in this show and i was particularly impressed with Sam Lee 's impossibly believable insane behavior and Edison 's portrayal of a killer machine , which totally reversed his normal idol image . i would definitely recommend to those looking for a stylish and action packed movie . However , i must warn you , this is also an equally depressing movie , as every character in the movie is in some kind of dead end and trouble of their own , and struggling to breathe . Makes you think about what is life about really .
neg	RUN ... do not walk away from this movie ! ! ! ! ! Aimed at the very young kids , this movie will bore you to tears . If the Gamera trilogy of the 90 's raised the bar , this film just lowered it . It 's slow paced and the monster fighting is good , but seldom seen . This movie had me dry heaving in the cat box . Just a very poor offering after a phenomenal 90 's series . SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Here are the top 10 reasons Gamera fans of the 90 's series will HATE this film . 10 . This movie is a drama that follows a kid trying to cope with the death of his mother and fears losing baby Gamera to a fight after knowing his father saw the adult Gamera die . 9 . You see the adult Gamera for maybe a minute at the beginning of the film . He gets his butt kicked by a few Gyaos and self destructs ? ? ? He looks old and lethargic . Plus he looks nothing like any gamera you 've ever seen . His suit looked cheap and rushed . 8 . The young Gamera you see through the rest of the film looks like a Pokemon . Big - eyed and cute ... it will remind you of the baby Godzilla from Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla 2 . Gamera is now too cute . 7 . This movie has the pace of watching a NASCAR race during a 3 hour rain delay . I watched this movie with 2 other Gamera fans and nobody was happy with how slowly this film moved along . I 've seen an SUV full of fat people going up a mountain road move faster . 6 . Like Godzilla : Final Wars , this movie had very little kaiju time on screen . Final Wars had much more , actually , and better fights although short . 5 . Kids take the title role . The friend of all children theme and poor writing killed the original Gamera series in the 1970 's and history repeats itself in the 2000 's . The most successful Gamera films abandoned the Sesame Street feel and went to a darker place . Why go back to a failed formula ? This was to be a new trilogy and poor ticket sales killed any hope for this story to continue ( thank god ) . 4 . Gamera lost his iconic roar . He now sounds like an Elephant with strep throat . 3 . This movie may produce a new Olympic event ..... Imagine a relay race that involves sending very young children into harm 's way . You have to see the ending to understand this point . Where were the parents ? Oh yea .. right there sending their kids into a kaiju battle zone . 2 . The special effects were good , but sub - par for a Gamera movie . Legion and Iris had better effects . The best effect was showing the apple sized baby Gamera fly . Not too impressive . 1 . This movie is just not what adult kaiju fans come to expect . The director was involved in Power Rangers and it shows . It comes off like a cross between ET , Always : Sunset on Third Street and TMNT . Kudos if you know all 3 references . Rental at best or watch once if you buy it to complete the DVD series .
pos	From the mind of Robert Bloch , of " Psycho " fame , come four tales of twisty terror in this Amicus anthology film , which , while not quite as much fun , or scary , as I would have liked , still provides for some decent genre entertainment . It 's linked by the wrap - around story of a highly skeptical Scotland Yard detective ( John Bennett ) who is investigating the disappearance of a prominent actor ; he 's advised that this case is linked to a few others by the house in which they all took place , and our film is off and running . " Method for Murder " has author Charles Hillyer ( always delightful Denholm Elliott ) haunted by his latest fictional creation , who has seemingly come to life . This sequence has some good surreal and fairly suspenseful moments , and is capped by a reasonably amusing revelation and denouement . " Waxworks " stars horror icon Peter Cushing as retired stockbroker Philip Grayson , who , along with old friend Neville Rogers ( Joss Ackland ) becomes obsessed with the image of a beautiful woman found in a macabre wax museum . Most effective in this episode is the dream sequence , although it 's great as always to watch Cushing . The final images presented to us in this story are pretty shocking . " Sweets to the Sweet " features another well - loved horror star , Christopher Lee , as John Reid , who does n't treat adorable moppet child Jane ( Chloe Franks ) with too much kindness , and it 's up to new companion / tutor Ann Norton ( Nyree Dawn Porter ) to find out why . The mystery of this particular episode is handled excellently ; the film - makers wisely do n't tip their hand so it comes as more of a genuine shock as we get the full truth of this unhappy family . The " dying " moments are particularly horrific . " The Cloak " has the most outright comedy of the four ; Jon Pertwee , one of many actors to have played the role of Dr. Who over the years , is a lot of fun as a vain , temperamental horror movie star ( in fact , he 's the highlight of this story ) who , infuriated with the lack of quality in his latest low - budget film , goes out and buys his own cloak . Said cloak has strange powers , which I dare not reveal here . Sexy Ingrid Pitt is a welcome presence as Pertwees ' companion ; one wonderful example of the humor here is a knowing jab taken at none other than Christopher Lee ! The wrap - up story then concludes in a predictable but still effective way as Detective Inspector Holloway learns that he should have taken all of the warnings given him more seriously . Underscored by Michael Dress 's unusual , striking , and eerie score , " The House That Dripped Blood " is an entertaining mix of stories ; while I do n't enjoy it quite as much as , say , " Tales from the Crypt " , it 's still good fun . Capably directed by Peter Duffell , it moves slowly but surely towards each of its chilling conclusions , and is certainly a good film of its type . 7/10
neg	Revolt of the Zombies has no redeeming features . I 'm tired of people arguing that it 's not that bad , and that the effects must have packed more of a punch in 1936 . I suspect this is n't true : it 's not like IQ 's have risen sharply in the last 7 decades . The average viewer in 1936 was probably just as bored by this rubbish as the average viewer today . Why ? Just try watching the first scenes , and count the pauses between things happening , the awful choice of when to cut to close - up , the slapdash editing that seems to include an extra two seconds on every shot to pad out the running time . Pay attention to the utterly redundant dialogue : " I 'm going to make some tea / go outside / read my book now . " " Are you ? " " Yes , I am . " That sort of exchange happens several times . Normally I would love that , being a HUGE fan of bad movies , but watch the listless actors mumbling their trite and tedious lines , and all desire to laugh at the movie slowly fades away . This sort of disinterested , pot - boiling time - waster is far worse than energetic , imaginative mind - blowers like Plan Nine From Outer Space or Santa Claus Conquers The Martians . Those who claim that this is " better " than those more interesting movies have a backwards idea of entertainment . This movie is not bad in the sense that your jaw hangs open in astonishment : it 's bad in the sense that your eyes slowly close in boredom . Which is far worse .
pos	The Japanese cyber - punk films have never really done a whole lot for me , but of the handful that I 've seen , most have been at least visually interesting and at least mostly entertaining . MEATBALL MACHINE is no exception . The storyline is about a species of parasites that take over human hosts , takes control of their bodies , turns them into " necroborgs " , and causes them to fight each other with the sole purpose of eating each other - apparently as a " game " for the enjoyment of said parasites . The film mainly revolves around a shy guy and gal who fall for each other , but whose love - affair is cut short by both being infected with the parasites , and are forced to fight each other . It becomes a test of human - will vs. the parasite 's control over their physical bodies ... MEATBALL MACHINE will invariably be compared to TETSUO ( as most cyber - punk films are ) , and for good reason . There are definitely some thematic parallels , though the films are definitely different . There 's plenty of fun , splattery moments in MEATBALL MACHINE , and the creature / borg FX are definitely the high - point - a mixture of TETSUO - meets - GWAR that are both elaborate and inventive . Depending on your taste for these types of films , MEATBALL MACHINE may or may not be your thing . If you enjoy hyper - kinetic cyber - punk films with a healthy dose of splatter - this one 's for you ... 7/10
neg	Watching this movie made me think constantly ; why are they making such a problem out of some broken brakes ? There are a million options to slow down the car ! In the movie Speed the writers a least thought of a good reason why the car was n't able to stop ... There are n't many good things to say about this film ; all the usual narrative cliche 's make their appearance , the actors are very bad , the story is as leak as a sieve etc . That makes this movie a waste of time and money .
pos	This movie was like any Jimmy Stewart film , witty , charming and very enjoyable . Kim Novak 's performance as Gillian , the beautiful witch who longs to be human , is splendid , her subtle facial expressions , her every move and gesture all create Gillian 's unique and somewhat haunting character , she left us hanging on her every word . I should not fail to mention Ernie Kovacs ' and Elsa Lanchester 's highly commendable performances as the scotch loving writer obsessed with the world of magic(Kovacs ) and the latter as the lovable aunt who ca n't seem to stop using magic even when forbidden to . The romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak are beautifully done and the chemistry between them is great , but then again when is the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and any leading lady bad !
neg	Phew -- I do n't what to say . This is a film that could be really good a with a bunch of stoned viewers . Some of the acting reminded me of John Waters ' early offerings . Perhaps I should take that back -- I do n't want to insult Waters ' ability as a director / storyteller . I particularly loved the lawyer taking about the " full faith and credibility " clause . It 's " full faith and credit , " by the way ! This also reminds me of " The Conrad Boys , " where the main actor is also the writer , director , film editor , etc . Those sort of multi - involved undertakings such as that are probably best left to very seasoned film professionals who would have the technical ability ( albeit a stunt , some might say ) to pull something off like that .
pos	Loved the movie . I even liked most of the actors in it . But , for me Ms. Davis ' very poor attempt at an accent , and her stiff acting really makes an otherwise compelling movie very hard to watch . Seriously if any other modern actor played the same role with the same style as Ms. Davis they would be laughed off the screen . I really think she ' phoned this one in ' . Now if it had Myrna Loy or Ingrid Bergman playing the part of the wife I would have enjoyed it much more . I guess I just do n't ' get ' Bette Davis . I 've always thought of her as an actor that ' plays herself ' no matter what role she 's in . The possible exception is Now Voyager . I 'm sure many of the other reviewers will explain in careful ( and I hope civil ) detail how I am totally wrong on this . But , I 'll continue to watch the movies she 's in because I like the stories / writing / supporting casts , but , I 'll always be thinking , of different actresses that could have done a better job .
neg	" Visitor Q " is a failed attempt at black comedy which focuses on what might be the world 's most dysfunctional family including physical abuse from beatings to murder to incest to sodomy to necrophilia to a lactating mom who nurses her husband and adult daughter , etc . The film is so outrageous it garnered some critical praise and established a small cult following . However , with home video quality and a slapdash production , " Visitor Q " just does n't hold up even as a curiosity . Genitals are blurred out and sanitary appliances clearly visible , make - up is awful , and everything else is amateurish at best . A waste of time . ( C- )
pos	A single mother(Diane Keaton ) finds herself working several minimum - wage jobs . When she gets fired , she finds that she is unable to support her sons(Michael Seater and Colin Roberts ) , the latter of whom has asthma . Then she goes to her friend and starts selling drugs . Soon enough , she gets addicted to the drugs that she is selling . Her life comes crashing down , especially when her kids , namely her oldest son , find out the truth and threaten to leave her . Then , she struggles to redeem herself with the help of her kids but can she protect her family from the drug lords who she worked for ?   Wow ! This lifetime movie has some of the best acting I have ever seen ! Diane Keaton overacts a lot , and her character comes off as crazy but she was extremely convincing . She is much better suited to drama than to comedy . However , the best performance in the movie comes from Michael Seater , who plays her oldest son . He is perfect as the responsible son who is still young but trying to be the adult in the family . His acting was especially great in the scenes where he confronts his mom about the drugs . Colin Roberts , who plays the younger son , also does a great job . A movie well worth watching , especially because of the acting from Michael Seater and Diane Keaton !
neg	This movie is AWESOME . I watched it the other day with my cousin Jay - Jay . He said it was alright , but i think it RULEZZZ ! I mean , it 's so cool . Ted V. Mikels is so brave and smart . He made a movie totally unlike those terrible Hollywood films , like the Matrix and STop or my Mom will Shoot . It could have been better , though . I like ninjas and pirates . I also like that big talon that the funny man wears . I think he 's the coolest guy since that Domino Pizza claymation guy . Not only does this movie look really cool , like those out - of - focus movies my dad made of my birthday when I turned 6 . BUt it tells a complex tale with dozens of characters that seem to be totally unrelated , but they all meet up in the end . It 's genius how this web is woven to make everything meet up . I wish Ted V. Mikels would make a sequel . But it needs more aliens . And a pirate .
pos	The movie celebrates life . The world is setting itself for the innocent and the pure souls and everything has " Happy End " , just like in the closing scene of the movie . The movie has wonderful soundtrack , mixture of Serbian neofolk , Gypsy music and jazz . This movie is very refreshing piece of visual poetics . The watching experience is like you 've been sucked in another colorful , romantic and sometimes rough world . Like Mr. Kusturica movie should be .
neg	Encompassing virtual reality , the potential of computers , communication with the past , the ongoing struggle to express your identity in a constraining society , and the fascinating Ada Byron Lovelace portrayed by the fascinating Tilda Swinton , this film should have been great . But it is lousy , terrible if you consider the potential ! The acting - aside from Tilda Swinton and Karen Black - veers from tolerable to atrocious . The plot construction is awkward to say the least - the modern day programmer is a dull one - note character , but half the movie is spent setting up her character , and then when Ada finally appears , it is to narrate the events of her life , not to present an engaging story ( Swinton almost pulls this off , though ) . You never fully get to know her as a real person , just an icon from a grad student 's history paper . The digital effects , such as a digital dog and bird , are lousy and distracting , considering it was 1997 and not 1985 . And , finally , the script is just bad . Bad , often pretentious dialog - especially the fights between the programmer and her boyfriend , which made me squirm - cold and distant characters , and zero attempt to create a sense of wonder . The programmer successfully contacts a person in the past ! Astonishing ! But it hardly seems to surprise anyone , and her boyfriend says , " Well , be careful . " ( Although we 're given no clue then or later why it might be dangerous , and it never seems to actually be dangerous . ) Also , despite being about computers and Ada Lovelace and her love of mathematics , it is clear no one involved with the script had any knowledge of mathematics OR computers - any references to these subjects come across as complete mumbo jumbo that defies any suspension of disbelief . One scene , towards the end of the movie , is quite good , a monolog by Tilda Swinton expressing her sadness at the fragility of life but her joy in that life . Poignant , passionate , and insightful , it seems to be dropped in from another movie . So I am disappointed in this movie , because it is a missed opportunity for a fascinating little cult film . If you find the subject matter interesting , you might want to rent it , but be forewarned . See Orlando for another , much much better examination of gender roles in history with a great Tilda Swinton performance . * * * spoiler / question : * * At the end of the movie , Ada asks that her memories not be preserved ( in what I thought was the best scene in the movie ) . But then the modern day programmer seems to do it anyway , transferring the memories into her little girl ( hence the title of the movie ) . Am I correct , that the programmer violated Ada 's wishes without even struggling over it ? Or is this another confusing plot point that I 'm misinterpreting ?
pos	Kurt Russell 's chameleon - like performance , coupled with John Carpenter 's flawless filmmaking , makes this one , without a doubt , one of the finest boob - tube bios ever aired . It holds up , too : the emotional foundation is strong enough that it 'll never age ; Carpenter has preserved for posterity the power and ultimate poignancy of the life of the one and only King of Rock and Roll . ( I 'd been a borderline Elvis fan most of my life , but it was n't until I saw this mind - blowingly moving movie that I looked BEYOND the image at the man himself . It was quite a revelation . ) ELVIS remains one of the top ten made - for - tv movies of all time .
neg	I watched this movie as a preview of a Matthew Barney art exhibit . It certainly prepared me . I almost skipped the exhibit and , in retrospect , probably should have . Aside from the score being great ( Bjork ) and the photography rich and colorful , the content was mostly tedious and predictable . Gee , I really needed to see someone wearing pearls to figure out what the pearl - divers were up to . The film was mostly a silly mixture of Japanese cultural references and industrial shots of modern whaling technology being used in a mock - hunt / harvest . The film " peaks " with enough gratuitous shock - art to turn your stomach . What was the point of the movie ? While others might argue that it is an anti - whaling piece , one could equally argue that it somehow also justifies whaling . Personally I think it was Barney 's attempt at " flashing " the audience with his anal , fecal , self - mutilation , and cannibalistic fetishes . Bottom line : unless you really get off on Barney 's sense of art , do n't bother seeing this movie . The message is obscure , the pace slow , and the cultural references pretentious . If you 're after shock - art , you 'll do better at one of the many " Undead " movies or hunting down an old copy of Hustler and taking in a fecal - cartoon .
pos	Simply but imaginatively filmed studio - set performance short , a perfect match of music and images that defines the very coolness of cool and the hipness of hip . The precise visual and musical arrangements give the lie to its claim to be a record of a jam session : what it is , is a pop video - every bit as stylised and knowing as that implies , and all the better for it . Among the very best music films ever made , and almost certainly the most cinematic . These cats are solid gone , daddy - o ...
neg	Vampire cyborgs rule the world and use the blood of humans as fuel , however there is going to be a shift of power thanks to a renegade android ( Kris Kristofferson ) and a warrior woman ( Kathly Long ) as they face off against Lance Henriksen and Gary Daniels ( Who play the cyborgs in this ridiculous movie ) Of all the questions left unanswered by this dreadful movie , the most poignant is Who 's idea was it to cast country singer Kris Kristofferson as a cyborg warrior who is able to give as good as he gets . No , do n't get me wrong I could see Kristofferson as a vigilante or something but not as a cyborg . Strangely one suspects that this was written for Dolph Lundgren , however Lundgren must have had the wisdom to not do it . However despite the disastrous casting , Kristofferson is easily the most enjoyable thing about the movie . He gives a performance far more human then the inexpressive Kathy Long . ( And Kristofferson is playing a robot ) despite the miscasting , Kristofferson provides the few moments of interest . Lance Henriksen is slumming and Gary Daniels is wasted but basically Knights is baffling failure . You stand back in horror wondering who the hell thought that this was even a good idea on paper . ( This is a movie where a dismembered Kristofferson is fighting robots in a backpack ) Worst of all it ends in a what if sequel , thankfully this has yet to materialize although I still have nightmares at the proposition of the likelihood of such an event . * out of 4-(Bad )
pos	This stylistically sophisticated visual game presents a story within a story ' . The protagonist is scriptwriter Bart Klever who fights persistently with his new text  which is , at the same time , the screenplay of the film we 're watching . In the movie Bart plays a scriptwriter writing the script of the film   Bart 's struggle with the text becomes a narrative theme , as does the environment of the flat where he works and takes care of his little girl . The intimate environment offers ample opportunity for games of illusion involving space , light , colours and a couple of cats . The outwardly simple world of the room is further complicated by the unstable dimensions of a text continually influenced by the filmmaker 's interventions , which appears on a computer monitor and serves as a counterpoint to the similarity mutable environment . The constantly changing viewing angle complicates answers to questions which arise : What is truth ' and what illusion ' ? Which of the observed worlds is primary and superior to the rest ? Can anything serve as a basic orientation point in the narrative space ?
neg	I read a couple of good reviews on this board for " Mr. Scarface " , but for anyone uninitiated in the genre of Italian gangster films like myself , the picture will probably make very little sense . Indeed , after the initial setup involving the ten million lira scam , the picture devolved into a fairly routine revenge flick with a minor twist in the identity of Rick 's ( Al Cliver ) character . The whole gang war plot got muddied up for me with the inclusion of Vinchenzo Napoli ( Vittorio Caprioli ) , but as most other viewers commented , he 's about the only one who gave this picture any life with his often ineffective attempts at violence . I found it somewhat unbelievable that Manzari 's goons who chased Tony through the streets did n't actually stroke out before Tony even laid a hand on them . For all of his buildup as the title character , Jack Palance was wasted rather unceremoniously in an anticlimactic near finale , making the U.S. working title , " Mr. Scarface " , rather moot . I 've seen enough spaghetti Westerns to know that they do n't all work ; I guess in this case , my first look at a spaghetti gangster flick did n't quite make it either .
pos	a timeless classic , wonderfully acted with perfect location settings , conjuring a marvelous atmospheric movie . a simple story mingled with humor and suspense . i wish that a video was available in Britain . i have seen this film on many occasions and it remains one of my favorites along with Oh Mr Porter .
neg	Oliver Hardy awakens with a hangover and soon learns that his uncle is coming to see Ollie 's new wife and baby . The problem is , they do n't exist -- Ollie apparently made them up ! So , it 's up to him and his pal to locate a lady with a baby who will agree to pose as his family . This is n't a particularly unique story idea , as I 've seen at least a couple other silent shorts with this exact plot . The best of these was Bobby Vernon 's DON'T KID ME . It is much better than ONE TOO MANY -- probably much of this was due to it being made a decade later -- when comedy became a bit more sophisticated and relied less on pointless slapstick . Now I am not against physical comedy , but in some slapstick films , people starting shooting guns wildly , kick and strangle each other , etc . with little provocation . Sadly , at the end of ONE TOO MANY , that 's exactly what they do . None of it makes sense and it was as if they 'd just run out of story ideas . Overall , not exactly a milestone in entertainment . There 's just not enough payoff to merit watching it unless you are an obsessive silent fan like myself .
pos	The War Between the States was perhaps the darkest hour in the history of America ; a war that pitted brother against brother and family against family and left scars that even today have not yet healed , and in all probability never will . And , as in any story about any war , beyond any historical significance it is the personal discord behind the greater conflict that creates the emotional impetus that makes it involving . It is the human element that renders the context necessary to give it perspective , which is what director Ang Lee provides in ` Ride With the Devil , ' a Civil War drama in which he focuses on the personal travails within the broader depiction of the War itself , and along the way manages to include an examination of one of the bloodiest chapters of the War , the infamous raid on Lawrence , Kansas , by Quantrill and his raiders , which he succeeds in presenting quite objectively from the Confederate point - of - view . In 1863 , the Union influence predominates in the State of Kansas , and even across the border in neighboring Missouri , those with Confederate loyalties are finding it increasingly difficult to hold out against the encroaching Northerners , especially without the aid of what could be considered any ` regular ' Confederate troops . And when things begin to really heat up around their own town , Jack Bull Chiles ( Skeet Ulrich ) and Jake Roedel ( Tobey Maguire ) form a band of their own and join in the fray , doing damage to the Union cause wherever it is practicable . Jack Bull and Jake do not like the War and do not like killing ; but they are standing up for what they believe to be right .   There are others , however , even among their own , men like the young Pitt Mackeson ( Jonathan Rhys - Meyers ) , who will use the conflict as a vehicle for personal gain and as nothing more than an excuse to express their own violent nature through unnecessary brutality , perpetrated in many instances against innocent victims . And so , for Jack Bull and Jake , as well as many just like them , it becomes a time in which loyalty and moral judgments will be sorely tested ; a time during which their souls will be tempered in blood . And they will have to ride with the very Devil himself , against seemingly insurmountable odds . As with all of his films , director Ang Lee approaches his story through an incisive , yet subtle examination of the traditions , cultural aspects and moral attitudes of the people and times he is depicting . And in so doing , Lee provides his audience with at least some understanding of his subject that goes beyond the actual story and ultimately offers , perhaps , a deeper grasp of the motivations that propel his characters and the drama in which they are engaged . Whether it 's the traditions and customs that account for the relationship between a father and his daughters ( ` Eat Drink Man Woman ' ) , the effects of class distinction ( ` Sense and Sensibility ' ) , the honor and code by which a warrior lives and dies ( ` Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon ' ) or the moral ambiguities fostered by a lack of all of the above ( ` The Ice Storm ' ) , Lee infuses his films with insights into the human condition that take them to a higher level . This film is no exception ; and ( as he does with all his films ) , Lee presents his story with the aid of breathtaking cinematography ( in this film , by Frederick Elmes , who also did ` The Ice Storm ' brilliantly ) , which under his guidance is nothing less than visual poetry . It 's that special Lee touch , and it adds a wistful , reflective sense to whatever story he is telling , which is one of the elements that make his films so memorable . As Jake , Tobey Maguire initially brings a sense of youthful innocence to the film that contrasts so effectively with the maturity he conveys later on as the story develops , and his character along with it . Most importantly , Maguire convincingly and believably responds to the events that unfold around him , which adds to the credibility of the overall film and underscores the realism of the presentation : His stoic acceptance of death and the news of those ` murdered ' in the various skirmishes and battles ; the moral propriety to which those he encounters adhere , even in such troubled times ; the betrayal , which because of the nature of the conflict is almost commonplace ; and the loyalty and beliefs to which he and his companions cling adamantly . It is all of this that Maguire achieves through his performance , and it is no small accomplishment . It is , however , the kind of studied , understated performance that is often taken for granted , which is unfortunate ; work like this is worthy of acclaim , and should be recognized . Skeet Ulrich is effective , as well , as Jack Bull , and Jewel ( in her motion picture debut ) turns in an engaging performance as Sue Lee Shelley . It is Jeffrey Wright , however , who stands out in a notable supporting role as Daniel Holt , as well as Jonathan Rhys - Meyers , who brings a chilling Christopher Walken - like menace to his role of Pitt . Also , in what amounts to a cameo role ( one scene ) , Mark Ruffalo leaves an indelible impression with very little screen time . The supporting cast includes James Caviezel ( Black John ) , Simon Baker ( George Clyde ) , Tom Guiry ( Riley ) , Tom Wilkinson ( Orton Brown ) , John Ales ( Quantrill ) , John Judd ( Otto Roedel ) and Kathleen Warfel ( Mrs. Chiles ) . The Civil War will forever be an open wound upon the nation ; but hopefully , as time goes on , it will be through the objective contemplations of filmmakers like Ang Lee and films like ` Ride With the Devil ' that will ultimately help to close the schism and promote healing . In light of more recent events , it is something that is sorely needed , worldwide . Film is a powerful medium ; it can be educational as well as entertaining , and perhaps in the future more filmmakers , like Ang Lee , will embrace and promote a sense of unity through the sensitive depiction of the events and attitudes that make us what we are . 8/10 .      
neg	Van Dien must cringe with embarrassment at the memory of this ludicrously poor film , as indeed must every single individual involved . To be honest I am rather embarrassed to admit I watched it from start to finish . Production values are somewhere between the original series of ' Crossroads ' and ' Prisoner Cell Block H ' . Most five year olds would be able to come up with more realistic dialogue and a more plausible plot . As for the acting performances , if you can imagine the most rubbish porno you have ever seen - one of those ones where the action is padded out with some interminable ' story ' to explain how some pouting old peroxide blonde boiler has come to be getting spit - roasted by a couple of blokes with moustaches - you will have some idea of the standard of acting in ' Maiden Voyage ' . Worse still , you ca n't even fast forward to the sex scenes , because there are n't any . An appallingly dreadful film .
pos	We viewed the vcr and found it to be fascinating . Not knowing anything about this true story , I thought : " Oh , no , P.Brosnan as an American Indian ( ' red ' Indian in the film ) , what a bad choice " until I discovered the truth about Grey Owl . The film does a good job of demonstrating the dignity of these native peoples and undermining the racist myths about them . And Annie Galipeau , WOW , what a beauty , and very convincing as an Indian woman ( I believe she is French - Canadian ; she sure reverts to the all - too familiar speech of such ) . In spite , of Brosnan 's detached , grunting style , in the end he comes through convincingly as a passionate , dedicated man . The plot is a little weak in demostrating his conversion from trapper to animal coservationist . Good film , highly recommended .
neg	OVERALL PERFORMANCE : - At last the long waiting AAG hits the screens . Unfortunately , it could n't set progressive fire in the audience . The first best thing to talk about the movie is The idea of remaking the mighty SHOLAY . And Varma made a nice choice of changing the total backdrop of the movie . If he repeated the same Ramghad backdrop , people will again say there is nothing new in this . Different background is appreciative but the way he presented it is not worthy . Right from the start of his career with SIVA in Telugu , he had been using the same lighting and kind of background . I seriously dunno this guy Varma considers about lighting or not or may be he has no other lighting technique other than like gordon willis GODFATHER . It 's all DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH . Why would some body use so many Dutch angles and extreme closeup shots ! ! ! ! ! ! ! The shot division is lame . Characters could n't carry an emotion , performances are not to their mark , Storytelling is worse , Background is really really terrible . Babban:- Amitabhz been over prioritized to his job . VARMA produced great villains like Bikumatre , Bhavtakur Das , Mallik Bhai but this time he failed in carving the all time best characters of Hindi Cinema . There 's no comparison of Gabbar with Babban . Babban is a more psycho rather than a villain , still he has a soft corner for his brother ( It 's a gift in this movie ) . Amitabhz performance is not to his mark . His appearance itself is pathetic . The scar on his nose , symbolizes forgotten villains of black and white cinema . What ever they worked on Babban is not successful . Babban is no comparison with Gabbar . Narsimha:- The first best thing about this character is not to put audience in suspense about his hands . If varma did that , it would be like teaching ABCD to a Bachelor degree holder . Itz good he opened the secret early . But the flashback is pathetic . Varma could n't use a great actor like mohanlal to his mark . Durga:- The only character with betterment . This character has been improved with satisfactory changes and was used according to the story . Heroo , Raj , Ghunguroo:- No body bothers or at least considers these character . The utter failure of movie starts when director could not work on the close friendship between our heroz . These characters carry nothing to this movie . RAMGOPALVARMA:- His quality is degrading , diminishing . AAG totally can be treated as a C grade movie . Sholay is a fire of revenge , problem of a town , meaning for true friendship and highly appreciated nuisance and fun by Dharmendra . AAG never carried an emotion with its characters . Storytelling is too weak that it could not make audience feel sympathy for the characters . Do n't compare AAG with sholay , still u will not like it . If you dare watch this movie . You will be burnt alive in RAMGOPAL VARMA KI AAG
pos	In what is arguably the best outdoor adventure film of all time , four city guys confront nature 's wrath , in a story of survival . The setting is backwoods Georgia , with its forests , mountains , and wild rivers . The director , John Boorman , chose to use local people , not actors , to portray secondary characters . These locals imbue the film with a depth of characterization unequaled in film history . No central casting " actors " could ever come close to these people 's remarkable faces , voices , or actions . I do n't recall a film wherein the secondary characters are so realistic and colorful . As much as anything else , it is this gritty realism that makes this film so amazing . Another strength is the film 's theme . Nature , in the wild , can be violent . How appropriate that the setting should be the American South . Very few places in the U.S. are , or have been , as violent as redneck country . In a story about Darwinian survival of the fittest , the film conveys the idea that humans are part of nature , not separate from it . " Deliverance " is very much a product of its time when , unlike today , Americans expressed concern over a vanishing wilderness . The film 's magnificent scenery , the sounds of birds , frogs , crickets , and the roar of the river rapids , combined with the absence of civilization , all convey an environmental message . And that is another strength of the film . At an entertainment level , the tension gradually escalates , as the plot proceeds . Not even half way into the film the tension becomes extreme , and then never lets up , not until the final credits roll . Very few films can sustain that level of intensity over such a long span of plot . Finally , the film 's technical quality is topnotch . Direction and editing are flawless . Cinematography is excellent . Dialogue is interesting . And the acting is terrific . Burt Reynolds has never been better . Ned Beatty is perfectly cast and does a fine job . And Jon Voight should have been nominated for an Oscar . If there is a weak link in the film , it is the music , which strikes me as timid . Overall , " Deliverance " almost certainly will appeal to viewers who like outdoor adventure . Even for those who do n't , the gritty characterizations , the acting , and the plot tension are reasons enough to watch this film , one of the finest in cinema history .
neg	It is incredible ! ! .. yes , someone before me wrote that it was a time wasting to seat and watch this film .. it is ! Do n't do so ! I 'm totally rankled ! I liked Wesley Snipes , and I founded funny that he played his name 's meaning in a movie . Anyway , I wanted to see this film ( at home only of course ) but now ( just after ) I am absolutely disappointed ! It was his worst movie ever . Inwatchable ! ! Bad actor - play ! Bad cameraman ! Bad scenario ! .. Only one good think : that wonderful girl ! Must be a manikin surely ! Eeeeh ! ! MB .. 10 lines minimum ? ! I do n't want to waste you 're time anymore to read my opinion ! I hope , i was clear and under - stable , because English is not my native method of speaking . So have grate time , and see good films , like i try too .. Peace !
pos	Okay , first of I hate commenting on this thing but I felt like I had to stand up for this movie . So many people were bashing on it and I felt like people who might want to see it should get a second opinion . First off , Bend It Like Beckham is not meant to be the most profound movie of the century . If that 's what you 're looking for go somewhere else . Just because it is an independent film does not mean it has to be artsy . It 's supposed to make you feel good and you 're supposed to have fun watching it and those two things are handily accomplished . Secondly , the acting though not " Halle Berry in Monster 's Ball " is still good . The movie does n't need acting like that honestly so do n't look for it . It 's a family movie . If that 's what you wanted you would n't or should n't even be looking into this movie honestly . Lastly , It has a really cute story . I think it 's thought out well and it 's entertaining to watch . It 's also very true to life for the most part for that culture so if you want to sit down and watch a movie that you can enjoy and feel good about when you 're finished . If you 're looking for something with deep thought out plot lines and big dramatic scenes this is not for you . -Lyndsay
neg	It 's very sad that Lucian Pintilie does not stop making movies . They get worse every time . Niki and Flo ( 2003 ) is a depressing stab at the camera . It 's unfortunate that from the many movies that are made yearly in Romania , the worst of them get to be sent abroad ( e.g. Chicago International Film Festival ) . This movie without a plot , acting or script is a waste of time and money . Score : 0.02 out of 10 .
pos	This is probably the best documentary I have seen in a very long time . Jonny Kennedy was and is still is a tragically beautiful inspiration . Not only was he a survivor of one of the most painful diseases out there , but he used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and never to give up reaching people and spreading his love . Watching minutes of his life long struggle was heart - wrenching . Listening to his smart ass remarks and seeing his adorable gestures was heartwarming . And seeing him smile was indescribable . I feel blessed to have been able to be touched by this tiny giant . Please , if you ever have a chance to watch this film - consider yourself lucky to have met Jonny Kennedy .
neg	This had high intellectual pretensions . The main lead intends to give a " deep " " meaningful " rendering(with voice over for his frames of mind naturally ) and he was certainly influenced by the fifties / sixties " method " -which , when the script and the direction were worthwhile did give stunning results ( see Clift , Newman , Winters).But here the story is abysmal . Besides it moves too slow , you could edit at least 20 minutes -including pointless flashbacks - and the plot line would not be changed .At times , it 's very doubtful that Bruce Dern believes in his " Uncle " character and his portraying often verges on parody . An interesting side is only skimmed over : the relationship young boy / hero -if we admit that the hero is himself some kind of child- When he says to the young kid that he would let nobody do harm to him , some welcome tenderness emerges . But it 's botched and only the final scene returns to it . Word to the wise : Take Foley 's " at close range " instead : it has two great actors ( Christopher Walken and Sean Penn together!),it 's also an offbeat movie , but it 's gripping , suspenseful . Here my hitchcockometer points sullenly towards zero throughout .
pos	I watched part one two days ago and today I saw part two . Of course the two parts are worlds apart so I am a little shaken by all that I just saw . I felt consumed by the knowledge of the inevitability of Che 's death ; for me , it clouded the entire movie . I suppose that is exactly what Soderbergh wanted us to feel , the slowly evolving inevitability of his death . Part Two was so downbeat compared to , again an inevitability but in Cuba it was positive and in Bolivia it was so negative . The politics of the movement in Bolivia were only alluded to but rarely confronted didactically . For me the memorable scenes were all at the end of the film : the confrontation with the jailer and the milder talk with the Bolivian official where that official questions Che about the failure of the peasants to support his revolution . I had not considered the national differences playing as much role as they did in the conflict , Argentine versus Bolivian . I thought Soderbergh dealt admirably with the inevitable problems of supply in a revolutionary struggle ; how do you get food without antagonizing the peasants who do not have enough themselves . I was struck by how hard it would be to try something as Che tried . I guess it is all in the timing ; is there sufficient anger against the government to begin the movement ; in Bolivia there was n't . Che realized the terrible corundum of revolutionists in his letter to Fidel read at the beginning of the film : If not now , when , 50 years from now . A very thought provoking and well done film ; make every effort to see it .
neg	I 'll say it again : this movie was totally lame . Kids will like it , sure , but adults ... doubtful . The whole thing was basically a rehash of the original , which is to be expected , since they pretty much explored the whole concept in the first movie , but still , did they have to completely rehash the entire movie ? I mean , everything is re - done from the Little Mermaid . The worst part of it is Morgana " Ursula 's crazy sister " who appears out of nowhere and threatens Melody , which is ridiculous since Triton is there with his magic trident . Why did n't Triton do anything about it ? Because the plot required him to do nothing . I could go on , but I wo n't . The whole thing is a shameless attempt to rake in more money from the Little Mermaid , and was obviously thrown together without any thought , because they knew it would sell . Overall it is a terrible waste of time .
pos	Starfucker ( which reads Starstruck on my box ) was the most amazing movie I have ever seen . I thought that it was one of the best movies I have ever seen . So why not a 10 ? Nothing is perfect . Jamie Kennedy proves why he is one of my favorite actors in this very interesting look at a darker side of Hollywood . I have forced a few others to watch the movie and they all agreed that it was an outstanding flick .
neg	I desperately want to give this movie a 10 ... I really do . Some movies , especially horror movies are so budget that they are good . A wise - cracking ninja scarecrow who can implement corn cobs as lethal weaponry ... definitely fits this ' budget to brilliance ' system . The depth of the movie is definitely its strong point and the twists and turns it implements , keeping the audience at the edge of their seats really drives the creepy ... ninja ... puberty - stricken ... pre - thirty year old student ... non - cowboy drawing ... wise - cracking ... son - of - a - bitch scarecrow into the limelight as the creepiest horror icon of the year . All I can really say is , ' can you dig it ' and recommend watching movies such as Frankenfish if you enjoy this sort of hilarious horror . ( WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY SMOKING ! ? '
pos	I just saw this movie at a sneak preview and all I can say is ... "What did I just watch ? ? ? ? " And I mean that in a good and bad way . The plot is really simple . Stiller and Black play friends / neighbors . Stiller is the focused , hardworker while Black is a dreamer . Black invents this idea to create a spray that erases poo . The idea becomes very popular , and Black becomes very rich . The extravagant lifestyle that Black gains and the fact that he still tries to be best friends with Stiller causes Stiller to become crazy with envy . As I said , the plot is simple . Everything else is plain odd . The direction is odd , with a weird rotating opening shot to out - of - nowhere sped up sequences . The dialouge and the acting is very odd ; odd in a rambling sort of way . And the sound track is the oddest thing in the movie , from the weird " Envy " song that keeps on reappearing to the scene where you think you 're going to hear a classic 80 's song but suddenly it 's in Japanese . So , the true question is this ... is odd funny ? That depends purely on the individual . I was cracking up at the shear unwavering weirdness of the movie . After the screening I heard people call it horribly unfunny and glad that it was free . Strangely , I understood their point . There are no jokes whatsoever , so if you are n't hooked by the uniqueness of it all , you will hate this movie . Absolutely hate it . This movie is destined to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a DVD cult classic . If you can laugh at a movie with no real jokes , like Cable Guy or Punch Drunk Love , then I suggest you see it . If you do n't , run away from this movie . It 'll only make you mad .
neg	Having just recently re - viewed " Lipstick " for the first time in a few decades , I backed it with " Descent " even though I have heard more negative comments than good from other film friends with tastes as varied as mine . It 's interesting to contrast how the unique niche of the Rape Revenge movie has evolved in the past 32 years , from the full - on gore of " I Spit On Your Grave , " to the tawdry sensationalism of " Lipstick , " to the tasteful handling of the issue in " The Accused . " But " Descent , " though making some important points , never really offers us anything truly new in terms of revelatory meaning . No , " Descent " is so poorly made in terms of picture and sound quality that it detracts from any significant message it could hope to make --- a message that , when examined closely , is n't that groundbreaking . I pretty much knew the plot going in . What I wanted to see * was * the " descent " or degeneration of Dawson 's character . Being a big fan of Rosario 's , I was anxious to see the layers being stripped away and her psyche being slowly twisted ... you know , the kind of portrayal DeNiro brings to " Taxi Driver . " Unfortunately , the script and the director / writer 's choices do n't provide any sort of believable transition . The biggest point of failure is the second act . It became obvious what the filmmaker 's intentions were for this segment of club - hopping , drug use , and obsession with big black stallion Adrian ( every white boy 's nightmare , natch ) from a Q&A on the DVD , but this excursion into Dawson 's character is never believably rendered . We do n't know exactly what the hell she 's doing half the time , what she 's after , or why she 's doing it . The poor quality of the audio / video again do n't help , but the sequence is just too damn long and pointless . It destroys any momentum and investment in the lead character set up during the otherwise exceptionally well - done first act . By the time we get to the finale , our interest has already waned . One point of success that Dawson does point out in the Q&A is that by the end " revenge " scene we are pumped for retribution , then realize just how drawn - out and ugly the reality is . While that 's certainly valid , it does n't make the scene any more intriguing . If you have the DVD , check out the deleted " classroom " scene . This is an excellent 8 minute plus outtake that crackles with energy and provocation ( though all verbal ) and really DOES show Dawson 's slow crack - up materializing as she delightfully vivisects poor Francie Swift 's prissy , condescending dorm counselor . If more expository scenes like this had been added and more of the middle third cut down , we might have an interesting psychological study of the impact of senseless acts of violence . As the film stands in the final cut , though , all we get is what we 've seen before , only in a more graphic rendering . So what ?
pos	Old People Show ? ? ? ? I 'm 15 and have been watching the show since I was 12 , recoding it onto my Sky+ box everyday from Hallmark and BBC 1 . I really wish they had n't cancelled it , they did n't even get a proper farewell . But what an adventure , all those episodes , I think I 've seen them all , and not one comes to mind that I did n't like and enjoy . Its a shame the BBC keep swapping between Diagnoses Murder and ' Murder She Wrote'- Never watched it and do n't intend to . Anyways , he characters in Diagnoses Murder are so in - depth , and the chemistry between the actors is amazing . It really was a sad day when they cancelled this show ........
neg	More wide - eyed , hysterical 50s hyper - cheerfulness that gives new meaning to anti - social , pathological behaviour . Danza and Grayson will leave you begging for mercy . It 's a shame that all the people involved in the making of this movie are now dead ( or in nursing homes ) . I kinda thought about suing them for torture . As this movie started unleashing its shamelessly aggressive operatic assault onto my poor , defenseless ear - drums , I felt instant , strong pain envelop my entire being . That damn muscular vibrato can shatter Soviet tanks into tiny bits , nevermind glass . " Why did n't you switch the channel if you did n't like it ? " , you might ask angrily . Fair point , fair point ... The answer is that I wanted to , but the pain was so sudden and excruciating that I fell to the floor , writhing in agony . With my last ounces of energy , I tried to reach the remote but could n't . A silly little fisherman with the questionable talent of singing with an annoying opera voice is discovered by Niven , who then proceeds to " pigmalionize " him . Lanza is in love with asymmetrical Grayson , but she predictably treats him with contempt until they finally hook up . This may seem like a rather thin plot , but this noisy movie is so chock - full of singing and music that there is barely any dialogue at all . This movie is RELENTLESS . Forget about torturing hippies and war prisoners with Slayer 's " Reign In Blood " ( as in a South Park episode ) . Whatever little conversation there is amongst the silly adults that infest this strange 50s musical world , it 's all infantile - as if they were all 6 year - olds impersonating grown - ups . I can only envy people who find movies like this funny . It must be great being easy - to - please : what a world of wonder would open up to me if only I could enjoy any silly old gag as hilarious , gut - busting comedy .   But let 's examine this phenomenon , the 50s musical . My best guess is that 50s musicals offered the more day - dreaming idealists among us a glimpse into Utopia or Heaven ( depending on whether you 're church - going or Lenin's - tomb - going ) , or at least very cheesy version of these fantasy - inspired places . TTONO is more akin to a representation of Hell , but that 's just me . I do n't seem to " get " musicals . People talk , there is a story - but then all - of - a - sudden everyone starts singing for about 4 minutes after which they abruptly calm down and then pretend as if nothing unusual happened ! When you think about it , musicals are stranger than any science - fiction film . Worse yet , TTONO ( my favourite type of pizza , btw ) is not just a 50s musical , but one with opera squealing . Opera is proof that there is such a thing as over - training a voice - to the point where it becomes an ear - piercing weapon rather than a means of bringing the listener pleasure . The clearest example of this travesty is when Lanza and Grayson unite their Dark Side vocal powers for a truly unbearable duet . I tried lowering the volume . I lowered it from 18 to 14 . Then from 14 to 10 . Then 8 . I ended up lowering it to a 1 , which is usually so low that it 's only heard by specially - trained dogs and certain types of marsupials , and yet I STILL could hear those two braying like donkeys ! Take the scene in the small boat in the river . Danza starts off with one of his deafening , brain - killing tunes , and then ... nothing . No animals anywhere to be seen . Even the crocodiles , who are mostly deaf , have all but left . If you look carefully , you might even see the trees change colour , from green to yellow , in a matter of minutes . No , this was not a continuity error , it was plain old torture of the flora . And those trees were just matte paintings ! Imagine how real trees would have reacted . The reason glass breaks when a high C is belched out of the overweight belly of an operatic screamer is not due to any laws of physics relating to waves and frequency , but because glass is only human - hence can take only so much pain before committing suicide through spontaneous self - explosion . I can listen to the loudest , least friendly death metal band for hours , but give me just a minute of a soprano and I get a splitting headache .
pos	Greetings again from the darkness . Mary Heron is amassing quite the list of films which provide a glimpse into their specific era . Her previous " I Shot Andy Warhol " and " American Psycho " were at their best when commenting on the quirkiness of society during that period . Although " The Notorious Bettie Page " is obviously about Ms. Page , it is every bit as much a peak behind the curtain at the world of kinky photo shoots in the 50 's . The film is fun to watch both from the perspective of the story and the technical aspect of the way it was filmed and put together . The grainy B&W film and photos capture the time and the introduction of color in Miami Beach through the photos of Bunny Yeager is very well done . The supporting cast is strong with David Strathairn ( fresh off his Edward R. Murrow role ) , Chris Bauer ( as Irving Klaw ) and Lili Taylor . The star of the film is the wonderfully talented and underrated and underworked Gretchen Mol . Ms. Mol always brings an edge and spirit to her roles . She was absolutely mesmerizing in the little seen , Jason Alexander directed " Just Looking " in 2000 . Here she is the notorious Bettie Page . Her smile is captivating and her body is flawless . She really seems to enjoy this role and helps us understand how the girl next door from Tennessee could become the underworld Pin - up queen . As one would expect , the soundtrack from the era is terrific . Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the featured performers . Although the film hints at providing a history into this industry , the final third kinda falls flat preventing pure movie magic . But the magic of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page make this a fun movie to watch and one that will yield endless showings on HBO in the near future . Now will someone please turn Ms. Mol into the star she should be ?
neg	I saw the movie as a child when it was released in the theater and it was so bad that it became the makings of a family joke . If the ranking had a zero , this movie would get it . The dinosaurs were awful . The storyline was ridiculous . The acting really does n't qualify to be called acting . The only reason I even remember the name of the movie so well is because my family still talks about how BAD it really was .
pos	OK , here is my personal list of top Nicktoons shows as in today : 1 . All Grown Up / SpongeBob SquarePants 2 . My Life as a Teenage Robot 3 . Invader Zim 4 . CATSCRATCH / Rugrats Notice a word with only capital letters ? That means this is the Nick show I 'm going to talk about . " Catscratch " is basically a simple but great animated comedy about three wealthy cats - Mr. Blik , Gordon , and Waffles - who get into weird and REALLY surreal situations , from attempting to join Human Kimberely 's slumber party for root beer to saving a planet of slugs from the evil spaceship . This is one Nick show that you will simply have your funny bone tickled sooner or later ! The theme song is catchy and memorable . Voice actors - including Wayne Knight from the " Seinfield " franchise - brings the characters to fresh life with very quirky personalities . The stories are enjoyable ( fans ' episodes would be " King of All Root Beer " and " Gordon 's Lucky Claw " ) . And the humor is all done in some style of Earthworm Jim .   So in conclusion , " Catscratch " is one of the Nicktoons series , like " Invader Zim " and " MLAATR " , which becomes very , very popular all over the world in just 3 seasons or less .
neg	When I saw this movie , I could n't believe my eyes . Where these hilarious creatures , dustbin muppets with big pointy teeth , really meant to be scary ? Or where they designed to have a good laugh ( I sincerely hope so ) . If you watch carefully you can even see the strings operating them ( better ; dragging them across the screen ) . The whole was rather funny than scary and I had a good time watching the movie because I was amazed by its overall incapacity to have only one good part . It is one big joke from beginning to end and I believe this movie belongs into a new category : So unbelievable crappy you 'll be laughing from beginning to end . ( I 'm not even gon na try to comment on the acting or all the other things )

neg	As a member of the cast , I was a member of the band at all the basketball games , I would like to let the world know after being in the movie , that we were not allowed to see it since it was banned in Oregon . This was due to the producers and the director breaking the contract with the University of Oregon where it was shot . Seems that the U of O sign was shown . While we were shooting , we were allowed to eat several meals with the cast and production staff . Mr Nicholson was quite memorable for being one of the most ill - mannered men I have ever met . Quite a time for a young 20 year old . BUt certainly not what campus life was really like in the late 60 's and early 70 's despite what Hollywood may think . Trombone player from Oregon
pos	I have personally seen many Disney movies in my lifetime , though absolutely none of them match up in any way to Bedknobs and Broomsticks . Although I personally would n't have crossed live - action with animation , it was an improvement on trying to dress people up as animation characters . The movie pits three evacuees from world war two who are sent to stay with a silent and socially awkward woman in the country . I would have to say that the casting was brilliant . Angela Landsbury made a perfect Miss Price , while David Thomilson made a great desperate entertainer love interest . Endings always surprise me and this was no exception . It was neither happy nor sad , though I do not know if this was intentional . The dialog was n't great , but considering it was designed to be a kid 's movie , that is alright . Overall , I would give the performance nine out of ten , the dialog six out of ten , the casting nine out of ten and the costumes eight out of ten .
neg	I understand the jokes quite well , they just are n't good . The show is horrible . I understand it , and that 's another horrible thing about it . The only cool character there EVER was on the show was that one hobo in that one episode , but then I see the other episode including that episode and the show is horrible . It 's not funny , NOT funny ! I do n't want people to say " Only smart people get it " because if they 're so smart why do they judge people they do n't even know and say that they 're not smart or intellectual enough to understand it ? It 's like saying " The sky is red " but never looking outside . But anyways , this is absolutely the worst show I have ever seen in my life , the jokes are terrible , I mean , you can understand them , they 're just horrible , her controversy is very lame , her fart jokes and other jokes on bodily fluids are really dumb and usually consist of really bad acting . I 'm not sure what these " smart " people see in this show , but judging others when they do n't even know anything about any of us is n't exactly a smart comment .
pos	This entire movie is worth watching just for the magnificent final moment - its the best ending of any movie I 've ever seen . Perfect , beautiful , funny , simply wonderful . I found this movie delightful , even with it 's French taking - itself - too - seriously deep meanings thing going on . I loved it - it 's a great love story . And I loved the way Algerians were woven in - and by the way , the music during the final credits is great . I want the CD !
neg	Any person with fairly good knowledge of German cinema will surely tell that numerous films about a young girl having troubles with her mother as well as her boy friend have been made in the past . If such a film is shown to people again , it would surely click provided if it has something new , fresh and captivating for today 's challenging audiences . This is also true for German film maker Sylke Enders as her film 's principal protagonist Kroko has been mistreated by everybody around her including her mother and boyfriend . She is bold enough to face any punishment as she has tried her hand at all kinds of criminal activities including shoplifting . Kroko was originally shot on DV to be blown afterwards to 35 mm format . Its technical virtuosity does not hamper our joys when we learn that Kroko would like to become a policeman as she feels that she is averse to the idea of becoming a run of the mill hairdresser . If someone were to state a positive aspect of Sylke Enders ' film , it may well be Kroko 's involvement with handicapped people as a result of a punishment . It is with Kroko that we learn that punks are human too with their unique joys and sorrows .
pos	This movie maybe really bad , but it is alot of fun . The bad acting and poor direction enhance the film 's hystericalness . The twins are very funny in their Conanesque roles . If you go into this film expecting the first Conan or Excalibur , than you will hate it . If you watch it while in a good mood and accept it as good , dumb fun you will have a good time . Watch for the scene where they try to hang the brothers , its funniest scene in the film . I wish Mystery Science Theatre 3000 would have done this ! !
neg	I 'm not sure if users ought to be allowed to review films after only sitting through half , but I 'm afraid I just could n't stand another minute . If this abject excuse for a film does n't have the late , great GP spinning like a wheel in his grave , then I doubt anything will . The excellent review above ' Not a film for Parsons fans ' sums up most of my feelings . How dare a ( second rate ) director and writer attempt something to which they 're so clearly incapable of delivering . What were they thinking ? Where to start ? THE SCRIPT : I thought I 'd be getting a slice of bittersweet Americana . What I got was poorly executed slapstick with no cliché left unturned . Stupid hippy ? Check . Stupid fat cop ? Check . Awful plot contrivances ? Check . Embarrassingly written female characters ? Double check . Total disregard for the story which you 're trying to portray ? Check . After a while , you realize that what you 're watching is a soap and not a very well written one at that . Scene with Knoxville . Scene with Ex girlfriend . Scene with Knoxville which has n't moved on much . Scene with Ex girlfriend which was a bit like the last one . And so on ... THE DIRECTION : My friends and I decided , after some consideration , that watching this was like watching a bad episode of Quincy , or maybe a particularly poor Dukes of Hazzard . That 's how bad the direction was . Terrible jump cuts , awful camera work , clunky ins and outs to scenes . God , it was cringeworthy . And then I discovered the director was an Irishman who 's most noteworthy recent work is a really lousy BBC Sunday night drama called Monarch of the Glen ( trust me , it 's lowest common denominator TV ) . And then it all made sense ... THE ACTING : Are we now so critical that when some random guy from the TV decides to give acting a go , if he 's not so bad , he stinks , we applaud his efforts ? Knoxville JUST ABOUT manages to get through every scene . Poor Christina A. has no such luck . Her performance is a car crash ( though what you do with those lines , I do n't know ) . The ' hippy ' in the hearse : oh dear , oh dear , oh dear . Have we not moved on since Cheech and Chong ? I could go on , but I think you get my drift . What I would say is that , as other reviews have mentioned , no one on this film clearly gives a flying damn for The Byrds , The Flying Burrito Brothers or Gram 's solo work . They knew nothing about the American road movie and they certainly give a damn about trying to do anything with an admittedly decent story from rock mythology . This film was shallow , failed to explore anything and was jaw droppingly unfunny from beginning to ... oh wait , I did n't quite make the end . And I suggest you stay away too .
pos	Wow I really liked this movie , William H. Macy is great as the quiet hit - man Alex . All the performances here are really good , the plot is interesting and entertaining . Alex , a married hit - man ( like his father)with a little son , is going through a middle age crisis and wants to quit the family business so he goes to the psychiatrist for help and in this place he meets the young free will spirit Sarah of whom he falls in love to . One day Alex does n't know what to do when he gets a job to kill a person he knows .   I recommend you to watch it if you like mature interesting movies . 8 stars = very good
neg	I am very open to foreign films and like to think that I grasp what they are trying to accomplish although some things are lost in translation . But the simplicity and " intelligence " of this film were boring . I 've often thought how interesting it would be to make a movie that just shows a typical day or time period that really had no point . Now that I 've seen a movie like that I will no longer be thinking along those lines . There 's tones about society , racism , and some desire ... but South Park has that . And when I watch South Park it actually moves me to feel an emotion . The closest thing I felt to an emotion during this movie was the yawn I experienced after the first five minutes . I rate the typical movie a seven or above because I love most every film . I gave this film a one .
pos	The simple hand camera both gives some almost documentary feeling to this film , and also relates to the dogma films . Did you ever get bored of those hollywood - style cop flicks with brawny guys who get assignments james bond would be envious of ? Fed up with the married - living - single cop , the divorced - but - family - man , the personified doughnut and the tough hunter ? Ever wondered how the real police work is like ? Well , for germany , this film shows you . Set in the north between west germany and east germany , former DDR , an laid off post office clerk starts her job , fresh from policeschool . She quickly finds her way around the usual customers , and becomes accustomed to life as a policewoman ... but this is not much fun . Other german crime films like Derrick , Der Alte et cetera have dignified officers talking calmly with suspects . These cops here have to deal with the lowest on the social ladder . Good dialogue and realism makes this an interesting view , even more if you know that part of germany a bit .
neg	Fairly interesting exploitation flick in black and white written by David F. Friedman . The lead actress Stacey Walker is well - cast and strangely attractive . She resembles a deranged Renee Zellweger with a bad hair - do . This chick only made two of these films and then moved back to Texas . The music is terrible . One of her boyfriends is played by Sam Melville ( from the TV show THE ROOKIES ) using a different name . Best line in the film from Tony - " Are you putting me on , doll ? None of my chicks put me on " . Good B / W cinematography from Laslo Kovacs ( EASY RIDER & TARGETS & many others ) . Good locales ( cool swimming pool , also used in THE DEFILERS ) . Strange ending but fitting . A 4 out of 10 . Best performance Stacey Walker .
pos	THE BLOB is a great horror movie , not merely because of the vividly horrific images of its nearly unstoppable , flesh - dissolving title character , but because it features a real societal message . It is , in many ways , a " feel - good horror film . " The clever storyline is helped immeasurably by solid performances from the entire cast . The two romantic leads , Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut , bring surprising depth and sentimentality to the proceedings . They are misunderstood but very well - meaning young people , and it 's very easy to root for them . This is a pro - society movie , and its juvenile delinquent characters cause trouble mainly out of boredom , not out of some malevolent character flaw . Steve McQueen 's drag - racing rival almost appears to be an enemy early on in the proceedings , but quickly joins in McQueen 's campaign to save the town from the oozing invader once he sees McQueen 's seriousness . In this way , a character situation that at first appears to be cartoonish suddenly develops depth and human realism . The authorities ' initial skepticism of the kids ' wild claims is proved wrong -- and once the threat is acknowledged by all , all conflict within the society disappears . This unification of purpose , and the validation of the " troublemaking " teens , becomes official when Aneta Corsaut 's father breaks into the school to obtain the fire extinguishers needed to freeze the Blob . On any other day , breaking into the school would be considered an act of vandalism typical of a juvenile delinquent -- on this particular day , it is a necessary action performed by an adult authority figure . At this turning point , it is clear that there are no lines of division between the young and the old . This is an unusual film in that it acknowledges the perception of a " generation gap " but suggests that it is more imaginary than real , and that given a real crisis , people will naturally band together to restore order . " The Blob " is a perfect tonic for the kind of depression that generally comes with a viewing of " Night of the Living Dead " ( 1968 ) . Much has been made of the film 's cheap but innovative ( and effective ! ) visual effects . They are undeniably clever . A lot of the gravity - defying tricks we see the Blob perform were achieved with miniature sets designed to be rotated . The camera was typically attached to the sets in a very firmly " locked down " position ( the lights had to be similarly attached so that the lighting remained steady as the room was turned this way and that ) . These scenes were often photographed one frame at a time as the room was slowly turned -- the silicone blob oozed very slowly and its action needed to be sped up . In a way , this was similar to stop motion photography , but utilizing a blob of silicone rather than an articulated puppet . Even today , the effects are startling and bizarre . A very good film with an exploitative - sounding title , THE BLOB is a must - see .
neg	I saw his film at the Ann Arbor Film Festival . I am a film student at the Univeristy of Michigan so I know a thing or two about film . And Crispin Glover 's film is outrageous . He basically exploits the mentally challenged . Not only is Shirly Temple the anti - Christ ( which I admit is a little funny ) telling the mentally challenged to kill each other , but there is an obsession with killing snails . Crispin also plays with the idea of being in love with one of his actors who is as they all are , mentally challenged . PETA and Human Rights should be all over this thing . It 's not ' counter - culture ' as Crispin stated at the Ann Arbor Film Festival , it 's exploitation .
pos	Stoic and laconic soldier Sergeant Todd ( a fine and credible performance by the ever reliable Kurt Russell ) gets dumped on a desolate remote planet after he 's deemed obsolete by ruthless and arrogant Colonel Mekum ( deliciously played to the slimy hilt by Jason Isaacs ) , who has Todd and his fellow soldiers replaced with a new advanced breed of genetically engineered combatants . Todd joins a peaceful ragtag community of self - reliant outcasts and has to defend this community when the new soldiers arrive for a field exercise . Director Paul W.S. Anderson , working from a smart and provocative script by David Webb Peoples , depicts a chilling vision of a bleak , cold and harsh possible near future while maintaining a snappy pace and a tough , gritty tone throughout . Moreover , Anderson handles moving moments of humanity well ( Todd 's struggle to get in touch with his previously repressed feelings is genuinely poignant ) and stages the stirring action scenes with rip - roaring gusto . Russell gives a strong and impressive almost pantomime portrayal of Todd ; he conveys a lot of emotion without saying much and instead does the majority of his acting through his body movements and facial expressions . Bang - up supporting turns by Jason Scott Lee as brutish rival soldier Caine 607 , Connie Nielson as the compassionate Sandra , Sean Pertwee as the kindly Mace , Jared and Taylor Thorne as mute little boy Nathan , Gary Busey as crusty seasoned veteran Captain Church , Michael Chiklis as the jolly Johnny Pig , and Brenda Wehle as the sensible Mayor Hawkins . Better still , this film makes a profound and significant statement about the spiritual cost of being a merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual strength over physical might . David Tattersall 's polished cinematography , Joel McNeely 's rousing full - bore orchestral score , and the first - rate rate special effects all further enhance the overall sterling quality of this superior science fiction / action hybrid outing .
neg	Every Christmas eve I make my kids endure yet another showing of It 's A Wonderful Life . I also thoroughly enjoyed Bad Santa . So sue me . I admit it . I like cheesy , schmaltzy movies . I like excellent , intelligent ones too , but as with so many things , variety is a good thing . What would the Christmas season be without the annual cinematic ka - ching ka - ching of Santa in all his guises , from Edmund Gwenn to Billy Bob Thornton ? Fred Claus will make no one forget Bedford Falls , but I do not believe a Christmas film should have to reach iconic stature to succeed . " Fred " is a perfectly OK holiday movie , with enough humor for the adults and sufficient charm for the kids . My wife and I laughed a lot , even if most of the humor was obvious and Vince was just being Vince . Paul Giamatti was a top - notch Santa , which helped a lot . Not a great flick , and unlikely to become must - viewing for anyone 's annual Christmas traditions . But my wife and daughter and I enjoyed it for what it was , holiday schmaltz with a small dash of spice . There 's nothing wrong with that .
pos	One of b- and c - movie producer Roger Corman 's greatest cult classics was the Ramones vehicle ( originally designated for Cheap Trick ) , Rock N ' Roll High School . It 's just a simple , technically dated story ( but would serve up extra doses of nostalgia humor considering these were the kind of things that made Napoleon Dynamite characters funny -- see Eaglebauer 's van ) about teenagers who love rock n ' roll . Students at Vince Lombardi High School are met with resistance by the evil principal , Miss Evelyn Togar ( played by cult classic favorite , Mary Woronov ) who fears that Rock N ' Roll turns kids into uncontrollable , amoral deviants and vows to make a Rock N ' Roll - free zone . Actually , she intends to wipe out Rock N ' Roll for all students , regardless of whether its at school , and she has the cooperation of most of the adults who might make the plan successful . But not if Riff Randell ( PJ Soles ) can help it . A Ramones fanatic , she has written some songs ( including Rock N ' Roll High School ) that she wants to give to the Ramones , and in trying to do so , is rebuffed by Miss Togar who does all she can to keep her from going to see the Ramones play in town . It culminates into an ultimate revolt between the obsolete fun - hating adults and the teenagers ( in an ending that is reminiscent of Over the Edge , somewhat ) . After the years of punk , when the fame of garage rockers , The Ramones ( and others ) would mark another shift in music evolution , it was great to see a movie that celebrated the fun of it all and in such a humorous , exaggerated way . It is mostly mild comedy , but a great feel - good comedy nonetheless when you 're in the mood for something more laid back to entertain you . With Jerry Zucker ( of Airplane fame ) and Joe Dante ( of Gremlins fame ) both taking part in some of the directing , you can get the idea for what kind of humor you 're in for ( and not to mention , expect to see Dick Miller even if only for a few minutes in the film 's finale ) . The story must 've later inspired ( and was consequently updated ) by the mid-90s comedy , Detroit Rock City , which some minor character changes in the vehicle for aged glam rockers , Kizz . I would recommend passing on the Corey Feldman vehicle , Rock N ' Roll High School Forever , released nearly a decade later . The original is still the best .
neg	Some people seem to think this was the worst movie they have ever seen , and I understand where they 're coming from , but I really have seen worse . That being said , the movies that I can recall ( ie the ones I have n't blocked out ) that were worse than this , were so bad that they physically pained every sense that was involved with watching the movie . The movies that are worse than War Games 2 are the ones that make you want to gouge out your eyes , or stab sharp objects in your ears to keep yourself from having another piece of your soul ripped away from you by the awfulness . War Games : The Dead Code is n't that bad , but it comes pretty close . Yes I was a fan of the original , but no I was n't expecting miracles from this one . Let 's face it the original was n't really that great of a movie in the first place , it was basically just a campy 80s teen romance flick with some geek - appeal to it . That 's all I was hoping for , something bad , but that might have tugged at my geek - strings . Was that too much to ask for ? Is it really not possible to do better than the original War Games , even for a straight to video release ? Well apparently that was too much to ask for . Stay away from this movie . At first it 's just bad , like " Oh yeah , this is bad , but I 'm kind of enjoying it , maybe the end will be good like in the original . " And then it just gets worse and worse , and by the end , trust me , you will wish you had not seen this movie .
pos	I think this movie is well done and realistic . I you are used to watching Hollywood " action " movies , and use that as a standard to rate this movie , you are bound to be disappointed . This movie is much closer to real life than 95 % of what Hollywood can produce , and that is what lifts it above the average action movie . I have no experience with Swedish military whatsoever , and can therefore not point out any mistakes in the way they act . But as i have seen the " making of " extra I 'm convinced that there has been done a lot to avoid any mistakes . This is a movie i will recommend for others to watch . High quality realistic story and movie .
neg	I happen to have bought one of those " Legacy of Horror " 50 movie pack collections and would you believe I 'm still looking through them to find a good HORROR movie in it . Sometimes you find an enjoyable yet campy one like The Devil 's Messenger or The Devil Bat , or one of the great Alfred Hitchcock 's films ( some are n't horror however and are only on there because Hitchcock directed some horrors and suspense ) but other times it seems that they put movies like The Island Monster and this on because they ca n't accept the fact they would easily be forgotten and should be for that matter . So we open up to sort of a Westing game idea . The rich yet cruel and abusive father played by Carradine ( the one standing feature of this ) has died and left his inheritance to his children and servants who he still hates . Carradine gives a good enough performance as always , but he 's left mainly in a voice recording and flashback sequences leaving us to sit through the mediocre / terrible performances . The rest of the cast either overacts or underacts in scenes . Given this was an independent film of the 70 's the lighting and effects are pretty limited . It 's hard to build a lot of tension when the viewer ca n't see what 's happening that well in some scenes . Some actors like the servants Igor and Elga give an effort at least and I 'm ashamed to admit kind of left me chuckling at the end mainly for the sheer stupidity but still with some very minor happiness that they pulled some version of a twist to an otherwise pretty obvious who - done - it but not enough to enhance the quality of the film . You are n't meant to like the characters as they are either selfish and cruel or psychotic , but it takes it to a whole new level and makes many unwatchable . The death scenes are pretty bad and the suspense is not really there . It proves that you would probably enjoy the 20 movie pack " Chilling " containing films like House on a Haunted Hill , Little Shop of horror 's with Jack Nicholson , and Night of the Living Dead over it . This is best avoided .
pos	This movie is hilarious ! I watched it with my friend and we just had to see it again . This movie is not for you movie - goers who will only watch the films that are nominated for Academy Awards ( you know who you are.)I wo n't recap it because you have seen that from all the other reviews . " Whipped " is a light - hearted comedy that had me laughing throughout . It does n't take itself too seriously and should be watched with your friends , not your girlfriend . It wo n't win any awards , but it just has to be watched to be appreciated . True , some of the jokes are toilet humor , but that is not necessarily a bad thing . Everyone can use some of it sometimes . Some people need to lighten up and see " Whipped " for what it is , not what it is n't . * * * * 1/4 out of * * * * * .
neg	Wanda Nevada is a pubescent fantasy movie using circa 1979 ideas of what constitutes illicit romance for 13 year old girls . Script , pacing , and direction are uniformly awful . Action sequences defy belief . Characters speak with the simplified diction one usually finds in films aimed at the under 10 set , but also includes multiple sexual references involving Shields ' character as well as graphic deaths .   The movie wants to be a comedy on some level but is never funny , an adventure picture but plot and action are insipid , and a children 's movie but introduces pedophilia and child rape as real possibilities . It also wants to be a buddy picture , a coming of age picture , a ghost movie , an Indian spiritual movie , a travelogue , and a western . The overall affect is of massive stupidity with a nasty twist . Wanda Nevada is a complete waste of time unless you want to see a good many terrific shots of the Grand Canyon . That it manages to do just fine .
pos	This one and " Her Pilgrim Soul " are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of Twilight Zone . As I mentioned in my comment on the new series , there 's something lacking in this new series . Maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned . It 's a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than Serling 's version . However , this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too . I think the appeal is that no matter what they do , the lovers can never unite . I remember I was n't surprised by the Korean movie " Il Mare " ( later remade into " The Lake House " . I think it 's because I saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later film .
neg	" This might mean the end of the white race ! " gasps a general as a dozen Native Zombies wander around the battlefields of Europe during the " Great War " . An expedition sets out tor the long - lost , back - projected city of Kennif - Angor to stop this sort of thing and keep the battlefields clear for decent honest white people to slaughter each other by the tens of thousands . It is a bit hard to tell when people are zombies or not in this film as the acting is so wooden . Even by 1936 standards the acting in this film is bad . From a previous decade . It looks like it came out of a correspondence school text book on ' How to Act '   ------------- Chapter Three : Emotions ------------- " How to express fear and loathing ( Female ) Clench both fists . Place fist of one hand on heart . Open mouth as it to scream . Place other fist , palm out , against mouth . Hold pose for 10 seconds longer than is comfortable then quickly turn head 90 degrees away from direction of loathed object and sob " . " How to have difficult , heavily emotionally charged scene with ex - fiancé explaining your love for someone else . Do NOT make eye contact . Do not move . Do not show any emotion . Do not move your eyes too much as you read your lines off the studio wall . "   To give us a respite from the leaden acting the director cunningly cuts in long pauses where nothing much happens except that film keeps running through the projectors . Thus 35 minute 's worth of story is padded out to 60ish minutes . The revolt of the zombies when it comes is so slow ! Released from mental bondage the armies of ex - zombiefied minions turn on their former master by ambling slowly up hill and then sort of stabbing a door a bit and smashing a window . " Yea ... let 's ... oh , I dunnno yeah . Let 's get him grrr . Frankenstein must be destroyed - manana . " ( though I have just found a bit of hidden symbolism . Jagger is shot by a Native as some sort of ironic counterpoint to all the Natives being shot by the Germans at the start of the flick . see , even downtrodden Natives do n't want the end of the White Race ! ) The chase ( it you can call it that ) through the back - projected swamp is hilarious and worth the admission price alone . Roy D'Arcy has a hell of a time camping it up , but is totally wasted , as Col . Mazovia . There is one interesting moment in this film . A nice little montage of the zombied natives and white cast members falling under the evil eyes spell . face after face , cross - fade into one another . It works , though there is a strange little blip in the middle of each close up like a frame has been cut . I guess these must be Neg Cutters ' frames between the fades . Best watched with friends and in a silly mood .
pos	YETI deserves the 8 star rating because it is the one of the greatest bad movies ever made . I saw it at a midnight screening in L.A. and people were roaring and cheering at the insanity - this movie is one of those cinematic trainwrecks where you think it ca nt get any stranger and THEN IT DOES ! The millionaire who funds the project to thaw the Yeti looks like Chris Penn and John Goodman both poured into an ill - fitting suit - the guy playing the scientist is one of the worst actors to ever appear on screen - and yes , there is a mute boy ( who sorta kinda looks like a girl ) and he 's mute ever since he survived a plane crash that killed both his parents ( hmmm- maybe therapy for the kid ? ? ) . Then this hottie Italian girl is seen by Yeti ( once he thaws - which takes FOREVER ) -- and he is instantly in love with her - what is one of the most hysterical things about the movie is that this giant Yeti makes " bedroom eyes " at her - it 's like a large Barry White trying to seduce a groupie . In fact , once the large Yeti picks up the hottie and has her against his chest - she accidentally touches the Yeti 's nipple and yes , the film takes the time to show his large grey nipple GET HARD ! ! ! ! Yikes of all YIKES ! Plus there 's a collie dog in it because the Italian producer must have heard that American audiences like dogs and he sorta kinda tried to get a Lassie - there 's also this insane scene where the Yeti eats a giant fish - keeps the large fishbone and uses it to comb the Italian girl 's hair " Gee , thanks Yeti - now my hair is smooth and smells like dead trout . You 're the best . " This film is more bizarre than something Ed Wood could have ever dreamt up . If you are a fan of classic cinema crap - seek this baby out .
neg	Well then , thank you SO MUCH Disney for DESTROYING the fond memories I USED to have of my FORMER favorite movie . I was about 5 when the original movie came out , and it was one of the first movies I remember seeing . So , now that I 'm 16 , and feeling masochistic enough , I decided to rent this movie . Thus , I managed to poison all my memories of the original movie with this sorry excuse for a movie . This movie takes everything that made the original endearing and wrecks it , right down to the last detail . In this movie , Ariel and Eric celebrate the birth of their daughter , Melody , and go to show her to everyone in the ocean ... BROADWAY STYLE ! After the musical number ends , within minutes , the sea witch Morgana shows up and threatens to kill Melody if Triton does n't give up the trident . Thus , he gives it up without even a fight . Eric stands there gaping , though Ariel figures out how to use a sword and save Melody . Morgana escapes , so Ariel and Eric decide that Melody should never go near the sea until Morgana is caught . Well ... uh , nothing of note really happens . Eric is a total wuss . He never really manages to do anything . Ariel sort of does something . Melody manages to screw things up . Plus , the animation is a new low - point for Disney . The computer graphics wind up clashing with the backgrounds . Ever single opportunity for character development is wasted . The songs bite . Look , do n't waste your time . I 'm pretty sure even the little kids are going to be bored out of their skulls with this , since nothing even remotely exciting ever happens . They wo n't want to sing the songs . If you manage to grab a copy of this , throw it out into the ocean and hope that nobody ever finds it . Ever .
pos	A funny comedy from beginning to end ! There are several hilarious scenes but it 's also loaded with many subtle comedic moments which is what made the movie for me . Creative story line with a very talented cast . I thoroughly enjoyed it !
neg	The power rangers is definitely the worst television show and completely ridiculous plastic toy line in the history of the United States . There is absolutely nothing even remotely entertaining about this completely awful television show . This is simply the worst show ever made , with awful actors , dressing up in multi colored spandex outfits that look completely ridiculous . The owners of this show should be ashamed of themselves , since there is no redeeming value to this nonsense . Kids of today should try watching better shows like the Toy Story movies instead of this garbage .
pos	i really liked the film.at ending i was in tears.this film is incredible.go watch the movie . you will enjoy it.i could have given it ranking more than 10.i liked the teasing between chance and sassy.i like the leadership of shadow.overall this movie was perfect . its sequel is good but not good as this movie.i think there should be a third sequel to it.not only this film attracts children but also adults.my whole family enjoyed this film . Chance was full of humor.sassy is an intelligent cat . again i say THIS MOVIE IS A MUST WATCH.the more u see this movie the more you are attached with this movie.this movie is a classic .
neg	If this is supposed to be the black experience , let me out at either the front or back door . A mama 's boy one day sees 2 young hoods walk by and from then on it 's all down hill for him . Angela Bassett , the one shining grace in this film , plays his over protective , religious mother . Despite her anger at how his life has turned , by the middle of the picture , she really decides to accept this . She allows his friends to come in and suddenly it 's all right to use the profanity as long as it 's not in front of the children . This is a sad state of affairs regarding gangster rap . You knew where this film was heading . I literally laughed out loud when at the end , when Bassett is accompanying her son 's body for burial , she states that while his life had been cut short at age 24 , he had become a man . What man ? He had been a convicted criminal , wrote the most atrocious rap music with constant vulgarity , and scorned society . That scene in the classroom where he tells a teacher that as a sanitation worker , he will earn more than the teacher is a perfect example of what goes on in our schools . The complete and utter lack of respect for the teacher . The east coast , west coast gang rap rivalry is never fully explained . All we see are guns blazing . A terrible picture doing nothing to prevent gang violence . What horrible role models are these rap singers and their foul music . The African American community should take umbrage at their very being . Who was this classless fat slob who portrayed Biggie ? He made Rerun from the old television show look thin by comparison . I know it was the streets of Bedford Stuyvesant that changed this chubby little boy into the vulgar monster that he was . What a sorry state of affairs when this is called motion picture entertainment .
pos	It was considered to be the " Swiss answer to the Lord of the Rings " , but it is much more than that . It is n't an answer to anything , it 's in itself something new , something funny and sometimes it 's downright stupid and silly - but was Monty Python any different than silly ? The beginning immediately makes the statement that this film is low budget and not meant to be taken entirely seriously . Cardboard clouds on strings knock into the airplane in which the main character is seated . But , to compensate the missing special effects , the landscape does the trick . It is absolutely beautiful and stunning - who needs New Zealand , Switzerland has it all .   What I liked about the film was the simple approach and the obvious passion and energy that went into it . It is n't brilliant ; yet it 's got some good humorous parts . Edward Piccin as Friedo is absolutely convincing , it would be enough to go and see the film because of him!There are some good jokes , some of them are very lame , some of them wo n't be understood by people outside of Switzerland . I liked the idea of having " Urucows " instead of Uruk Hai ; I loved the scene where Friedo decides to take " Pupsi " , a telehobbie , with him on the journey . Also very funny is the scene when Rackaroll , the sword - fighting knight , decides to show off with his sword - and subsequently smashes it into a wall , breaking it . And there is this one scene where the " nazgul - ish " characters do a wonderfully comic scene that includes a toilet brush ... I did n't approve of the idea of the Ring being used by Schleimli , the " Gollum " character , in order to " seduce " the ladies . That was a bit far fetched . The idea of Lord Sauraus wanting to cover the lands with fondue was n't that brilliant either . Original , certainly , but not brilliant . But most of all did I dislike the idea of a gay dragon , that really was n't necessary . All in all I recommend to see the film simply because it is so crazy and totally trashy . Do n't expect a LotR parody like " Spaceballs " was for Star Wars . But if you go to the flicks thinking that this is going to be an amusing evening out , with absolutely no ambitions , then you 'll enjoy . I am not sure if it works in other languages , because it does live from the Swiss dialects as well as from the jokes and actors . All in all : hat off to the courage of the Swiss crew who did that !
neg	Oh man . If you want to give your internal Crow T. Robot a real workout , this is the movie to pop into the ol' VCR . The potential for cut - up lines in this film is just endless . ( Minor spoilers ahead . Hey , do you really care if a film of this quality is " spoiled ? " ) Traci is a girl with a problem . Psychology has developed names for it when a child develops a sexual crush on the opposite - sex parent . But this girl seems to have one for her same - sex one , and I do n't think there 's a term for that . It might be because her mother Dana is played by Rosanna Arquette , whose cute overbite , neo - flowerchild sexuality and luscious figure makes me forgive her any number of bad movies or unsympathetic characters . Here Dana is not only clueless to her daughter 's conduct ; she seems to be competing for the gold medal in the Olympic Indulgent Mother competition .   It 's possible that Dana misses Traci 's murderous streak because truth be told , Traci seems to have the criminal skills of a hamster . It 's only because the script dictates so that she manages to pull off any kind of a body count . A particularly hilarious note in this movie is the character of Carmen , a Mexican maid who is described by Dana as around so long she 's like one of the family although she dresses in what the director thought would say , " I just fell off the tomato truck from Guadalajara . " Carmen is so wise to Traci 's scheming , she might also wear a sign saying , " Hey , I 'm the Next Victim ! " Sure enough , Traci confronts Carmen as Carmen is making her way back from Mass , and bops her with one of those slightly angled lug wrenches that car manufacturers put next to your spare as a bad joke . I rather suspect than in real life those things are as useless as a murder weapon as they are for changing a tire .   In another sequence , Arquette wears a flimsy dress to a vineyard , under cloudy skies , talking to the owner . Cut to her in another flimsy dress under sunny skies , talking to the owner 's brother . Then cut to her wearing the first dress , in the first location , under cloudy skies - but it 's supposed to be later . You get the picture . We 're talking really bad directing . As for skin , do n't expect much , although Traci does own a nice couple of bikinis .   For those looking for a trash wallow , 8 . For anybody else , 1/2 .
pos	I think a great many viewers missed entirely the fact that this is obviously a parody of western films . This is not a bad movie - it is a clever tongue in cheek take on westerns . I do n't believe this film was taking itself seriously for a moment . What makes this film even more unique is the fact it is centered around 4 strong , beautiful women , two of which are black , one Asian , and a Mexican / Hispanic character . These are n't your usual western women -- they're tough -- they can draw fast and shoot straight . They 're so tough even the bartender is shaking when he pours their whiskey . The plot which moves this story along is typical of westerns -- in the vein of " you shot my brother -- so I 'm gon na get you ! " Only in this western , a woman 's sister has been shot and she 's out for vengeance on the gang who did it . So she goes and rounds up her old cronies from her bank robbing days . One of them , Maria , is not really all that interested in avenging Rachel 's sister , but she is motived by the fact there 's gold and jewelry hidden in the town where they 're headed . There are a couple of scenes that do n't quite make sense , not that they interfere that much , they can be ignored , but I wondered why they were there . So the film could use a little tightening , but over all , this is a well made film that has failed to find an audience that recognized what it is . My only disappointment was that the only lesbian in the film is a villain -- of the " heroines " , one is obviously straight , the others sexual orientations are never disclosed . 7 Stars
neg	It is unbelievable that a script as cliché and completely absurd could make any screen even the small one . The dialogue in this movie makes Catwoman seem like a high culture classic . Billy Zane plays the bad ass harmonica playing , Elvis impersonating , gunslinging , martial arts master who gambles on the life of a down - an - out former football player turned gambling addict played by the winner of NBC 's craptastic show " Next Action Star . " His performance is as cold as ice and not in a cool way . The " film " takes place in Vegas , and since people play poker there the writers felt it was a perfect setting for a movie about a guy trying to survive 24 hours against an omnipresent , wealthy gambler who has offered his target $ 2.4 million if he can make it through the day . And so the hunt ensues . A hunt reeking with unimpressive explosions , construction yard settings , shoddy cinematography , and one - liners containing the word " bet " or " gamble . " The female winner is also tossed in the mix , but for what reason I have no idea . Oh but do n't worry " NAS " fans the losers make their memorable cameos as well . The surprise ending will knock your socks off if you love predictability or plagiarism . Joel Silver should reevaluate his decision to sell out even more . I wish he could give me those two hours of my life back .
pos	Time paradoxes are the devil 's snare for underemployed minds . They 're fun to consider in a ' what if ? ' sort of way . Film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of films and television including ' Star Trek : First Contact ' , the ' Back to the Future ' trilogy , ' Bill and Ted 's Excellent Adventure ' , ' Groundhog Day ' and the Stargate SG1 homage , ' Window of Opportunity ' . Heinlein 's ' All You Zombies ' was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first time . In the case of Terry Gilliam 's excellent film , ' 12 Monkeys ' , it 's hard to establish what may be continuity problems versus plot elements intended to make us re - think our conception of the film . Repeated viewings will drive us to different conclusions if we retain an open mind . Some , seeing the film for the first time , will regard Cole , played by Bruce Willis , as a schizophrenic . Most will see Cole as a man disturbed by what Adams describes as ' the continual wrenching of experience ' visited upon him by time travel . Unlike other time travel stories , ' 12 Monkeys ' is unclear as to whether future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past . Cole tells his psychiatrist , Railly ( Madeleine Stowe ) , that time can not be changed , but a phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists AFTER he has been sent back to 1996 , in his own personal time - line . Even this could be construed as an event that had to happen in a single time - line universe , in order to ensure that the time - line is not altered ... Cole has to die before the eyes of his younger self for fate to be realized . If that 's the case , time is like a fluid , it always finds its own level or path , irrespective of the external forces working on it . It boggles the mind to dwell on this sort of thing too much . If you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time , as we see on board the plane at the end of the film , then that means the future CAN be changed by manipulating past events ... or does it ? The film has probably led to plenty of drunken brawls at bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians
neg	Massacre is a film directed by Andrea Bianchi ( Burial Ground ) and produced by legendary Italian horror director Lucio Fulci . Now with this mix of great talent you would think this movie would have been a true gore fest . This could not be further from that . Massacre falls right on its face as being one of the most boring slasher films I have seen come out of Italian cinema . I was actually struggling to stay awake during the film and I have never had that problem with Italian horror films . Massacre starts out with a hooker being slaughtered on the side of the road with an ax . This scene was used in Fulci 's Nightmare Concert . This is n't a bad scene and it raises your expectations of the movie as being an ax wielding slaughter . Unfortuanitly , the next hour of the movie is SO boring . The movie goes on to a set of a horror film being filmed and there is a lot of character development during all these scenes but the characters in the movie are so dull and badly acted your interest starts to leak away . The last 30 minutes of the movie are n't so bad but still could have been much better . The gore in the movie was pathetic and since Fulci used most of the gore scenes in Nightmare Concert there was nothing new here . The end of the movie did leave a nice twist but there was still to much unanswered and the continuity falls right through the floor . This was n't a very good film but for a true Italian horror freak ( like myself ) this movie is a must have since it is very rare . 4/10 stars
pos	I saw this 25 years ago on PBS . It was very difficult to watch . So real . To watch this small family struggle in the winter was heart rending . No time for courting : fate has thrown us together and we put our shoulders to the grindstone and make it work . This was based on the woman 's actual diary , which I read many years later . She said in her diary that her parents died when she was little and all their bothers and sisters had to work the farm to feed themselves . She learned to mow , which was not lady - like . She was afraid that no prince charming would want a woman with sun - browned , calloused hands , but this husband was so happy that his new wife knew how to mow , and she was happy to do it . Both were widowed and together they worked to build a new home . It was so , so sad when the baby died . Of course , if they had it today , I am sure it would have been fine . That only makes the tragedy extra sad . I was crying so hard . But then they went out and successfully pulled out a new calf . Spring is on its way , and life goes on . In her diary , she did have two more boys and they lived .
neg	Pros : Nothing Cons : Everything Plot summary : A female reporter runs into a hitchhiker that tells her stories about the deaths of people that were killed by zombies . Review : Never in my life have I come across a movie as bad The Zombie Chronicles . Filmed on a budget of what looks to be about 20 bucks , TZC is a completely horrible horror movie that relies on lame , forgetable actors whom could n't act to save their lives and gore that 's more gross than frightening . How does a movie like this even get made ? Simply put , avoid TZC like a sexually - transmitted disease . My last 2 cents : Humorously enough , this movie was made by a movie company called Brain Damage Films . They 're brains must have really been damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like this . My rating : 1 out of 10(If it were up to me , this movie would get the rating of negative bajillion )
pos	I really loved this movie and so did the audience that I saw it with in Los Angeles . After the film , lots of people were crying and saying how much the film had affected them . I can see why it was such a huge hit in its homeland , Sweden . The film is masterfully directed and each character brilliantly drawn so that by the end you really know these people and care about them . The music is very natural and the main song in the film quite heartbreaking but inspiring . Would definitely recommend this film for everyone to see - even people who do n't normally go to subtitled films . Definitely deserved the Oscar Nomination because of the profound themes of the film reflected without pretension in a small - town community with everyday people . It is a film that unites us in this divided world and shows us the potential of the human spirit . A MUST SEE !
neg	Yikes did this movie blow . The characters were weak , the plot weaker . I figured this could n't be too bad because it has Christoper Walken , oops . He must have done this because he was bored and needed the money . The characters were supposed to be Irish but noone had an Irish accent . I am desperately trying to find something nice about this , I ca n't except Walken did a fine job with a wooden character . Find something to read , or watch discovery , do n't ever see this movie .
pos	When I bought my Toy Story tape when it came out to Video after being released in theaters I saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of Toy Story . As soon as I saw that I knew this was gon na be a good feature ! I was right ! A Bug 's Life like Toy Story is great story , great characters and great animation . My favorite characters are Dim the rhino Beetle voiced by Brad Garrett and Hemlich the Caterpillar voiced by the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft . My favorite scene is when Slim the walking stick ( David Hyde Pierce ) lifts up Hemlich trying to distract the Bird and Hemlich 's like You hoo Mr. Early Bird . How about a nice tasting worm on a stick and Slim 's like I 'm going to snap ! I 'm going to snap ! I just died laughing at that scene . Being a big fan of insects I think A Bug 's Life is my favorite Pixar even though I know a lot of people consider it the worst Pixar film ever ! I do n't know how you could hate a Pixar film ! I think they 're all pretty good films ! Good job PIXAR !
neg	The sitcom " The league of Gentlemen " follows the lives of several bizarre inhabitants of the fictional village " Royston Vasey " . The different scenes are linked together by their common setting . In the first series , a sketch show , the main plot deals with a new road which is going to be built through Royston Vasey . Consequently , more foreigners visit the small town . But Edward and Tubbs , the owners of a " local " shop , which is actually far away from the town , do not like foreigners . Whenever a visitor enters their shop , they kill him . In my opinion some scenes are kind of tasteless and not funny at all , for example , when the couple absorb two engineers who want to build the new road . Edward drums , while Tubbs is dancing half naked around the victims .   Moreover Pauline lives in Royston Vasey . She works at the local Job Centre . Although Pauline hates the people she has to work with , the woman does not want to loose her job . So when an unemployed man gets an interview as fireman , she does not allow him to go because he is not ready for the job yet . Then there is Barbara Dixton , a transsexual taxi driver who goes into great detail about " her " sexual conversion . Furthermore the vet , Mr. Chinnery , always kills animals instead of curing them . In one case , he comes to a farm and is leaded into the sitting room , where a dog lays in his basket . The farmer goes outside . On the assumption that the dog is the sick animal , Mr. Chinnery euthanizes him . A second later , the farmer opens the door , holding the " real " sick animal , a sheep , in his hand . Some more inhabitants are a husband and his wife who are visited by their nephew ( his friend is killed by the shop owners , by the way ) . The couple is very tidy . They have , for example , towels in different colours . Each colour stands for one part of the body . Besides , they have thousands of keys , marked with different colours and precisely classified . In my opinion , the actors play very well . By playing women , the scenes become comical . The costumes are suited to the actors , too . Tubbs is wearing a scarf and some crazy characters , for example Edward , have unappetizing black teeth . The show has a great deal of dark humour , typical British . The set design reflects the mood of the series . The village and all the houses look grey and are decayed . Around the local shop there is often fog which strengthens the threatening effect . Even the village sign is ominous : " Welcome to Royston Vasey . You will never leave . " Although I think that the actors do a great job , this type of series is not my taste .
pos	I thought it was a very funny movie . I love dog movies and comedy movies so combined they were twice as good . K-9 , k-911 , and k-9 PI are my favorite movies . Jim Belushi is hysterical and Jerry Lee is hilarious and adorable they make a great team . The only downside is that i really did n't understand how Dooley 's wife died . She died before this movie but how ? If they said it i must have missed it . Other than that I give it two thumbs / tails up ! Those dogs ( Jerry Lee and Zeus ) must have had A lot of training . They were so funny and all the noises Jerry Lee would make when Dooley was talking to him was so funny . my favorite was when Jerry Lee sang and when he would bite peoples privates to get information very very funny lol
neg	Utterly pretentious nonsense . The material is dull , dull , dull , and most of the cast would n't even have made understudies in Allen 's earlier films . And to have to listen to the unfunny Will Ferrell do his Woody Allen imitation makes me loathe the second - rate ( though mysteriously popular ) Ferrell even more . It appears that the morose 70-year old Allen should have knocked off work when the clock rang in a new century . I truly tried to get involved in the film , but it was just impossible ; my snyapses could n't fire that slowly . So , rather than doze off and kill the afternoon sleeping in an upright position I got up , left my wife and daughter in the theater , and went out to the car where I had a really good book to re - read ( George Bailey 's great tome of 30 years ago , " Germans . " ) The day turned out pretty well after all , no thanks to Woody .
pos	Return To The 3th Chamber is the comedic sequel to the epic 36th Chamber Of Shaolin , in which Gordon Liu played Shan Te , a young man who became a monk and awesome fighter . In this sequel Liu plays a hapless loser who has to learn kung fu after causing his friends to be beaten . He imitates the original Shan Te , tries all manner of tricks to get into Shaolin Temple to learn and eventually gets some unique skills to fight some bullying bosses . Its a classic light hearted martial arts tale , with the ace production values of the Shaw Brothers and the sure footed direction of Lui Chia Liang . The choreography is fantastic throughout , whether for fighting or slapstick comedy and Gordon Liu 's performance , as are the others , particularly the sympathetic monk work perfectly for the material . The film is less epic or profound than some of the stars other work and there are certainly grander , more violent and sweeping Shaw Brothers films . But few have such a magical blend of slapstick , unique training and fighting , with a subtle yet warming tale of a useless guy making good . Full of light hearted joy , its impossible not to give this the highest score .
neg	I am a big fan of low budget horror movies like this , but come on ! This has to be the worst piece of monkey S@#t I have ever seen ! I ignored the reviews posted on this site figuring that it would fall into my taste in horror , but I got bored and turned it off . Let 's see : The wardrobe : Consisted of cheap cameo outfits and painters outfits from home depot . The masks were made from what looks like tin foil .   The Gore : The Gore was pretty good , I must give it that . But Ittenbach 's Burning moon was better for a low budget movie .   Acting : Was horrible ! I did n't mind the dubbing . I find this humorous like in Ittenbach 's " Premutos " ( great movie ) . The fighting and action sequences were pi$$ poor . Bottom line : Do n't watch any of Schnaas 's movies . There are much better directors like Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach with movies of the same gore and subject matter . Check Premutos , House of blood , Schramm and the nekromantiks .
pos	This anime was underrated and still is . Hardly the dorky kids movie as noted , i still come back to this 10 years after i first saw it . One of the better movies released . The animation while not perfect is good , camera tricks give it a 3D feel and the story is still as good today even after i grew up and saw ground - breakers like Neon Genesis Evangelion and RahXephon . It has nowhere near the depth obviously but try to see it from a lighthearted view . It 's a story to entertain , not to question . Still one of my favourites I come back too when i feel like a giggle on over more lighthearted animes . Not to say its a childish movies , there are surprisingly sad moments in this and you need a sense of humour to see it all .
neg	I really like slasher movies , but this one is truly awful . The acting is lame , the script is bad , and the atmosphere is non - existent . The plot is as follows : a deformed gardener Charlie Puckett slaughters people in a small American town . That 's right - this is the plot . Very original , eh!"The Night Brings Charlie " is n't even gory enough - if the film ai n't gon na be scary , at least they should make it bloody . Avoid this cheap piece of trash at all costs . If you want to see some good slasher flicks check out " Madman","The Burning","The Prowler","Just Before Dawn " or " Humongous"- just do n't waste your precious time with this worthless piece of garbage .
pos	If you really want to know how most of the actors and directors in the Hollywood scene " made it " to where they are , the vast majority will tell you ( assuming they will tell ) that a strange coincidence took place . They happened to meet the right people at the right time and get into the right project which led to other connections and other projects . Quinten Tarrantino took an acting class whose instructor knew Harvey Keitel . Kevin Spacey lifted a back stage pass from a sleeping old woman at the lecture of a famous playwright who helped him land an important role . And Robin Williams credits his career to Gary Marshall 's son who , after having seen " Star Wars " , suggested to his father that an alien should visit the Cunninghams of " Happy Days " . These coincidences , many times viewed as pure luck , shapes many of the careers in Hollywood today . Or is it pure luck ? Is possible something else is going on ? " Grand Canyon " written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan , proposes an altogether different explanation for the inexplicable , aka the strange miraculous coincidence . The movie concerns several different characters whose lives intersect because of positive and yet inexplicable happenstance . Kevin Kline , a middle - aged father , experiences a break - down in one of the more dangerous areas of LA . After he phones a tow truck , a young gang accosts him . They threaten violence if he does n't leave his car . Just before the confrontation can escalate , Danny Glover appears as the tow truck driver and dampens the intentions of the gang . Although Glover denies it later , he probably saved Kline 's life . A producer ( Steve Martin ) of cheap violent films gets shot in the leg and after wards has a spiritual experience . He then announces retirement from producing blood and gore entertainment . And Kline 's wife , Clair ( Mary McDonnell ) , while on a morning jog , finds a baby hidden in some foliage . She claims the baby cried for her and that her " rescue " of the infant was preordained . The movie explores further the results of these strange connections that lead to further relationships , end to relationships , and new beginnings . And all the while , a strange homeless man appears throughout the movie as if somehow he is also connected to everything that is going on . It is very rare in Hollywood , or for film in general , to explore such a purely esoteric subject . There are a few moments that seem somewhat unbelievable , but maybe that 's the point . What makes the film work is the superb acting by the cast . Although the miracles and coincidences may seem far - fetched , the actors make you believe they are experiencing these new realities . Maybe this is a subject we should explore more often .
neg	The cover on the DVD and disc is freaking awesome , you would think they made a movie about sweet tooth from twisted metal black which is still a really great idea , but this movie 's actors are worst then Ben 's performance in pearl harbor , porno 's have better quality and better actors . i was gon na buy the DVD but luckily i rented it first , the plot and script are also horrible , nothing seems to go to together so the movie really never makes sense . The poor attempts to frighten you using flashback scenes are worse then ones used in 80 's sitcom shows and in the end it 'll leave you wanting to bang your head against the wall of your house .
pos	No , this is not no Alice fairy tale my friends ! This ` Wonderland ' fable is based on the true story of the gruesome bloody Wonderland murders that occurred back in 80 's California . At the center of this bloodbath was no other than ` Johnny Wad ' himself . Yes , John Holmes ! Daddy ding - dong used other shotguns than his infamous 13-inch milk machine . Besides being a legendary adult film actor , Holmes was as also a hardcore drug addict who befriended various Hollywood junkies . Val Kilmer was occasionally majestic as Holmes , but for once this Holmes character did not milk it through completely . The film possesses a ` who 's who ' of supporting players : Josh Lucas & Dylan Mcdermott as Hollywood riffraffs , Kate Bosworth & Lisa Kudrow as the women in Holmes life , and Eric Bogosian as a menacing Tinsletown entrepreneur . These characters do play integral parts , directly or indirectly , in the ` Wonderland ' murders . Out of this support group , it was Josh Lucas who was the most fierce & impressive as the ardent Ron Launius . Lucas is gradually escalating into a major Hollywood player with such charismatic turns in ` A Beautiful Mind ' & ` Sweet Home Alabama ' . Director James Cox sometime proved to be a bit of a coxsucker by displaying a vast amount of overextended scenes , just like Holmes ' famous organ . Holmes was eventually acquitted of the ` Wonderland ' murders . He died of complications from the Aids virus . ` Wonderland ' will keep you wondering what really happened that bloody night , and if Holmes really laid out his weapon . Oops ! Wrong Holmes movie ! Ok ! That is enough before I get ` penislized ' I mean penalized . Bye Holmies ! * * * Average
neg	There are probably more people afraid of the dentist than of , let 's say , little monsters or scary looking dolls . Which makes it a perfect subject for a horror movie , really . Dr. Feinstone ( Corbin Bernsen ) has been a successful dentist for several years now , but when he catches his wife cheating on him with the poolguy he snaps , and he brings his anger and frustration to his work . Well , give a mad dentist a drill and a mouth , and you can probably guess what happens next ... As I said , brilliant idea but not delivered as well as it should . In particular the ending is a huge let down . Last note : watch for Mark Ruffalo ( You Can Count On Me , Eternal Sunshine ... ) in this one . 5/10 .
pos	I watched this show on the basis of it being told it was reminiscent of David Lynch 's Twin Peaks - a show which I adore . The show quickly starts introducing us to the main characters and rather unusually the pilot episode is to me the best of the lot , its extremely dramatic and really gets out the whole evil side of the show ready to progress throughout the rest of the season . My one biggest criticism is I felt a little let down by the show - probably not through its own fault , as it got cancelled after a mere 1 season , it seemed to display show much potential and it deserved a lot better treatment than it got . The acting is excellent , and this show has some of the best characters ( good and evil ) in it I have ever seen that are well developed in a short space of time . There is the odd cheesy effect for the first 5 or ten shows which are a bit overly dramatic , but this is rectified as the season progressed . Well worth a watch , definitely something out of the ordinary !
neg	I have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago , and one thing surprised me so negatively that I could not see any redeeming virtues in the movies : Dennis Quaid was cast as a policeman that never smiles or grin , while his smile and grin are two of his trademarks . Danny Glover was cast as the bad guy , but - again - most viewers ' imagination could not go far enough as to believe him in that role . Also , Jared Leto was not believable as the former medicine student . The tension was just not there , since the killer was known very early . The finale was , again , neither dramatic nor tense : nobody around me cared about what was going to happen next . All we could wait for was the end of the movie . All in all , a disappointing evening spent at the cinema .
pos	This is the last of four swashbucklers from France I 've scheduled for viewing during this Christmas season : the others ( in order of viewing ) were the uninspired THE BLACK TULIP ( 1964 ; from the same director as this one but not nearly as good ) , the surprisingly effective LADY Oscar ( 1979 ; which had originated as a Japanese manga ! ) and the splendid CARTOUCHE ( 1962 ) . Actually , I had watched this one not too long ago on late - night Italian TV and recall not being especially bowled over by it , so that I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed it this time around ( also bearing in mind the baffling lack of enthusiasm shown towards the film here and elsewhere when it was first announced as an upcoming DVD release from Criterion ) . Incidentally , FANFAN LA TULIPE has quite a bit in common with the afore - mentioned CARTOUCHE : not just cast and crew members ( producers Georges Dancigers and Alexandre Mnouchkine , cinematographer Christian Matras , actor Noel Roquevert ) but plot - wise as well  in fact , the hero is a womanizing soldier ( Jean - Paul Belmondo 's Cartouche had also had a brief military spell ) who 's loved by a fiery girl ( in this case , gypsy Gina Lollobrigida ) while he 's himself obsessed by an impossible love ( here , it 's none other than the king 's daughter ) ! As in the later film , too , Fanfan ( an ideally cast Gerard Philipe who , ironically , is so full of life here that one finds it hard to believe that he would be stricken down by cancer within 7 years ' time ) is flanked by two fun - loving yet cowardly men ( one of them is actually his superior officer and the heroine 's own father ) and opposed by an unscrupulous figure within his own ranks ( the ageing Roquevert , with whom the hero eventually engages in a rooftop duel since he too has amorous designs on the gypsy girl ) ! ; for the record , Lollobrigida will rejoin Philippe in her next film , Rene Clair 's delightful romantic fantasy LES BELLES DE NUIT ( 1952 ) . FANFAN proved to be a big box - office hit on its home - ground and even copped a surprising ( but well - deserved ) Best Direction award at Cannes over more renowned films like AN American IN Paris ( 1951 ) , DETECTIVE STORY ( 1951 ) , OTHELLO , UMBERTO D. and VIVA ZAPATA ! In fact , its popularity ensured its re - release in a computer - colored version ( presumably for the benefit of viewers who would n't touch a black - and - white product with a ten - foot pole ) and the Criterion DVD itself contains a sample from this variant ; being obviously a foreign - language title , there 's also the dubious choice of an English - dubbed soundtrack but , even if these proved not especially painful to sit through considering , when all is said and done , there 's simply no substitute for the original !   FANFAN LA TULIPE ( a nickname given the hero by a young Genevieve Page as the celebrated Madame De Pompadour ) contains about as much comedy as ( the expected ) action and romance ; while some may find this overwhelming , I do n't agree myself as I enjoyed the sharply satirical narration and , on the whole , this combination is comparable with Jerzy Skolimowski 's equally droll THE ADVENTURES OF GERARD ( 1970 ) . That said , the swordfights here are remarkably forceful for an essentially lighthearted enterprise ( particularly a scuffle in the woods and the ambush at a convent ) and the film itself rather adult at times ( with numerous allusions to sexuality as well as coarse language adopted throughout ) when viewed back - to - back with vintage Hollywood fare as I did now ; the climax , then is quite ingenious : the enemy forces ( who , amusingly , are made to speak in speeded - up gibberish ! ) are depleted by our heroic trio alone , much to the king 's amazement who , as portrayed by Marcel Herrand  best - known for his role of leader of the Parisian underworld in Marcel Carne ' 's CHILDREN OF PARADISE ( 1945 )  is himself something of a lecher . P.S. An Italian TV channel has been threatening to screen Christian - Jaque 's promising CHAMPAGNE FOR SAVAGES ( 1964 ) for months now but , despite programming it three times already ( with a tentative fourth one slated for next week ) , they have yet to show it ; even so , I do have three more films of his in my unwatched VHS pile ( equally culled from late - night Italian TV screenings ) : the three - hour epic LA CHARTREUSE DE PARME ( 1948 ; also starring Gerard Philippe ) , THE SECOND TWIN ( 1967 ) and THE LEGEND OF FRENCHIE KING ( 1971 ; with Brigitte Bardot and Claudia Cardinale ) .
neg	The title alone ( along with the poster ) is enough to give away " The Projected Man " as an obvious rip - off of " The Fly " . And Bryant Haliday , while much better than the typical IMDb review would have you think , is nobody 's idea of an acceptable stand - in for Vincent Price . Although , come to think of it , who would be , unless Micheal Gough was available ? ? Still , if you are in the mood to watch a British " Hammer " style movie with a science fiction theme about a teleportation experiment gone horribly wrong ... well , you still might want to give " The Projected Man " a pass and rummage around in the ' remaindered ' bin at your local Wal - Mart for another teleporter - accident movie . Because this one just is n't all that good . Haliday caught a lot of good natured ribbing from the MST3 K crew for his part in this movie and in " Devil Doll " , but he is actually the best thing in TPM . Maybe he ca n't carry the movie , but he gets practically no help here from the screenplay . The script bogs down any forward momentum the plot may have in a mire of nonsense about funding and university politics and a guy named Lembach and some sinister cabal who want the teleportation machine to fail so they can steal its secrets ... or something . So all the dramatic sequences in the first half of movie involve either phone calls or unconvincing special effects with transparent espresso machines and teleporting rats . Then when poor Haliday gets mutilated by his machine , he has to spend the last part of the film wearing a diaper over half his face and rubber cement over the rest while he electrocutes various Londoners who chance across his path . Tom Cruise and Eric Roberts using bullhorns could n't have made this screenplay work .   Meanwhile all the other actors diligently try to inject life and interest into their roles for this turgid little project , but the screenplay just swallows their efforts whole . The corrupt project administrator frets and fumes and hisses into the phone to his blackmailers , all the while failing to notice that he looks like a werewolf outfitted in a tweed suit and a Tattersall vest . Haliday 's research assistant and ex - girlfriend have the least convincing romance in the history of British horror cinema . His secretary is forced to parade around in her " smalls " . None of it really works or gels into a real movie . And it all just kind of stops dead , leaving the viewer going , " Eh ? excuse me , was n't there supposed to be an ENDING here ? ? " Still , for all its problems , I can easily name a dozen horror movies from the same period that were as bad or worse , and so could anyone else who follows movies ( or who has ever browsed the IMDb " Bottom 100 " ) . I would n't actually pay money to own " Projected Man " , but if it were included in some compilation along with a dozen other movies in a DVD collection , I 'd probably feel OK about having it . It 's a harmless diversion , perfect for a horror movie film festival , to watched with friends while consuming many beers and snacks on a Saturday evening .
pos	The Bill was essentially a cultural fountain from which a beautiful rainbow - haze of socio - introspection emerged , inspiring such famed derivatives as Cop Land , The Departed , The Godfather 3 , and most recently of course , The Wire . With multi - faceted characters and story lines that have been described as ' 4-dimensional Shakespeare ' , The Bill grabbed you by the collars from episode one and just would not let you go . The show covered , anticipated , and even occasionally caused all the major global events between 1984 and 2010 . The most famously prescient moment being episode 19 of series 5 , which aired on the eve of the second Gulf War . Detective Jim Carver 's misguided - and ultimately career ending - drugs raid on Craig ' Fun Boy ' Richardson 's flat in the Jasmine Allen Estate in early 2003 , was widely viewed as a predictive allegory for the coalition 's failure to find weapons of mass destruction following the invasion of Iraq several months later . However , it was the work the Bill did to try and highlight some of the lesser - known problems experienced by police officers that won it the most praise . This was sympathetic drama covering such sensitive areas as helmet - phobia , under - uniform cross - dressing , in - van homosexuality , lost truncheons , casual drunken bestiality ( regretted ) , siren aversion syndrome ( SAS ) , groin chaffing caused by chasing suspects while wearing an overly starched uniform and many , many more issues that still trouble , disturb , haunt and excite officers to this day . The last word should go to one of The Bill 's most famous fans , Nelson Mandela : "  it is no exaggeration to say that I would not have made it through the dark void of loneliness that summed up my last years of incarceration on Robben Island if it was n't for the heart - warming , casual buffoonery of Reg Hollis . "
neg	This picture started out with good intentions , Bacon the scientist out to test the theory of invisibility , and Shue is cute as usual in her role . It all falls apart after that , it 's your typical Hollywood thriller now , filmed on a soundstage with special effects galore , minus any kind of humour , wit or soul . In other words , do n't waste your time watching this . Get the audiocassette tape with John DeLancie as the Invisible Man instead , also starring Leonard Nimoy . Now that was good , and HG Wells is well served , unlike with this mess .
pos	What can I say that has n't been said about " The Haunting " ? It has everything that would make a great picture . Wonderful sets , moody music , and sound design to die for were all in place . The screenplay , though , sometimes boggles the mind in such a weird , surrealistic way . The entire team must have forgotten to read it through , maybe because they were too busy creating cg effects and building gothic sets to notice how weak the plot was . Each member of the cast gives a worthy performance , although with little conviction to the material at hand . Lili Taylor has the most to do while the others mostly react to her . But that 's about it . All I can say is that it was a slightly enjoyable two hours , but you will definitely want more . A lot more .
neg	I 'm not a fan of the Left Behind book series - the books are written at a 6th - grade reading level with a lack of research and understanding of science , technology , and politics . While the books do manage to remain faithful to scripture , their methods of fulfilling prophecy are often ridiculous ( an example is their explanation for the Russian / Arab invasion of Israel ) . Also , the books have an unmistakable preachy tone that will turn off unbelievers rather than bring them to the gospel . Still , I found myself reading these books because of my interest in the events of Revelation . For a similar reason , I watched this film adaptation . I am sad to say that it is a rather mediocre film bordering on poor . The acting is actually rather decent for the most part with occasional bits of poor acting and over - acting . The script is rather bad , though it is hardly unexpected when starting with the novel as a basis . The characters are poorly drawn and underdeveloped . Events feel scattered and disconnected . The dialogue sometimes sounds rushed . At least the book managed to flesh out its hokey conspiracy theory . Here , the viewer is left with an incoherent mess that only makes much sense if one has read the book . The pacing of the film is also very poorly executed with the opening and conclusion seeming extremely rushed , and the middle dragging to an excruciatingly slow trudge that makes it feel padded . The music is schizophrenic . At times , it successfully underscores the mood and sounds fitting for a motion picture . At other moments , it reminds me of sitcom and mini - series music . And still other bits remind me of a poppy MTV soundtrack that just does n't belong in the film . I can give the film points for the scene of panic on board the plane , but that 's it . The other scenes involving the disasters after the Rapture are far from compelling . The film also suffers from the book 's preachiness although its message is n't quite as in your face . In all , I found the movie just as disappointing as the series . This is not the film to rally Christians around it . I hope that this film does NOT get any attention at the theaters next year . It would be more unnecessary bad publicity for Christianity . For an example of a compelling , intelligent , well - researched series based on Revelation that presents a realistic and Christian world view without offending the secular reader ( who after all should be whom a Christian is trying to reach ) read the Christ Clone trilogy by James BeauSeigneur . It 's a great read and is a much better choice for unbelievers or believers who appreciate quality .
pos	Although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is special . If you 've never seen this film before you 'll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers . I was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much Disney 's Aladdin cribbed from the film . They loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makers . I 've given the film an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of ten , which is where a good portion of this film dwells , because in the final 15 minutes the film falls apart in the pacing . Everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end . From the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting . It does n't kill the film , but it does weaken it . Still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale , or even a great movie .
neg	Actress Ruth Roman 's real - life philanthropic gesture to help entertain troops arriving from and leaving for the Korean War at an air base near San Francisco jump - started this all - star Warner Bros. salute to patriotism and song . Many celebrities make guest appearances while a love - hate romance develops between a budding starlet and a painfully green and skinny Air Force Corporal ( Ron Hagerthy , who looks like he should be delivering newspapers from his bicycle ) . Seems the Corporal has fooled the actress into thinking he 's off to battle when actually he 's part of a airplane carrier crew , flying to and from Honolulu ( you 'd think she 'd be happy he was staying out of harm 's way , but instead she acts just like most childish females in 1950s movies ) . Doris Day is around for the first thirty minutes or so , and her distinct laugh and plucky song numbers are most pleasant . Roman is also here , looking glamorous , while James Cagney pokes fun at his screen persona and Gordon MacRae sings in his handsome baritone . Jane Wyman sings , too , in a hospital bedside reprise following Doris Day 's lead , causing one to wonder , " Did they run out of sets ? " For undemanding viewers , an interesting flashback to another time and place . Still , the low - rent production and just - adequate technical aspects render " Starlift " strictly a second - biller . * 1/2 from * * * *
pos	At the start , this one is from England , so , of course , I had 98 % chances that it will be intelligent and very good cinema . I never heard of this film before . From the minute I saw Helena Bonham - Carter , I said to myself : Oh ! Here 's comes the feminine version of My Left Foot . I was right , but I was also wrong . Wrong because the two movies are very differents . My Left Foot was a John Ford alike movie and this one is a Chaplin alike movie ( not because this is funny , but Chaplin at that great sense of melodrama that brings tears to your eyes . ) I was right because in 1990 handsome Daniel Day - Lewis turn a little bit ugly by playing an crippled person and he did it with a great sense of reality . Here , very beautiful Bonham - Carter did exactly the same thing , but with very feminine emotions . The story is well written and it 's very intelligent . For me , miss Bonham - Carter gives one of the greatest woman 's part of the 1990 's , with Emily Lloyd in Breaking The Waves . Gee ! And look at her eyes ! She had the most beautiful eyes of cinema since Jobyna Ralston , Louise Brooks , Michele Morgan and Ava Gardner ! She 's also a true talent , as seen on many other movies . See this one , you wo n't regret it ! And a very fine job by Branagh too !
neg	It is hard to make an unbiased judgment on a film like this that had such an impact on me at such a young age . This is with out a doubt the worst kind of exploitation film . I was unfortunate enough to see this film for the first time in my youth , Iwill never forget it . I thought it was the most horrible movie ever made . I then saw it again earlier this year and was once again horrified . I am not a zealot or one to say what others should and should not see but I did take great offense to the way in which something as horrible as rape was dealt with in this movie . I love lowbrow cinema but this is just plain nasty . Rent some Rus Myer instead .
pos	I just found the IMDb and searched this film and I was moved almost to tears by the comments of all the people who saw this film as I did when 6 or so years old in 1967 ? . I saw it before the Jungle Book so I was Eagle Boy for a few hours and then Mowgli for the next year . I burst into tears at the cinema when the boy turned into the Eagle and always wanted to see the film again . When we got home we had a Roast chicken dinner and I got the wish bone and guess who I wished to be ? My dad then said ' I bet you wished to be an Eagle ' and of course we all know that wishes are broken if someone guesses so more tears and a little resentment to this day for not being able to fly away ...
neg	Yet another insult and slap in the face to gay men everywhere . This lame attempt at a comedy has nothing to recommend it . Once again we have an attractive ' straight ' hero who supposedly ca n't get any woman to be interested in him . Yeah , right ! And we 're also presented with the ' sympathetic , attractive ' gay friend who is actually a fat , balding , ugly old man whom the lead is supposed to find attractive . Even I did n't find him appealing and I 'm a fat , ugly old gay man ( but thankfully not balding ) ! Whatever acting talent there may be here has been thrown away on a bad script , and truly awful direction . Mr. Sneedeker should be banned from filmdom , but then he 's no different than the countless other hacks working in Hollyweed .
pos	This is your standard musical comedy from the ' 30 's , with a big plus that it features some well known ' 30 's actors in small fun cameo 's . There is not much to the story and basically the movie is all about its fun and ' no - worries ' overall kind of atmosphere , with a typical Hal Roach comedy touch to it . Appereantly it 's a ' Cinderella story ' but I most certainly did n't thought of it that way while watching the movie . The story gets very muddled in into the storytelling , that features many different characters and also many small cameo appearance , when the main characters hit the Hollywood studios . Of course the highlight of the movie is when Laurel & Hardy make their appearance and show some of their routines . It 's like watching a movie and getting a Laurel & Hardy short with it for free . Also Laurel & Hardy regular Walter Long makes an appearance in the routine and James Finlayson ( without a mustache this time ) as the director of the short . It 's certainly true that all of the cameo 's and subplots distract from the main plot line and character but in this case that is no problem , since its all way more fun and interesting to watch than the main plot line and the shallow typical main character . The movie is most certainly not any worse than any of its other genre movies from the same time period , though the rating on here would suggest otherwise . 7/10
neg	Revenge of the Sith starts out with a long action sequence that is impressive without being terribly exciting , then gets really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes , with the same horrible dialogue and dull machinations that have plagued the rest of the prequel series . The only thing that improves the proceedings is the slow -- and I mean slow -- build - up to what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader . And when that finally comes , it 's pretty all right . Not great . Not even good . But pretty all right . This movie is being vastly over - praised because it does not suck to high heaven like the previous sequels . Instead it 's just turgid , dull , and routine . But you have to say , wow , those CGI environments are really impressive at times . Bu the lightsabre fights ? They 're all a blurry mess . I think the dark side took hold of Lucas when he started these prequels and no one noticed . This will make a ton of money , but thank god it 's over , this once - worshipped franchise has been beaten down enough . I saw the 12:01 show , and after it , I heard a group of very small kids say , wow that was awesome ! But everyone older than eight all grumbled the same thing : I fell asleep in the middle . It was kind of boring . I just thought seeing the birth of Darth Vader would be better . So said we all .
pos	Three girls ( an all - female media - crew , including cult - actress Barbara Bach , no less ) visiting a small town to cover a festival , end up renting rooms in a house they should have avoided like the plague . Well - made little shocker , suffering a bit from some redundant dialogue - scenes and a rather thin plot - line ( that does n't do very well in hiding its secrets ) . One underlying theme in particular is quite disturbing ( as in : vintage shock - material ) , and this is basically what the film thrives on . Performances & cinematography are pretty much above par ( compared to many other late 70's / early 80 's films in the same vein ) , but what really makes me recommend this film is the fairly long climax - scene in the basement - setting . From the moment that " Keller Junior " character was introduced , his performance made my jaw drop open and it did n't close until the end of the film . A very pleasant surprise to see actor Sydney Lassick ( who was funnily wacko in " One Flew Over The Cuckoo 's nest " , and now utterly demented in " The Unseen " ) take on one of the leading roles .
neg	* * * SPOILERS * * * Let 's start with the " good " of this film -- the serviceable acting of Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton . The rest of the acting is awful ( this is n't aided by the atrocious script ) . The worst culprit is the villain , Buntao , the head of an Asian crime syndicate ( played by Frans Tumbuan ) . I was laughing my head off as he was expressing his " fury " over having lost a bunch of money ; horrid performance . Patrick Muldoon is n't much better , and his " it 's a hostile takeover " line ( that 's the remainder of the title of this film ) was delivered about as badly as one could do it . There are no other main characters , but no other actor / actress distinguished him / herself in this film . We next come to the plot . This should tell you all you need to know : In the original " Rage and Honor , " Cynthia Rothrock , who plays Chris Fairchild , was a teacher in the inner city . Now , she 's a C.I.A. agent ( or was it some other governmental agency -- sorry , but this film was so bad that I do n't even remember ) . Hmmm ... I can imagine what that C.I.A. application process was like . Interviewer : What past job experience do you have ? Chris : I was a teacher . Interviewer : Okay ; you 're hired ! I only give it a " 2 " because of some decent acting and a nice plot twist at the end ( though we know that Tommy ( Muldoon ) , the secret villain , will be caught ) .
pos	A mess of genres but it 's mainly based on Stephen Chow 's genre mash - ups for it 's inspiration . There 's magic kung - fu , college romance , sports , gangster action and some weepy melodrama for a topping . The production is excellent and the pacing is fast so it 's easy to get past the many flaws in this film . A baby is abandoned next to a basketball court . A homeless man brings him to a Shaolin monastery that 's in the middle of a city along with a special kung fu manual that the homeless man somehow has but ca n't read . The old monk teaches the boy but expires when he tries to master the special technique in the manual . The school is taken over by a phony kung fu master who is assisted by four wacky monks . The new master gets mad at the now 20 + year old boy for not pretending to be hurt by the master 's weak punches and throws him out for the night . The boy is found throwing garbage into a basket from an incredible distance by a man who bring him to a gangster 's club to play darts . This leads to a big fight , the boy 's expulsion from the monastery and the man 's decision to turn the boy into a college basketball sensation . Al this happens in the first 20 minutes with most of it happening in the first 10 minutes . Aside from the extreme shorthand storytelling the first problem is how little we get to know the main character until way into the movie . The man who uses the boy is more sharply defined by the time the first third is over . The plot follows no new ground except for the insane action climax of the film . I 'm sure you can easily imagine how the wacky monks will show up towards the end . The effects , photography and stunt work are all top- notch and make up for the uninspired plot .   Stephen Chow has a much better command of plot and comedy writing and this film will live in his shadow but that 's not a good reason to ignore it . It 's quite entertaining even with a scatter - shot ending . Recommended .
neg	This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen . It is ( I think ) a story of a rebellious college basketball player , his tough - but - fair coach , his girlfriend , and a fellow student ( played by Michael Margotta ) who has continual nervous breakdowns . The story goes nowhere , there is zero character development , there is nobody to care about , and the performances , with the exception of Bruce Dern as the coach , are terrible . It is hard to believe how a talent like Jack Nicholson could direct such an awful movie . Make sure to avoid this turkey .
pos	The story - line was rather interesting , but the characters were rather flat and at times too extreme in their thoughts / behavior . More extreme than necessary . Also , I think something went wrong in the casting . John Turtorro does n't really satisfy me playing a semi - autistic chess player , not to speak of the Italian player . Motives were n't very much outlined either .
neg	No spoilers here but I have been a fan since Waking the Dead started but the last series , of which only 3 have been on so far is awful . The stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series . I found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous . As a BBC licence payer , after the show I rang BBC complaints to pass on my disappointment . I 'm amazed that actors of the calibre of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone did n't object to the story lines . These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons , surly they can see it 's lost all direction . It 's a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of Father Christmas ! Paul Bentley , West Yorkshire , England .
pos	" Pickup On South Street " is a high speed drama about a small time criminal who suddenly finds himself embroiled in the activities of a group of communists . The action is presented in a very direct and dynamic style and the momentum is kept up by means of some brilliant editing . The use of a wide variety of different camera angles and effective close - ups also contribute to the overall impression of constant motion and vitality . Samuel Fuller 's style of directing and the cinematography by Joseph MacDonald are excellent and there are many scenes which through their composition and lighting produce a strong sense of mood and atmosphere . Ace pickpocket and repeat offender Skip McCoy ( Richard Widmark ) gets into deep water when he steals a wallet from a young woman named Candy ( Jean Peters ) on the New York subway . She was being used by her ex - boyfriend Joey ( Richard Kiley ) to make a delivery to one of his contacts in a communist organisation and unknown to her , she was carrying US Government secrets recorded on microfilm . Two FBI agents had been following Candy and witnessed the theft . One of the agents continues to tail her back to Joey 's apartment and the other , Zara ( Willis Bouchey ) , visits Police Captain Dan Tiger ( Murvyn Vye ) . Zara explains that the FBI has been following Candy for some months as part of their pursuit of the ringleader of a communist group . In order to identify the pickpocket , Tiger calls in a " stoolie " called Moe ( Thelma Ritter ) who after being given a precise description of the " cannon 's " method of working makes a list of eight possible suspects . Once Tiger sees Skip 's name on the list he 's immediately convinced that he 's the man that they need to track down and he sends two detectives to arrest him . When Skip is brought into Tiger 's office , Zara tells him about the microfilm and Tiger offers to drop any charges if he 'll co - operate with the investigation . Skip is flippant and arrogant . He clearly does n't trust Tiger and denies all knowledge of the theft on the subway . Joey orders Candy to find out who stole the microfilm and then retrieve it . Candy pays Moe for Skip 's address and when Skip returns from being questioned by Tiger , he finds Candy searching his home and knocks her unconscious before stealing her money . When she recovers , Skip demands payment of $ 25,000 for the microfilm . She tells Joey about Skip 's demand and Joey 's boss gives him a gun and orders him to recover the microfilm by the following evening . Skip and Candy are attracted to each other and it 's because of their uneasy , developing relationship that a means evolves by which they are able to shake off the attentions of the police . It soon becomes apparent , however , that resolving matters with the communist gang will only be achieved by more direct action . The depictions of Skip , Candy and Moe as characters that inhabit a seedy world in which they are forced to face considerable risks on a daily basis are powerful and compelling . Moe 's work as a police informer is dependent on her knowledge of the people in her community but also those people know what she does and any one of them could seek their revenge at any time . She appears to be cunning and streetwise but also has her vulnerable side as she describes herself as " an old clock running down " and saves money to be able to have a decent burial in an exclusive cemetery in Long Island . Her belief that " every buck has a meaning of its own " leads her to sell any information regardless of danger , friendships or principles and yet there is one occasion where she refuses and this proves fatal . Thelma Ritter 's performance certainly merited the Oscar nomination she earned for her role . Skip is a violent criminal with no concern for his victims and having already been convicted three times in the past , lives under the constant threat of being jailed for life if convicted again . Despite this , he still continues with his criminal activities and strangely , is merely philosophical when Moe betrays his whereabouts and then later , he even ensures that Moe receives the type of burial she valued so highly . Candy is an ex - hooker and someone whose activities constantly put her in peril but behind her hardened exterior a warmer side gradually becomes more evident . Widmark and Peters are both perfect for their roles and like Ritter portray the different facets of their personalities with great style and conviction .
neg	Kirsten Dunst is terribly overrated as an actress . You can tell always she 's just " acting " . I like Izzard though . Plot is awfully boring . The viewer has no real connections to the characters , never knowing who to really sympathize with , or even care about . Slow , dull movie , with some laughs , but few and not very funny anyway . Plot is not engaging or suspenseful in the least . You can see each plot turn coming a mile away . What is this movie supposed to be ? Comedy ? Drama ? Who cares ? You wo n't by the end of this film .
pos	As of this writing John Carpenter 's ' Halloween ' is nearing it 's 30th anniversary . It has since spawned 7 sequels , a remake , a whole mess of imitations and every year around Halloween when they do those ' Top 10 Scariest Movies ' lists it 's always on there . That 's quite amazing for a film that was made on a budget of around $ 300,000 and featured a then almost completely unknown cast of up and coming young talent . I could go on and on , but the big question here is : How does the film hold up today ? And all I can say to that is , fantastically !   Pros : A simple , but spooky opening credits sequence that really sets the mood . An unforgettable and goosebump - inducing score by director / co - writer John Carpenter and Alan Howarth . Great cinematography . Stellar direction by Carpenter who keeps the suspense high , gets some great shots , and is careful not to show too much of his villain . Good performances from the then mostly unknown cast . A good sense of humor . Michael Myers is one scary , evil guy . A lot of eerie moments that 'll stay with you . The pace is slow , but steady and never drags . Unlike most other slasher films , this one is more about suspense and terror than blood and a big body count . Cons : Probably not nearly as scary now as it was then . Many of the goofs really stand out .   Final thoughts : I want to start out this section by saying this is not my favorite film in the series . I know that 's not a popular opinion , but it 's really how I feel . Despite that it truly is an important film that keeps reaching new generations of film buffs . And just because it 's been remade for a new generation does n't mean it 'll be forgotten . No way , no how . My rating : 5/5
neg	Why is it that everyone who has seen this movie feels it is their responsibility to tell us whether or not they are fencers ? That point is completely immaterial to any argument to be made against this total dog of a movie . I think sports movies fall into two categories ; well made movies about the human spirit and competitions , and ` By the Sword ' . Honestly this movie never could decide what it wanted to be , a touching drama for trying to be your best in life , an indictment of competitive motivation or a martial arts flick . In the end it did n't do any of those convincingly or completely enough to make me give one ounce of care of any of it . For the record I also am a fencing instructor ( and now I am officially as bad as the rest ) . But putting bad fencing in a movie does n't make it bad automatically . I mean look at Star Wars ( Episodes 4 - 6 , good movies , bad fencing ) . I liked those movies . But when you put bad sports into a bad movie for some reason people think that it is only the purists that think it a lame effort . Do n't be fooled by any comments on the smaller issue of fencing . This is just a bad movie . In the end , this movie has nothing for the fencing enthusiast or the movie buff or simply anyone with a pulse and three brain cells . When I see a movie and am forced to think , ` Man , I wish I was watching the Mighty Ducks . ' I know that it is time to bypass the argument with the theater manager to get my money back and see if there is anyone in the lobby that will somehow give me two hours of my life back .
pos	Never viewed this film and consider it a great Classic with great veteran actors . In the period that this film was made , people in America were different , there was no TV or all the modern things we have today , except the Radio and the starting out of great films being made in Hollywood . Sweet innocent tales of young romance between a young girl or guy was viewed differently than it is today . Ann Shirley,"Murder My Sweet",'44 played a young orphan gal who was called Carrot Top because of her red hair and found herself being taken into a home of two elderly folks , who were like two wise owls and watched over Ann Shirley . It was a small town and everyone knew everyone and if anything happened , the entire town found out about it within minutes . It is a down to earth film with nice decent people trying to help each other in a very very simple way of living . Today , it seems very corn ball and stupid , but believe me , this was the way people were in America during the 1920 ' . & 30 's and they were a great generation that loved good family films .
neg	I saw this movie primarily to see Brooke Burke ( as Jill ) , who I had meet briefly in LA at a modeling trade show , in her first feature film . I was hoping to see more of her , but thought she did very well acting her role . Since she is such a beautiful and poised TV host , and model , it was not surprising . I was left wondering why she was killed , and what happened as a result . Maybe I just missed it . I was n't really sure about the genre of this movie , and although I liked the actors I felt like it was for a college audience . I tried to keep an open mind considering horror was n't my favorite genre , but felt like I had outgrown the gags . It seemed to drag out in some places , leave you guessing in some places about what powers the evil professor had , and , like a lot of other films had an unsatisfying ending . Having written a couple of scripts , I know a lot of this is difficult and may come down to personal opinions , how many movies you have seen & studied , and those you relate with at a point in time . In a nutshell , I found it interesting , but not a satisfying plot and ending for me . If Jill ( Brooke Burke ) would have returned through the portal in the end and kicked everyone 's ass that would be a satisfying ending and would earn a higher rating .
pos	This movie is without a doubt a perfect 10/10 .. for all you people out there who are rating this film low grades because it has no " good plot " or anything like that , that s ridiculous , saying that a Jackie Chan movie is bad because of its plot is like saying a porn movie is bad because it has no plot ! you watch Jackie Chan FOR THE FIGHT SCENES , for the action its not so much concentrated on a good story or anything like that , if you look at how he makes movies and compare it to other American films from that era and even later you will realize that Jackie Chan 's movies had over the top fights scenes and not really good plots while American movies had good plots but shitty action scenes compared to what Jackie Chan was doing at the time . Porn is watched for the porn , Jackie Chan is watched for the ACTION , i think you people are rating it bad because there 's no plot because you think that s how a smart movie critic would rate a good movie but the way i see it is a good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained . Sure the middle of the movie was boring , VERY BORING , but put it this way the rest which is all action scenes and stunts very much do pay for all of that . This did change the way how American action movies were created , they have even stollen scenes from this movie . If you want a true man , a true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of Jackie Chan 's , he s pure in everyway . He literally makes American movies look like a walk in the park , and even in TODAYS movies . American movies rely so much on special effects and safety wires and stunt doubles and so much more . Police Story and many other Jackie Chan films are pieces of work of a true entertainer who just goes all out and is very talented in what he can do . a masterpiece
neg	The dialogue was pretty dreadful . The plot not really all that inspired beyond the obvious twist it presents . Not visually stunning . Actually visually annoying at times . Most definitely one of those films you find easier to finish if you keep one finger on the fast forward button . If you could watch it for free , have absolutely no other options open at the moment and you really dig seeing the little poltergeist lady ... well maybe I 'd recommend it to you , but not anyone else I could think of at the moment .
pos	I 've heard nothing but great things about the 2006 television mini - series , " Planet Earth , " narrated by my childhood idol David Attenborough . Nevertheless , whether it was screened down here in Australia or not , I never caught up with it , and when I happened upon the opportunity to see ' Earth ( 2007 ) '  a feature - length compilation of the same nature footage  on the big screen , I jumped at the chance . The theatre was basically empty ; just one other patron sat in the row ahead of me , and it was as though I had , not only the big screen to myself , but , indeed , the entire planet Earth . For 90 minutes , I was lowered into the beauty and perils of the isolated wilderness , amongst some of the most beautiful living creatures ever captured on film . Awesome in its scope , and yet painfully intimate at times , ' Earth ' is a heartfelt plea from the filmmakers to recognise the delicate balance of life on our planet , and how the intrusion of humans has placed countless glorious animal and plant species on the brink of extinction . Though the film , directed by Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield , obviously argues for the conservation of the wilderness , it refrains from beating us over the head with propaganda , and the puzzle that is politics is ignored altogether ; indeed , there is not a human in sight . Instead , we are simply taken on a breathtaking journey into the majesty of the natural world , to experience the resilience , and also the fragility , of life on Earth . I hear that the original mini - series , which ran for eleven episodes , delves a lot deeper into the scientific background of world ecosystems , but I think that , here , the filmmakers made a wise decision to replace information with emotional impact : I ca n't remember the last time that I felt so inspired , and yet utterly heartbroken at the same time . By establishing an emotional link between the audience and a select few individual animals , anthropomorphising them to an extent , we are suddenly able to appreciate the " human side " of each species , and their hopeless plight for survival becomes less a statistic and more an unacceptable tragedy . ' Earth ' is basically comprised of a selection of dramatic episodes , whether it be the struggles of a female polar bear to lead her young cubs to the Arctic ice , or the tramp of an elephant herd towards the life - saving seasonal floodwaters of the Okavango Delta . The documentary demonstrates the delicate balance between life and death , most heartbreakingly exhibited in the desperate ballet of predator - prey interactions . Though occasionally , perhaps to cater towards a younger audience , the footage cuts itself short at the crucial moment , I regularly shed at tear at the inevitability of death in nature , and the raw instinct that fuels these animals ' final , hopeless efforts at survival . There 's even a haunting beauty to be found in the hunt , both in the slow - motion footage of a cheetah bringing down its prey { the result of a single fateful misstep } , or the majestic mid - air leap of a Great White Shark as it engulfs a hapless sea lion . It is this frail balance that has been fatally disrupted by the selfishness of our own species . Aside from these main stories , we are also treated to brief snippets of wildlife from around the world , including the birds of paradise of Papua New Guinea , and the autumn migration of the demoiselle cranes . Of course , entire films might have been dedicated to these species alone , and an inevitable consequence of having to sift through so much footage is that some interesting ecosystems are glossed over far took quickly . By choosing to focus most closely on the polar bear , elephant and humpback whale  tracing their lifestyles , via some astonishing high - definition time - lapse photography , throughout a calender year  the filmmakers were able to avoid any structural problems that might arise from having so much to show , and only 90 minutes to show it . Consequently , ' Earth ' left me thirsting for more , and , fortunately , I now have approximately eleven hours more , as soon as I can track down a copy of the DVD box - set for " Planet Earth . " Uplifting and tear - jerking , awe - inspiring and heartrending , ' Earth ' is a truly magnificent documentary experience , and it might just be my favourite film of 2007 .
neg	Yes , Marie Dresler drinks prune juice that she thinks is poison and she exits running . Dresler is good . Never my cup of tea but she is a solid performer who surely holds the screen . I watched this for Polly Moran , whom I 've seen elsewhere . Here , Moran is OK -- just OK -- as Dressler 's shrewish friend / foe . Too bad she has sunk into nearly total oblivion . The plot is good hearted . Bad guys try to rob the townspeople . Dressler triumphs and all ends well . I do wonder about the central plot mechanism : bonds . This came out during the Depression so maybe everyone was familiar with bonds and what they can do if used well and if used wrongly . I , however , not of that era , am vaguely familiar with them . They 're like stocks only different , right ? It seems odd to build a story about The Little Man around a somewhat sophisticated monetary entity .
pos	The only reason I wanted to see this was because of Orlando Bloom . Simply put , the movie was spectacularly average . It 's not bad , but it 's really not very good . The editing is good ; the film is well - paced . The direction is competent and assured . The story is plodding . The film is averagely acted by Ledger , Bloom , and the normally great Watts and Rush . The accents are impenetrable if you 're from the US so just sit back and enjoy the scenery ( or as I like to call it , Orlando Bloom ) . By the end of the film , I was neither bored nor moved . Some people have asked what happened to Ned Kelly at the end of the movie . I have to say , I so did not care by that point . Really , the only reason I can recommend this is that Orlando Bloom kind of , sort of shows some hints of range ( although the oft - present " I 'm pretty and confused " look is prominent ) , so fangirls may find it worth the matinee price . Other than that , just do n't see it . It 's neither good enough nor bad enough to be entertaining .
neg	What a fantastic premise : A movie about the Berlin Airlift . It should have it all . Tragedy . Suspense . Comradeship . Rivals . Berliner Frauleins and tough US pilots . love and Tears . What we 've got , is a film with none of the above . Heino Ferch tries to impersonate John Wayne or so , but he fails miserably . He acts so wooden , that at any given moment he should crack . He tries to play the tough guy , instead of being a tough guy ! Why would Bettina Zimmermann 's character fall in love with him ? Cause they were throwing stones in a lake ? Cause he brings her coal bricks ? The SFX are very , very well done . Too much though . The hundreds or so planes over Berlin , look like an attack - fighter - formation - squadron rather than an organised airlift  as it actually was . Interestingly enough , the White House , the Kremlin , and General Lucius D. Clays office seem all to be one and the same dark and dusty set . Notice the same drapes , hanging deep down the windows , as if a protective shield against nuclear fallout . Why is almost every scene INSIDE dark and dusty ? By the way , GENERAL LUCIUS D. CLAY , comes across as a small time , insecure , looser General , who doest trust in his own noble idea the airlift . He was very much the opposite . So you combine all those individual blunders and the result is a film with that builds toward no passion , no suspense and no historic accuracy . Sad , it started out so promising
pos	I first saw this film in 1980 in the midday movie spot . After many subsequent viewings ( and purchase of the video ) it still makes me laugh out loud . Yes , it 's a relic of another age - a domestic comedy set in affluent middle class America - but well executed is well executed . But it 's also a document of its age - a celebration of post - war optimism , the baby boom and the nascent consumer age . This film is no " guilty " pleasure . Three wonderful sophisticated leads actors - urbane Melvyn Douglas ; bemused Cary Grant ; daffily determined Myrna Loy - complement each other and a memorable team of characters . My favourite scenes - " It means we got ta blast " and " Miss Stellwaggen " and " This little piggy " . Love it .
neg	i was lucky enough to see A Chorus Line when it came to my city .. i was younger then .. but it was an Excellent play .. so would someone please tell me why in heavens name did they have to make a movie out of it .. and why Michael Douglas ? ? ? He did nt suit the role .. this movie really sucked BIG time ! ! ! my advise is NOT to rent this movie .. save your money for something better like " Cats " ....
pos	A great gangster film . Sam Mendes has directed this beautiful movie showing another father - son camaraderie . Brilliant star - cast leading with Tom Hanks(Michael Sullivan ) has done a terrific job . Great acting by him again . He is an acting legend . Great acting too from Paul Newman , Jude Law and Daniel Craig . Casting is just too good . The plot is quite good . You will enjoy the movie . A great portrayal of the gangster of the 1930's . Set in the 1930's , this will surely stand out as the zenith of all gangster movies of that era . Soundtrack is pretty good an apt to the movie . A great flick in totality showing what a father does to protect his son . Way underrated for my liking . Deserved a fully deserved 10 .
neg	Stupid , mindless drivel about a jet assembled within hours by mechanics who have never worked on airplanes ( piloted by Burgess Meredith ) chasing a Porsche race car which runs on decades - old gasoline sludge , driven by Lee Majors , with Chris Makepeace as the runaway techno - wiz who can McGyver spare parts into a radio receiver which can pick up all frequencies simultaneously , and who somehow learned how to acquire and use chemicals to make high explosives in a perfectly peaceful society . As moronic as it sounds . Terrible waste of Burgess Meredith , but Chris Makepeace may at least be forgiven on the grounds that this was only his second film .
pos	GONE IN 60 SECONDS / ( 2000 ) * * * ( out of four )
neg	This movie is terrible . TERRIBLE . One of the worst movies ever . I can not even imagine Gigli being worse that this . Previews made us say " NO " , but then looking for something amid the dreck out there right now , we decided to go ahead and give it a shot . STUPID US . Affleck is NOT an actor . He 's an image and can look good with explosions , but not even the kind Bruce Willis got in " Die Hard " . If he stripped his shirt and ran around fighting bad guys , it would be a comedy . The best part was Catherine O'Hara -- she 's always good . Gandolfini flops again ( if it were n't for The Sopranos , he 'd be washed up ) like he did in " The Mexican " . Affleck hogs every scene and as others have said -- no character has any motivation whatsoever for their actions .   AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS .
pos	I want Céline and Jessie go further in their relationship , I want to tell them that they were made for each other , that in a lot of moment in the film we want they to die for each other . Their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never reached . This is about love but not stupid things like in " notting hills " or those kind of movie . This is life and i did believe in them , i did believe they were falling ... This was so clever and touching . I have just finished to view it a minute ago and i m still there ... I want to go to Vienna . I want to see them as soon as possible again . I have to say i was now becoming misanthropist and felt like if love was just a fake , a concept , but with this movie i realized that maybe somewhere , somehow and some when , something could really happen . I 'm french and did n't know very well July Delpy despite Kieslowski " three colors : white " ... Now i have to see her other works because she looks like an angel and got a perfect acting . i saw " before sunset " ( the sequel in Paris ) a few days before i saw " before sunrise " and their is no matter . They are both masterpieces . proof that you do n't need to impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings . I 'm sorry for my English which i m trying to best . Franck in France
neg	Lorenzo Lamas stars as some type of CIA agent , who captures some exotic beauty named Alexa , kidnaps her daughter and forces her to fight her former employers . O.J Simpson is also on board to provide a dash of acting credibility for the not so talented ensemble . I must admit i 'm not a fan of Lorenzo Lamas , or his movies . He stinks . However when compared to O.J Simpson and Lamas ' comatose wife Kinmont , Lamas seems like ah , Jean - Claude Van Damme . I only saw CIA because of the renewed interest around the O.J Simpson trial , you see because if your parents had cable and the extra channels , you could n't escape this movie . in 1994 you could go to an Amish community and some moron would have this playing in their portable TV . The movie itself is a collection of lame action sequences and would be intrigue although the shock value of O.J Simpson jumping after fireballs and exchanging would be one liners do provide some unintentional humor . Also where was Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant to make this a complete camp classic ?   * out of 4-(Bad )
pos	Princess Tam Tam is without the trappings of racism , in the way we think of racism in the United States , but there are more subtle ( to the American viewer ) assertions about ethnic identity during the time . Pay attention to Alwina 's ( Baker ) placement within shots , how she is addressed by the other characters , the settings around her that all depict her as a " savage " African , and ask yourself if Alwina has any shred of agency throughout the film . I do n't want to ruin anything but at the end pay very careful attention , the dichotomy between " Eastern " and " Western " culture is to say the least offensive , such diction is thankfully disavowed these days . The French have a checkered past as an imperial force throughout the areas depicted ( see Chris Marker 's Les Statues Meurent Aussi- 1953 ) , and pay attention to the places the European travelers visit while they are in Africa , and what does that reflect about their attitudes towards the " other " . I give this film a 7 because I am a sucker for Baker , much of what she did in her professional career , like Princes Tam Tam , that is regressive is certainly overshadowed by her efforts towards integration , her work as a freaking spy ( I am gushing , sorry . ) However the film for me is captivating because of her performance , besides that it is a telling relic of bygone mentalities .
neg	Anyone who saw the original 1970 movie knows how an excellent cast , script , and director can put together a comedy masterpiece . By the same token , it 's easy to see how the opposite of that can create another insipid Hollywood bore - a - thon ! This movie was pathetic ! Had it not been for John Cleese ( a comic genius ) , I would have walked out about 15 minutes into this dreadful waste of celluloid . Neil Simon would n't write another screenplay for this version ( he said that he could n't improve on the first ) , and I 'm surprised that after this cinematic fiasco he would n't sue for defamation of humor ! Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis did such a wonderful job in the original , what were the producers thinking about when they cast this one ? How could the director and editor look at these scenes and think any of them were funny ? I do n't know , but one thing I do know --- it 's no surprise why foreign and independent movies are becoming more and more popular .......
pos	Go way back to page ten of this review section , and work your way back up . Go ahead ; I 'll wait . Done ? Well , then you 've probably noticed the same trend that I have . You could nitpick all day long about the lame jokes , dated timing and obviously derivative plot points and shtick in ' Bogus ' , but this movie seems to be one of those ' hate me now , love me later " flicks . Bill and Ted 's biggest problem was that the original appealed to those 80 's kids who followed the tends and considered themselves on the cutting edge of fashion . That worked fine for the original , but obviously bombed in 1991 , when no self - unrespecting slacker would be caught dead wearing anything but flannel or admitting he liked anything about the 80 's . As Ted would put it : " Dude , this is a totally deep hole . Wanna play 20 questions ? "   They say nostalgia goes in 20 year cycles , and that certainly seems to be the case here . Here in 2010 , those of use who grew up with Cindi Lauper and Megadeth are beginning to look back to appreciate some of those pivotal films that ( like it or not ) made us who we are . If you 're one of those who look at ' Bogus ' as if it were an outdated ( " Fa gs ! " ) ripoff , then you 're missing the point and probably spent six years growing facial hair , wearing flannel and looking like you just crawled out of bed . In self - referencing its own origins ( the Star Trek episode " and and time traveling with a phone booth ) , B&T makes no attempt to hide its creators ' love for homage . Quentin Tarantino , anyone ? I 'm not saying ' Bogus ' is ' True Love , ' but I do think it needs to be appreciated for what it is : a fun snap - shot of our society at a time before child psychology , Ritalin , anti - smoking ads , terrorist paranoia and the proliferation of media fear - mongering .   So , for all of you B&T haters out there ... turn off your Screaming Trees CD , get that hair out of your face , go to the beach and lighten up . Narcissistic depression and intellectual ennui are SO corporate .
neg	I caught this stink bomb of a movie recently on a cable channel , and was reminded of how terrible I thought it was in 1980 when first released . Many reviewers out there are n't old enough to remember the enormous hype that surrounded this movie and the struggle between Stanley Kubrick and Steven King . The enormously popular novel had legions of fans eager to see a supposed " master " director put this multi - layered supernatural story on the screen . " Salem 's Lot " had already been ruined in the late 1970s as a TV mini - series , directed by Tobe Hooper ( he of " Texas Chainsaw Massacre " fame ) and was badly handled , turning the major villain of the book into a " Chiller Theatre " vampire with no real menace at all thus destroying the entire premise . Fans hoped that a director of Kubrick 's stature would succeed where Hooper had failed . It did n't happen . Sure , this movie looks great and has a terrific opening sequence but after those few accomplishments , it 's all downhill . Jack Nicholson can not be anything but Jack Nicholson . He 's always crazy and did n't bring anything to his role here . I do n't care that many reviewers here think he 's all that in this clinker , the " Here 's Johnny ! " bit notwithstanding ... he 's just awful in this movie . So is everyone else , for that matter . Scatman Crothers ' character , Dick Halloran , was essential to the plot of the book , yet Kubrick kills him off in one of the lamest " shock " sequences ever put on film . I remember the audience in the theater I saw this at booing repeatedly during the last 45 minutes of this wretched flick , those that stayed that is ... many left . King 's books really never translate well to film since so much of the narratives occur internally to his characters , and often metaphysically . Kubrick jettisoned the tension between the living and the dead in favor of style here and the resulting mess ends so far from the original material that we ultimately do n't really care what happens to whom . This movie still stinks and why so many think it 's a horror masterpiece is beyond me .
pos	This is a lot of silliness about a woman from London who marries a tea planter from Ceylon whom she barely knows . It 's full of cliches , and the Liz Taylor character is not believable . It has a marvelous set , some exotic location footage . It shows Taylor at the height of her beauty . She looks stunning .
neg	It took 9 years to complete this film . I would think that within those 9 years someone would have said , hey , this film is terrible . I 've seen better acting in porn movies . The story is tired and played . Abused child turns into serial killer . How about something new for a change . How about abused child turns into a florist ? At least that would have been a new twist . Why is it that everyone with a camera and a movie idea ( especially unoriginal movie ideas ) thinks that they can be a director ? I do admire the fact that they stuck with this film for 9 years to get it completed . That shows tenacity and spirit . With this kind of drive hopefully next time they can focus it on a better script . If you want to see a failed experiment in indie film making from a writer / director from Michigan see Hatred of A Minute . If you want a good movie from a Michigan writer / director stick with Evil Dead .
pos	The penultimate collaboration between director Anthony Mann and star James Stewart ( excluding the few days Mann worked on Night Passage before parting company with the star under less than amicable circumstances ) , The Far Country belies its mainstream look to offer another portrait of an embittered man dragged unwillingly to his own redemption , fighting it every step of the way . This time he 's a cattle driver whose response to labour problems - challenging troublesome cowhands to a gunfight at the end of the trail - results in his cattle being confiscated by John McIntire 's larcenous judge of the Roy Bean school of law and order . Stealing them back and taking them across the Canadian border , he soon finds himself unwillingly drawn into the growing conflict between prospectors and the judge as he cheats or kills them out of their claims ... While it 's no great surprise which way Stewart turns at the end , he 's a surprisingly callous critter along the way , even using his desire to just be left alone to excuse not warning a group of prospectors of an impending avalanche when he has the chance because it 's not his problem . For most of the film there 's really only a hair 's breadth between him and McIntire , something the judge recognises immediately , revelling in the company of a kindred spirit even as he 's genially planning to lynch him . In many ways the townspeople who put their faith in him probably recognise it too - despite their appeals to his dead - and - buried better nature , there 's an unspoken acknowledgement that the only person who can stand up to the judge is someone almost as bad as he is . As usual with Mann there 's an exceptional use of high country locations , though for once the final showdown takes place on level ground , and the film is almost perfectly cast with strong support from Walter Brennan , Harry Morgan and Ruth Roman ( though Corinne Calvert 's young romantic interest veers to the irritating ) . Sadly the great cinematography of the Canadian Rockies is done few favours by a distinctly average DVD transfer , with only the theatrical trailer as an extra .
neg	I just finished watching this movie and I found it was basically just not funny at all . I 'm an RPG Gamer ( computer type , none of the DnD tabletop stuff ) but I found none of the jokes in this funny at all . Some of the scenes seemed to drag out a lot ( tilt and zoom could 've been cut down to 5seconds rather than over a minute ) and it feels as though the director was just trying to fill in time . I think I laughed a total of 2 - 3 times in the entire movie . The acting itself was n't all that bad , around the standard that a B Grade movie should have . I 'd suggest not bothering with this movie unless you 're a huge DnD fan and even then it would probably be best to steer clear of it .
pos	Dick Tracy is easily the best comic book based movie made to date . The movie has the same feel as the comic book , staying true to the color scheme . The Batman series has climbed , fallen , climbed and fallen again . Dick Tracy has true staying power as something that both adults and children can enjoy . The good guys triumph over evil , without blood and gore to get the point across . Al Pacino does a wonderful job of his own adaptation of Big Boy Caprice and Madonna is memorable as Breathless . But the best job by far is Warren Beatty who just epitomizes Dick Tracy just as he did with Clyde Barrows . I ca n't wait until it comes out on DVD on April 2 , 2002 , my tape is wearing thin .
neg	I am a big fan of Arnold Vosloo . Finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie , not just a bit part , made me happy . Unfortunately I took film appreciation in college and the only thing I can say that I did n't like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or lookie loos . I have to say that the acting leaves something to be desired , but Arnold is an excellent actor , I have to chalk it up to lousy direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desired . I love Arnold Vosloo , and he made the film viewable . Otherwise , I would have written it off as another lousy film . I found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary , but the actors that got away at the end were pretty good . But the sound effects of the shoot - out were pretty bad . There are some glitches in the film ( continuity ) but they are overlookable considering the low - caliber of the film . All in all I enjoyed the film , because Arnold Vosloo was in it . Jackie
pos	Sure Star Wars ( a movie I have seen at least fifty times ) beats all the others in special effects , but this film has every thing else ! It has horror(non - graphical ) , romance , robots , witty repartee , intelligence , ( surprisingly good ) special effects , and drama . I saw this film a couple of years ago in a revival with a newly struck print , and I was amazed at how well it held up today . I thought the old 40 's style electronics would look hokey , but they somehow looked futuristic and moderne . Ann Francis in here ( mostly ) short skirts and bare feet with a girlish innocence that is hard to beat still gets a rise out of me . The Krell monster appearing in the ray beams still scares the bejebees out of me . Of course we all know that the " Great Bird of the Galaxy " probably modeled much of " Star Trek " from this movie . No one has yet to beat Robby , the Robot , in terms of personality ( sorry , R2D2 and C3PO ) . This movie , overall , is the standard that all other Science Fiction films will have to measure up to ! Honorable mention for the haunting electronic score which kept us all on pins and needles .
neg	Oh , well , this movie starts off well . It 's kinda funny and seems like it could be a fun movie . Then it becomes a bit serious and goes off the rails . It sort of wants to be ' Boogie Nights ' but it ca n't achieve it . If only it stayed with the tone of the first quarter of the film ...
pos	This movie scared heck out of me when I was just a kid . It 's no " Citizen Kane " but it has its moments . The arm ripping scene is good . The plot is good even if characters are n't - could have something to do with the acting . Put some top name people in the roles and then see what you get . This was one of those shoot , edit ( what little there was ) and distribute in a couple of months type of movies . This is classic low budget sci - fi and deserves it just due . I rated it a 9 based other films of this genre and age .
neg	Roy Rogers stars as Jesse James and his look - alike , gambler man Clint Burns . George " Gabby " Hayes is Mr. Rogers 's ex - pal , Sheriff Gabby . Gale Storm ( Jane Fillmore ) and Sally Payne ( Polly Morgan ) are a noteworthy team , as two reporters on the lookout for stories about the elusive outlaw hero . Of course , mistaken identity / impersonation is a plot development , since Rogers essays a " dual role " . Rogers is charming , as usual ; but , there is nothing really elevating this his performance above the ordinary - any potential to deliver a memorable Jekyll / Hyde performance is done in by poor material . The better pair to watch are Ms. Storm and Ms. Paye as the St. Louis Journal reporters - they are the film 's highlight . The songs are fine , though badly synched .   * * * Jesse James at Bay ( 1941 ) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers , George ' Gabby ' Hayes , Gale Storm
pos	This was a movie that I had heard about all my life growing up , but had never seen it until a few years ago . It 's reputation truly proceeded it . I knew of Michael Myers , had seen the mask , saw commercials for all of the crummy sequels that followed . But I was growing up during the decade where Jason and Freddy had a deadly grip on the horror game , and never thought much of the Halloween franchise . Boy , how I was being cheated with cheap knock offs . Halloween is a genuinely terrifying movie . Now , by today 's standards , it is n't as graphic and visceral , but this film delivers on all the other levels most horror movies fail to achieve today . The atmosphere that John Carpenter creates is so creepy , and the fact that it is set in a quaint , mid - west town is a testament to his ability . The lighting effects are down right horrifying , with " The Shape " seemingly appearing and disappearing into the shadows at will . The simple yet brutally effective music score only adds to the suspense . The performances by all the players are well done , with specific nods to Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance . Ms. Curtis is such a good Laurie Strode because she is so likable and vulnerable . It is all the more frightening when she is being stalked by Michael Myers because the director and viewer have invested so much into her , we want her to survive and get away . Donald Pleasance plays Dr. Loomis like a man on a mission , and it works well . He adds a sense of urgency to the predicament the town finds itself in because he knows what evil stalks their streets . Overall , not only is Halloween a great horror movie , but also a great film . It works on many levels and draws the audience in and never lets up . This should be standard viewing for anyone wanting to experience a truly scary movie . And for an even more frightful time , try watching it alone with the lights off . Do n't be surprised if you think you see " The Shape " lurking around in the shadows !
neg	This agonizing comedy - drama got surprisingly sterling reviews upon its release in 1979 . I remember opening the movie - section of the L.A. Times and looking at a 2-page advertisement for " Chapter Two " filled with glowing captions like : " Better than ' The Goodbye Girl ' ! " and " Neil Simon does it again ! " What does Neil Simon do ? He takes an autobiographical situation ( remarrying too soon after the death of a beloved spouse ) and makes it rusty , unpleasant and -- worst of all -- unfunny . James Caan plays Neil -- er .. that is , George -- a writer who ca n't seem to get back into life after losing his wife ; enter spirited Marsha Mason ( real - life Mrs. Simon ... soon to be ex - Mrs . Simon ) who attempts to love George despite his moods and general melancholy . Mason is very appealing here and might 've saved the day were it not for Caan 's indifference ( not to mention a sub - plot concerning painfully - thin , blonde Valerie Harper which brings the proceedings to a screeching halt ) . I liked Mason 's outburst at the end ( " I am wonderful ! I am NUTS about me ! " ) , but I saw no happy ending for these two people ... and time proved me right . * * from * * * *
pos	It was on at 7:30am , too close to school to see very often . The animation & computer graphics were spectacular for the time . The idea of cowboys & ordinary people casually throwing around space vehicles & robots was amazing . Maybe it inspired Treasure Planet . Unfortunately , it 's really boring in the DVD format . The shows are all basically identical . When viewing non - sequential episodes on a DVD , you 're stoned by disk # 3 . By today 's standards , the animation is spotty . We do n't notice the computer graphics anymore and focus on how corny the characters are instead . The bright spots are the heroine characters . They were a lot more believable , took themselves more seriously than modern heroines , and were n't corny . They actually saved men .
neg	Poorly - made " blaxploitation " crime - drama aimed squarely at the black urban market of the early 1970s . Pam Grier stars in the title role , that of a nurse who becomes a one - woman vigilante after drug - dealing thugs make Coffy 's little sister a junkie . Violent nonsense plods along doggedly , with canned energy and excitement ; only Grier 's flaring temper gives the narrative a jolt ( she 's not much of an actress here , but she connects with the audience in a primal way ) . Not much different from what Charles Bronson was doing at this time , the film was marketed and advertised as crass exploitation yet still managed to find a sizable inner - city audience . Today however , it 's merely a footnote in ' 70s film history , and lacks the wide - range appeal of other movies in this genre . * 1/2 from * * * *
pos	This is on my top list of all - time favourite films ! It is a fantastic and insightful film . It was Historically interesting and great to watch ! I thought the acting from Emily Blunt was fantastic and Rupert Friend was a fantastic Albert , the best actor was chosen for Albert . The costumes were gorgeous and the settings and scenes such as the opera house , were amazing and detailed . I just loved it , all of it ! I loved the childhood scenes were she 's getting ' bullied ' by John Conroy . And where her mother says she has to walk stairs with an adult . One again the writers have done it ! They produced this fantastic script !   It thoroughly deserves the awards they got . ( Oscar and BAFTA wining Sandy Powell , for costume design . A BAFTA for best make - up and hair , an Oscar in Best Achievement in Art Direction , Best Achievement in Costume Design , Best Achievement in Makeup . Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards for Best costume design , also nominated for best actress Emily Blunt . CDG for Excellence in Costume Design for Film - Period . Hampton 's International Film Awards for an Audience Award for Best Narrative Film . PFCS for Best Costume design . Sudbury Cinefest , does n't say what for . VFCC for Best Actress , Emily Blunt . ) Overall 10 wins and 11 nominations ! That pretty good ! http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0962736/awards Have a look yourself , its really interesting ! Personally Rupert Friend should have got an award .
neg	The second attempt by a New York intellectual in less than 10 years to make a " Swedish " film - the first being Susan Sontag 's " Brother Carl " ( which was made in Sweden , with Swedish actors , no less ! ) The results ? Oscar Wilde said it best , in reference to Dickens ' " The Old Curiosity Shop " : " One would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of Little Nell . " Pretty much the same thing here . " Interiors " is chock full of solemnly intoned howlers . ( " I 'm afraid of my anger . " Looking into the middle distance : " I do n't like who I 'm becoming . " ) The directorial quotations ( to use a polite term ) from Bergman are close to parody . The incredibly self - involved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are , to the point of strangulation . ( " I read a poem of yours the other day . It was in - I do n't know - The New Yorker . " " Oh . That was an old poem . I reworked it . " ) Far from not caring about these people , however , I found them quite hilarious . Much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from Allen 's earlier films - only he 's directed his actors to play the lines straight . Having not cast himself in the movie , he has poor Mary Beth Hurt copy all of his thespian tics , intonations , and neurotic habits , turning her into an embarrassing surrogate ( much like Kenneth Branagh in " Celebrity " ) . The basic plot - dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother - seems to be lifted more or less from Bergman 's " Winter Light , " the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst . It all comes through in the shopworn visual / aural tricks : the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper , the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach . etc , etc . Allen 's later " serious " films are less embarrassing , but also far less entertaining . I 'll take " Interiors . " Woody 's rarely made a funnier movie .
pos	It 's not a big film . The acting is not amazing ( some sub charterers are even played badly ) , The film is not beautiful in any sense . Nothing really inventive or new . If you like big films , this one is not for you . yet it has a big - REALLY BIG plus on the story . Larry 's story works , because we know this story from our own lives . The girl we did n't ask to a date , the test we 've failed , the friend we let down , are all in our history . This movie works , because it touch it , It 's a great story because it 's a small one . It 's the life we all have , with regrets we all have , and yet the message hits : every life we could have lived would have had their downside . The first time I watched it , I was 15 . It was shown in a party at my school . 16 years later , I keep reflecting on it every once in a while , and every time I see it , it puts a smile on my face . Watch it . It will do you good . You 'll be happier with what you have .
neg	I must say that I am fairly disappointed by this " horror " movie . I did not get scared even once while watching it . It also is not very suspenseful either .... I was able to guess the ending half way through the movie ... So .. what 's left ? " The Ring " is a trully scary movie ... I wish other movies would stop copying from it ( e.g. the trade - mark : long hair ) . Please give me some originality . Will not recommend this movie .
pos	This is one of the best movies I have ever seen . I feel greatly touched by the theme the movie intends to convey . One sentence that keeps coming up on my mind is that " history repeats itself " . Life is what it is shown in the movie : when people are young , they seem not to understand their parents , their own spouses ; people have every excuse for not sharing the dearest time with their children until too late ; people always have to work hard to support the whole family but are just liable to neglect the subtle feeling of their partners ; people always change their perspectives at different stages of their lives ; people can always be forgiven if their heart is full of love for their beloved ; nothing is more important than the blood relation people share in this world , and one is never too late to talk with their folks about what they feel at the bottom of their heart so as to achieve a better understanding between themselves , so that when life has to end some day , people should not feel sorry or regretful since they have kept their words and there is always hope ---a new life . The actors and actresses are fantastic . They have understood the director 's intention perfectly . The movie 's charm lies in , to me , the effect of bringing a skillful and splendid fusion of cheers and tears to the audience .
neg	I 'm a horror / gore movie freak and this flick was so bad , I felt embarrassed for not only the " actors " , but also the director and the poor sap of a producer who actually put his money up for this schlock . From the title , you 'd expect some great carnage , somewhat of a storyline and at LEAST some direction or dialog . Instead , you get what looks like a slightly more violent and sexual Three Stooges episode . At least I laugh at the Three Stooges . While watching this crap , I turned another TV on and started watching Howard Stern until something interesting happened . Needless to say , I kept watching Stern . Watching this " film " I realize that I could produce a film with three monkeys , 2 DV cameras , $ 50 dollars in loose change and a broken PC . This film is my inspiration to get into no - budget film making . Watch this movie if you dare , but be warned ... there is a lot of nothing in here but a whole lot of talking and very little action . This makes " KaZaam " look like a Meryl Streep film . I 'm sure Germany did n't ban it due to sex or violence . Other countries need to take heed .
pos	Surprisingly good early effort from Alfred Hitchcock . One of the only original screenplays written by Hitchcock himself , this film shows remarkable story structure . It kicks off with a rousing boxing match in which carnival champ " One Round " Jack loses to a challenger from the audience who happens to be a professional prizefighter . The movie then slows down to develop the characters and introduce a love triangle between Jack , his girl and the professional boxer . The rest of the film is a dramatic buildup to the rematch between the two men , this time for the heavyweight crown . Even in this early film , Hitchcock shows his talent for meaningful cinematography and prop placement . An armband bought for the girl by the boxer continues to pop up throughout the movie as a symbol of her unfaithfulness . The only big detractor of this film is that the art of filming a boxing match had not yet been perfected in 1927 . The final match , as a result , ends up being somewhat anticlimactic . The story , though , is what carries this film through .
neg	my wife is a fanatic as regards this show . That being the case I bought her seasons one through three and season four is on order . I personally think the show is one big farce the cast is equally bad . Alyssa Milano should have stuck to the other trash movies she made such as Poison Ivy , Embrace of the Vampire to name a few , the other female supporting cast members are equally inept in their portrayals . I 've seen better special effects in the old Republic Pictures serials I saw as a child . I can understand why the male leads remained on the show for such short periods of time even though I do n't know if it was their own choosing or not . Please . please do n't renew for another season as enough is enough , Bob
pos	There 's so many things to fall for in Aro Tolbukhin . En la mente del asesino ( Inside the killer 's mind ) , that it 's very hard to talk about it without giving any kind of warning . Let 's just say that this movie is like an exercise in cinema but really , really great done . It´s made with super 8 , black and white shots , 35 milimeters , color , interviews , flashbacks . Aro Tolbukhin it´s like a movie made a documental or viceversa , which most peculiar aspect relays on the doubt that leaves you wondering , did he really ever existed ? The movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in Guatemala , worked in a religious mission and then killed some people . An act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced . The movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death . Nowadays , some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character . The one we are witness of -the movie . For the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside Aro´s mind , mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done . Nevertheless , the important thing is that the filmmakers never gives us a sided point of view ; they left the judging for all of us and even as we may understand his actions , we clearly never justify them . So , the first half is based upon recollecting information ; later things turn into Aro 's childhood , giving the movie such an incredible new force ( even tough never got weak or boring ) . I do n't mean -and do n't want- to spoil anything ; so the only thing left to say is that if by any chance you get this movie near you , believe me , the trip to see it is more than worthy .
neg	I was very disappointed by this film for a few reasons . For the first half hour it 's actually pretty decent . Although the acting is n't any better then that which you would find in a rap video , its kinda funny and the production value does n't seem half bad . In fact I almost thought this would be almost as good as Perico Ripiao ( another recent Dominican film ) which turned out to be MUCH MUCH better than I expected . The plot for the movie revolves around not just cheating husbands but how women are viewed and treated in Dominican society as a whole , which makes for a good premise especially in The Dominican Republic . Unfortunately I do n't think the makers of this film relies that a good movie is all about how you treat your subject matter , and they f'ing butchered the veal cutlet they had before them . About 30 minutes into the movie the roles of men and women are reversed after the main characters wife puts a kind of spell on him as a result of his cheating habits . Not only does this transition happen via what look to be cutting edge , space age , CGI effects dating to what I 'm guessing would be the 70 's , but the whole plot just goes down the drain . The rest of the movie is nothing but cheesy predictable situations , and clever one liners . To top it all off ( and I guess I should warn you now * * SPOILER ALERT * * ) it all turns out to be a dream . Oh my who did n't see that coming ? Oh man I almost forgot the most ridiculous thing about the movie . Well after about an hour into it I start thinking "  hmmmm something just does n't seem right about the sound track but what can it be ? ? "  and then it hits me HALF OF THE MUSIC IN THE MOVIE WAS TAKEN FROM A VIDEO GAME CALLED KING OF FIGHTER 95 . When oh when DR will you give us a film we can call a work of art ? ! ? ! Perhaps a comedy to match France 's Amelie , or an action flick to match Thailand 's Ong - Bak , an animation as Akira was to Japan , a witty crime thriller as Layer Cake was to England , or a socio - awakening journey as Waking Life had here in the states . ... i would give it a 1 but i 've seen much worse come out of DR , search Los Jodedores and you 'll know what I 'm talking about .
pos	This is the first Jean Renoir Silent film I have watched and perhaps rightly so since it is generally regarded to be his best , besides being also his first major work . Overall , it is indeed a very assured and technically accomplished film which belies the fact that it was only Renoir ’s sophomore effort . For fans of the director , it is full of interesting hints at future Renoir movies especially THE DIARY OF A CHAMBERMAID ( 1946 ) and THE GOLDEN COACH ( 1952 ) – in its depiction of a lower class femme fatale madly desired by various aristocrats who disgrace themselves for her – but also THE RULES OF THE GAME ( 1939 ) – showing as it does in one sequence how the rowdy servants behave when their masters ' backs are turned away from them – and FRENCH CANCAN ( 1955 ) – Nana is seen having a go at the scandalous dance at one point . Personally , I would say that the film makes for a respectable companion piece to G.W. Pabst ’s PANDORA ’S BOX ( 1928 ) , Josef von Sternberg ’s THE BLUE ANGEL ( 1930 ) and Max Ophuls’ LOLA MONTES ( 1955 ) in its vivid recreation of the sordid life of a courtesan . Having said all that , the film was a resounding critical and commercial failure at the time of its release – a “ mad undertaking ” as Renoir himself later referred to it in his memoirs which , not only personally cost him a fortune ( he eventually eased the resulting financial burden by selling off some of his late father ’s paintings ) , but almost made him give up the cinema for good ! Stylistically , NANA is quite different from Renoir ’s sound work and owes a particular debt to Erich von Stroheim ’s FOOLISH WIVES ( 1922 ) , a film Renoir greatly admired – and , on a personal note , one which I really ought to revisit presto ( having owned the Kino DVD of it and the other von Stroheims for 4 years now ) . Anyway , NANA is certainly not without its flaws : a deliberate pace makes itself felt during the overly generous 130 minute running time with some sequences ( the horse race around the mid - point in particular ) going on too long . The overly mannered acting style on display is also hard to take at times – particularly that of Catherine Hessling ’s Nana and Raymond Guerin - Catelain ’s Georges Hugon ( one of her various suitors) … although , technically , they are being their characters i.e. a bad actress ( who takes to the courtesan lifestyle when she is booed off the stage ) and an immature weakling , respectively . However , like Anna Magnani in THE GOLDEN COACH , Hessling ( Renoir ’s wife at the time , by the way ) is just not attractive enough to be very convincing as “ the epitome of elegance ” ( as another admirer describes her at one stage ) who is able to enslave every man she meets . Other notables in the cast are “ Dr. Caligari ” himself , Werner Krauss ( as Nana ’s most fervent devotee , Count Muffat ) , Jean Angelo ( as an initially skeptical but eventually tragic suitor of Nana ’s ) and future distinguished film director Claude Autant - Lara ( billed as Claude Moore and also serving as art director here ) as Muffat ’s close friend but who is secretly enamored with the latter ’s neglected wife !   The print I watched – via Lionsgate ’s “ Jean Renoir 3-Disc Collector ’s Edition ” – is , for the most part , a lovingly restored and beautifully - tinted one which had been previously available only on French DVD . Being based on a classic of French literature ( by Emile Zola , no less ) , it can not help but having been brought to the screen several times and the two most notable film versions are Dorothy Arzner ’s in 1934 ( with Anna Sten and Lionel Atwill and which I own on VHS ) and Christian - Jaque ’s in 1955 ( with Martine Carol and Charles Boyer , which I am not familiar with ) .
neg	LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman . Dylan McDermott . Kevin Spacey . John Heard . Cary Elwes . Roslyn Sanchez . Justin Timberlake -- wait a minute . Justin Timberlake ? And he 's the star ? I should have known better than to rent EDISON FORCE . In fact , I did know better . But in a moment of absolute weakness , I rented this STV . When you have big names like Freeman and Spacey in an STV , you know it 's one of two things : an indie or a dog . As in sat - on - a - shelf . Which this did . And with good reason . The plot as such involves a squad of corrupt killer cops a la MAGNUM FORCE , and " journalist " Timberlake is the only one brave enough to uncover them . He is targeted for his efforts -- or maybe I should say for his horrible acting . I turned it off after one of the bad guys was shot through the forehead and still had the forethought to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing . Just awful . The real tipoff to how bad this flick is to see Freeman on the cover and throughout the movie sporting an unruly beard , looking like nothing so much as a hobo . You just know the director was not in control . Freeman is clearly slumming .
pos	One of the things about the film that warmed my heart strings was that dry fly fishing was a major part of the scene . I have occasionally carried out my times of dry fly fishing , having tied my own flies , and being accompanied by my brother and my father we spend a day on one river or another seeking to tempt the ever elusive Brown Trout to rise and take the fly that has been offered to them . When we had occasions like this any differences between us disappeared and any of the pressures of the world melted away to be replaced by the glory of being absorbed in the activity and the surroundings of the place we were in . This was one of the amazing things that was portrayed to me in the film as the minister and his two sons , Norman and Pauly carried out the ritual . For there is something ritualistic about fly fishing as there is something ritualistic about so many pastimes . You ca n't just start casting your fishing line and hope for the best . You have to attune yourself to the place you are in , you have to scan the surface of the water considering how it is flowing and where the best point might be to place your fly and , depending on your skill level , you might even get your fly to land there long enough for a fish to take note of it and strike . The ' Art of Fly - fishing ' was directed and represented so well that they themselves can be classified as artists . The title for the film could not be more aptly chosen , for the river did in fact run through the life of father and two sons . This film however spreads itself broader than the family and community in Montana , by the the Blackfoot river , where the film is played out . It has the capacity to draw you in , to enthrall you , to capture you , as the history of the family , community and period is unfolded . The Story told is not just a family history , but a history of Life . What may be classified as a ' River of Life '
neg	The movie is an extra - long tale of a classic novel that completely fails to capture the original adventure 's spirit . The quite horribly American Patrick Swayze is cast as the British hero Allan Quatermain despite the obviousness of his nationality . The movie continues throughout to " Hollywood - ise " the story by changing both the plot and the characters to fit more comfortably into the accepted mold . The movie manages to be predictable throughout , even to those who are not familiar with the story and is plagued by some extremely bad acting and terribly disappointing fight sequences . All in all , a terrible addition to the already quite bad collection of movies based on the legend of King Soloman 's Mines and Allan Quatermain .
pos	Most people ( 36 ) gave this movie a 10 and those who do n't are being too critical or maybe expected something else . This is one of my favorite movies from the 80 's , it grows on you , and has it all . I just got it on DVD and 20 years later it still does not disappoint , having plenty of action , drama , romance , and even comedy . Add to that the great car chases , automatic weapon shootouts and lots of stuff blowing up and you have a fun , edge of your seat experience ! You will even be humming or whistling the main theme song for days after seeing this .   You can watch this movie with your wife / gf and you will both enjoy it lots . The premise is that of a paperback book hero , like Doc . Savage , really existing and helping people fight evil so he can write the story is almost true to life here . The actor Jake Speed is also a director , producer and writer of many films . In THIS film Jake Speed ( the character ) is an Indiana Jones adventurer type , he usually uses his head to get out of sticky situations but will sometimes resorts to brute firepower ( yay!,and sheer dumb luck too ! ) . Keep an eye out for his one " James Bond " hi - tech equipment , the ultimate road warrior SUV dropping out of the sky . The heroine is the very beautiful young love interest from the early Jim Carey vampire movie " Once Bitten " and here she is a little older and still a knockout even compared to her teenage blonde little sister . The bad guys are " real bad " men and are the worst lowlife villainous scum you love to hate . The ending is just perfect and can stand alone or invite a sequel , sadly never made - but you can just imagine what would happen next ! You have to see this movie just because it will entertain and amuse you and that 's worth the price of a ticket .
neg	I watched this movie at 3'o clock in the morning , a time in the day where I am usually very open when it comes to movies . But still I think it was n't good , this movie was n't good at all . The reasons why are many . The acting is n't all that good , and time after time situations occurring in it reminded me of a poor 90 's Chevy Chase comedy . I mean , come on , like the handcuff situation , and the poker situation amongst the servants ... This movie was so obviously based very much on the first one , and that s OK . But if I had n't seen the first one before seeing this , it would have sucked even worse . Like the ending , it came very suddenly , and I felt like I got no closure what so ever ... Sebastian changed very suddenly , and this This movie seems like it was made solely to explain nr 1 , and like no time or effort was used on making anything else good . The score is the same as in the first one , and it did n't feel like a movie at all ... They should have handled the situations with more style and class , but they did n't , and therefore , this movie turned out bad ...
pos	Gus Van Sant has made some excellent films . I truly am a fan . However , I ca n't help but feel that the cerebral edge of Tom Robbins book " Even Cowgirls Get the Blues " is lost in translation to the big screen . Alone , Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant are incredible visionaries and towers of talent . Ultimately though this one just did n't work .   It was n't that the characters were n't well developed or the plot and content did n't come alive . It 's just that our imaginations are much more powerful when reading a book like this . We 're taken away to a different time and place and we sometimes think the worst and/or the best and it adds to the overall roller - coaster of the book as it neatly unfolds according to the author 's precision . Movies however can leave one with less of the imagination and emotion roller - coaster detracting from the overall experience . This is what I believe happened here . I suggest reading the book !
neg	I was really , really disappointed with this movie . it started really well , and built up some great atmosphere and suspense , but when it finally got round to revealing the " monster" ... it turned out to be just some psycho with skin problems ...... again . Whoop - de - do . Yet another nutjob movie ... like we do n't already have enough of them . To be fair , the " creep " is genuinely unsettling to look at , and the way he moves and the strange sounds he makes are pretty creepy , but I 'm sick of renting film like this only to discover that the monster is human , albeit a twisted , demented , freakish one . When I saw all the tell - tale rats early on I was hoping for some kind of freaky rat - monster hybrid thing ... it was such a let down when the Creep was revealed . On top of this , some of the stuff in this movie makes no sense . ( Spoiler )   Why the hell does the Creep kill the security Guard ? What s the point , apart from sticking a great honking sign up that says " HI I 'm A PSYCHO AND I LIVE DOWN HERE ! " ? Its stupid , and only seems to happen to prevent Franka Potente 's character from getting help . what the hells he been eating down there ? I got the impression he was effectively walled in , and only the unexpected opening into that tunnel section let him loose ... so has he been munching rats all that time , and if so why do they hang around him so much ? Why is he so damn hard to kill ? He 's thin , malnourished and not exactly at peak performance ... but seems to keep going despite injuries that are equivalent to those that .cripple the non - psycho characters in the film . The DVD commentary says we are intended to empathise with Creep , but I just find him loathsome . Its an effective enough movie , but it wasted so many opportunities that it makes me sick .
pos	I saw this movie with my dad . I must have been pretty young , around 15 . It was on Star Movies one afternoon . The movie started a bit vaguely , but you could tell those robbers were gathering up for a score . It really caught pace after the first half hour . All the actors are great , especially Blades and Lou Diamond . I Guess it 's the ensemble , they just play so well together . I can watch this film anytime . I think it is the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters trying to deal with a very weird score . The jokes are not corny but they are subtle and extreme at the same time that make them so hilarious . A perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon .
neg	Well , I was excited at first to download an animated open source movie , only to be ruined by a demo reel . The animation is excellent , the lip syncing is awful , and you keep watching the movie hoping to understand what 's going on , only to realize nothing is going on . You feel no emotion for the characters , only pity for the creators for wasting their time . I have seen short films with twice the emotion in half the time ! This could of been an excellent short film , if they had just taken the time to hire a real director . I 'm sure everyone over at Blender is excited to showcase their software and its rendering capabilities , but sorry guys - story telling is what makes a movie .
pos	All of you who despaired looking at the emptiness and weaknesses of Disney Studios ' last productions , here comes something that should heal your wounds ... Once and for all , A Bug 's life brings the proof that purely synthetic pictures conducting a good scenario provides more interest than fake " hand - made - old - Disneys - like " drawings ( see the Lion King , Pocahontas , and all the latest productions where you sadly regret that Bambi 's magical background and atmosphere are gone forever ) . A bug 's life ( 1001 Pattes for my fellow french cinemaniaks ! ) succeeds in avoiding all the imperfections that make you awaken in the middle of the movie and say " Hey , this thing is computer generated ! " . No weak parts , a tremendous effort showing its efficiency in the backgrounds and the general look of the sets , an astonishing 3D bird ( close to perfection in its imitation of reality ) ... and that 's only to mention the technical aspects . The scenario , my friends , the real backbone of a motion picture , has some thickness ! Curiously , and obviously thanks to Lasseter 's team , there is practically no musical sequence in A bug 's life . Which means the story is long and rich enough to free itself from these 3 or 4 minutes that some kids appreciate , but most others dislike ( same thing for the parents or the anime fans , like me ) . This movie reminded me of a really old movie featuring Steve Martin and Chevy Chase : the 3 Amigos ; it had basically the same background story ( a whole mexican village living in the fear of a few bad guys hires gunmen ( who finally turn to be actors ) to protect them , etc ... ) . Simple , but efficient , and brilliantly adapted to a colony of frightened ants facing the wrath of vicious insects . Since Microcosmos , many movies tell tales of insects , their lives , fears and hopes , but I do think that A bug 's life is the funniest and best directed of all . The humanisation process has been perfectly well achieved ... And the whole audience was captivated by Flik 's ( aka Tilt in France ) adventures . A big thank you for Lasseter 's team , especially for the last 30 seconds ... it 's so strange and great at the same time to see a whole theater caught in laughter while the bugs / actors forget their lines or hit the camera ... And finally , especially for those of you who have seen the french version , other congratulations go to the dubbing actors who made a great synchro work on this movie . A bug 's life is a really good piece of entertainment , and I think it will soon become part of my collection of videos ( a privilege granted to extremely few movies , and that 's not a problem of storage room :) . Go and see it , that 's an order .
neg	Ok , I like B movies ... I know what B movies are supposed to represent . But this is just awful . I am amazed it got such a decent overall score . The only redeeming qualities of this flick are the ( mostly ) marginal splatter effects . Do n't get me wrong , gore abounds in this flick - but few effects really jumped out at me ( like the anal " probe" ... that was great ! ) . I believe this movie was filmed on a camcorder . C'mon - rent a Betacam at least , I 've seen porn with better production values ( and better acting as well ) . Acting - sucked ! But not in the Troma or Full Moon sort of way . Story - contrived ! But that s what you get from films like these . Very loose ! Sets & Props - sucked ! My 16 year old brother makes more elaborate sets for our house on Halloween . Dubbing and dialogue - sucked ! Horrible voice acting ( I should n't even call it acting ) and every other word is " S**t " or " F**k " . There are tons of good classic and B rated horror / splatter flicks out there and they are not that hard to track down . Do yourself a favor by not wasting time on this crap !
pos	I have n't seen this film in years so my knowledge is a little rusty . I do remember thinking that this film is twice the film of Braveheart . It is simply more realistic and has more believable characters . Ridb Roy looks like one would imagine Rob Roy to look like , messy hair and beard with simple clothing . Also the Liam Nesson has a Celtic look about him , he looks like a Scot and more importantly looks like Rob Roy . It 's a comparison which angers some people but compare him to Mel Gibson as William Wallace . Gibson is supposedly playing a man who 's legend has caused him to be described as a 6 foot 7 giant while Gibson is almost a foot shorter . The story contains a little romance , conspiracy and an underdog story . Sound anything like Braveheart ? But instead of a film that cries out " freedom " , liberty and nationalism we get a film which says honour , love and justice . This makes it a more interesting film . Much like Gladiator . The cast is fantastic and Liam Nesson is a very strong leader in this endeavour . The story is great with how it deals with heroism and humanity . The scene where Mary is raped and she walks out of the burning house with a look of true Scottish strength is followed by her washing the semen from her crotch in an extreme panic . This is something a heroine in Braveheart would never do . Overall this is a stunning and almost flawless watch . Go and see it !
neg	Rich ditzy Joan Winfield ( a woefully miscast Bette Davis ) is engaged to be married to stupid egotistical Allen Brice ( Jack Carson looking lost ) . Her father ( Eugene Palette ) is determined to stop the marriage and has her kidnapped by pilot Steve Collins ( James Cagney . Seriously ) . They crash land in the desert and hate each other but ( sigh ) start falling in love . This seems to be getting a high rating from reviewers here only because Cagney and Davis are in it . They were both brilliant actors but they were known for dramas NOT comedy and this movie shows why ! The script is just horrible -- there 's not one genuine laugh in the entire movie . The running joke in this has Cagney and Davis falling rump first in a cactus ( this is done THREE TIMES ! ) . Only their considerable talents save them from being completely humiliated . As it is they both do their best with the lousy material . Cagney tries his best with his lines and Davis screeches every line full force but it does n't work . Carson has this " what the hell " look on his face throughout the entire movie ( probably because his characters emotions change in seconds ) . Only Palette with his distinctive voice and over the top readings manges to elicit a few smiles . But , all in all , this was dull and laughless -- a real chore to sit through . This gets two stars only for Cagney and Davis ' acting and some beautiful cinematography but really -- it 's not worth seeing . Cagney and Davis hated this film in later years and you can see why .
pos	Good show . The basic background is that humanity is at a crossroads . There is a set of moral dilemmas that are being faced . Mankind has made a number of technological breakthroughs , but is mankind mature enough to deal with the its new toys ? There is moral decadence in a virtual world . There are religious fanatics who are willing to kill to get attention . I predict ( based on the BSG background ) that there will be an issue with Cylons and slavery . In addition to this , there are all the other problems that we humans bring upon ourselves . This show is not BSG -- at least not as far as mankind being on the run from a ruthless problem that was ultimately of their own making . There are not a lot of shoot - em - up or space - based special effects either - at least not in the first few episodes I have seen so far . What it does have are very good stories , characters , and themes . It also has good performances from the actors . They can make a culture which is similar to modern - day society , but alien at the same time be completely believable . Like BSG , this show is about humanity - our strengths , weaknesses , potential , and flaws . It may seem a little odd that a human society on a different set of worlds has neckties , antique cars , and chicken . But those things are really more to create a semi - familiar background than anything else . Anyone who gets stuck on those details is really missing the point . Whether you are from a mafia - style culture or an affluent and high - tech culture , humans and human nature are n't that different 150,000 years ago in a high - tech past than what we see in the world today . Wonder if the writers are trying to tell us something .
neg	waste of my life , .... the director should be embarrassed . why people feel they need to make worthless movies will never make sense to me . when she died at the end , it made me laugh . i had to change the channel many times throughout the film because i was getting embarrassed watching such poor acting . hopefully the guy who played Heath never gets work again . On top of that i hope the director never gets to make another film , and has his paycheck taken back for this crap . { .02 out of 10 }
pos	After Fatih Akins first work " I m Juli " , which was fairly good , he created a really gorgeous italian family epic . Its a german movie , which is unfortunately a bad precondition , cause we rareley produce more than moderate movies ;) . But this movie makes some very good snapshots of the time then . " Solino " is about a Italian immigrant who arrives in the " Ruhr " region of Germany during the 60s . The immigrant and his family then start the first Pizza restaurant in the region . The characters are excellent drawn . Especially Gigi , the main actor . You live every second , every feeling he does . His brother , played by Moritz Bleibtreu , is nt that good . Well , you just do nt believe him the role . But the character is wellbalanced and fits perfectly into this script . I feel an urgent need to compare the style of this movie with the style of " The Godfather " . Many people will probably hate this movie , say its boring . Not much tension ? - yes , but an outrageous movie . 9 out of 10 .
neg	I always found Betsy Drake rather creepy , and this movie reinforces that . As another review said , this is a stalker movie that is n't very funny . I watched it because it has CG in it , but he hardly gets any screen time . It 's no " North by Northwest " ...
pos	To me movies and acting is all about telling a story . The story of David and Bethsheba is a tragedy that is deep and can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical account . In this movie I thought the storytelling by Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward were at their best . To know and understand the story of David and his journey to become the King of Israel , made this story all the more compelling . You could feel his lust for a beautiful woman , Gregory Peck showed the real human side of this man who in his time was larger than life . Susan Hayward 's fear , reluctance , but then obedience to his authority as her King was beautifully portrayed by her . One could also feel David 's anguish the nigh that Uriah spent the night at the gate instead of at home . As well as the sadness when he was killed in battle . Raymond Massey 's powerful and authoritative condemnation of the King made me feel his anger . The sets were real enough , and the atmosphere believable . All in all I think this was one of the best movies of it 's kind . I gave it a rating of ten .
neg	This is one of the worst movies I saw ! I dunno what are the reasons for shoting suck a crap . Do n't waste your time watching this . Good actors , but extremely bad screenplay and dialogues . Hope there 'll be no Blanche 2 :-) Avoid this movie by all means !
pos	it brings to mind the writings of Stephen King and the remembered childhoods filled with terror from stories like IT - as the exact opposite . There is no terror in these childhoods that any of the friends - who are still friends 20 years up the line - remember or seem to suffer from . Up the line all is described as friendly jostling , maybe periodically described as " picking on " one or more of them , but all is forgiven . There is no * angst * embedded as the film and the participants in later life describe the relationships - all we see are young people having grown up to be basically the same persons . More mature , but basically still the same people , and the same power structures . Totally amazing ! Not just for the fact that people can in fact grow up relatively unharmed by social conventions - but also that friendships can in fact last . In this respect this movie is a tiny Pearl - as one assumes this has been the intent of the film : A portrait of unforced emotions binding people together . Which , when seen in opposition to films of later years portraying the dark sides of childhood - the violent inhibitions in Bowling for Combine is what easily springs to mind , but since mid 80'ies along with the growing adoration of children and childhood ( accompanied by 1000s of commercials , animations and series directed straight at children ) several movies and documentaries have had success with portraying the dark sides of growing up - the abuse , the loneliness , the push to excel - resulting in adults with dark and twisted minds . And here comes a film , that says : It IS possible to have a happy childhood , look'a'here ! Thank you for that . OR the counterweight illusion ... 8/10
neg	It looks like the brilliant team of Shonda Rhimes outsourced the writing of this one somewhere offshore , maybe to the MediocreLand ? " PP " reminds me any one of the many tedious , promising at first but predictable within 1 season David Kelly flicks ( Picket Fences , Ally McBeal , and now Boston Legal ) . The crazy cases they get are so outlandish , they barely evoke sympathy or sadness . And that 's what actually makes good medical dramas tick - dramatic situations you are afraid of , " This could be me " sentiment . They are not funny either . The actors are quite good , but the plot lines are dead and can not be brought back to live . I 'm a therapist , and let me tell you - Amy Brennan plays the most unbelievably incompetent , unethical , untrained therapist . Whoever writes her stuff flunked the ethics and the transference / counter - transference courses in Stanford . Somebody should give them a Code of Ethics to read ( the episode with the nose - bleeding wife and the therapist 's involvement in it ) . No therapists are that bad . Women yearning for men who have moved on - had been done to death , we 've all graduated " Sex and the City " . Addison in her youthful aggression towards the guy she likes - very age - inappropriate , looks so unnatural on a woman over 40 , and this otherwise talented actress does n't believe it herself and does n't deliver it very well . The only successful / palatable developments are Addison struggling with her decision to move to LA , and the " Voodoo Dr " and his coping with widowhood . This concept might work with a whole new writing team .
pos	While I do n't agree with Bob 's and Tammy 's decision to give up baby Jesse , and it 's something I 'd never do , they were trying to do what was best for the baby . The way this movie is written , you see yourself becoming wrapped up in the story and asking yourself what you really believe , from all different aspects . Patty Duke ? Antagonist ? Almost unheard of , as far as I 'm concerned . But during the movie , she really convinces you that she 's psychotic , or at least , that there 's something seriously wrong with her . Her character is the meaning of " emotionally disturbed . " The movie seems to end quickly , leaving things somewhat unresolved . But other than that , this movie is really great . It really makes you think . It 's not a movie to watch when you just want to kick back and relax and watch something cute that 'll make you laugh . But it is a good movie to see when you want to challenge your own beliefs , see things from others ' perspectives , and discover a little something about yourself . Caution : you may even grow while watching this movie ! And it 's all worth it , in the end .
neg	One previous reviewer called this film " pure visual joy " I am wondering if s / he saw the same film that I did . " High Art " had to have the most relentlessly depressing interiors since " Seven " . One can almost forgive Sheedy and Mitchell for the cliché of going to a B&B for their First Time . Of course , before they do that , one has to watch opium - den parties inhabited by people who are not apparently gainfully employed but can somehow support a flourishing drug habit . Not to mention the icy stares from those familiar movie types , the Girlfriend / Boyfriend At Start , who are well aware they 're going to be thrown over sometime in the next 100 minutes or so . The movie also states that the Sheedy character has retired from professional photography for ten years now . What did she do , retire at age twenty ?
pos	I was so glad I came across this short film . I 'm always so disappointed that short films are hard to come across , so when I saw this and saw that it was nominated for the Live Action Short Film at the Academy Awards , I was so pleased that I actually had a film that I was rooting for . The plot is pretty simple , the director , writer , and star Nacho Vigalondo tried coming up with a reason people would suddenly break out into a song and dance number like they do in movie musicals . The result is extremely entertaining and the song is actually really catchy . It 's a well made short film , well edited and the actors all do a great job . And the last shot of the film is perfect . I highly recommend this film .
neg	Written by the excellent McGovern and directed by Frears this film was a slight disappointment . It seemed too short . It spent far too long creating the Hovis atmosphere , and laughing at the Catholic demands . Then very quickly you have the fascist and socialists vying for the family 's attention , and the terrible conclusion . Still my wife thought Liam was cute .
pos	Brilliant ! My wife and I joined the sprawling line to see Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival . After seeing the film , I can understand why there was such a long line . Holly is a touching story about an impossible connection between two people . She is a young girl , he is a worn out westerner . The film grasped every bone in our body . There are n't any graphic scenes or anything that is hard to watch - its the surrealism of normality that really kicks you in the gut . The film is beautifully shot . Among others , we loved the scene where Patrick teaches Holly to ride a small motorcycle . Thuy Ngoyen 's rawness ( ca nt believe this is her first acting job)and Ron Livingston 's performance stayed with me for a couple of days . Highly recommended .
neg	This movie made me feel as if I had missed some important scenes from the very beginning . There were continuity errors and plots that stopped as abruptly as they started . I was very disappointed because I love Whoopi Goldberg & Danny Glover , in addition to that have always trusted & respected Danny Glovers taste in his choice of roles , " Grand Canyon " for example . I just could not finish this movie , after what seemed an eternity , but was probably just a little over an hour ; we had to turn it off . There was no comedy , there was nothing about the characters to make you empathize or sympathize with them , there was no evoking of emotion at all regarding this movie and the clips of their past were poorly edited , confusing , and unnecessary . What could have been a great idea for a movie , even as a drama & not a comedy ( although I think a comedy in this situation would have been better , because I love to watch white people freak out & start acting like complete idiots , it makes me laugh ) became a waste of my $ 1 credit at the video store .
pos	One of my favorite movies I saw at preview in Seattle . Tom Hulce was amazing , with out words could convey his feelings / thoughts . I actually sent Mike Ferrell some donation money to help the film get distributed . It is good . System says I need more lines but do not want to give away plot stuff . I was in the audience in Seattle with Hulce and director , a writer I think and Mike Ferrell . They talked for about an hour afterwords . Not really a dry eye in the house . Why Hollywood continues to be stupid I do not know . ( actually I do know , it is our fault , look what we watch)Well you get what you pay for guys . Get this and see it with someone special . It is a gem .
neg	Well , I 'll start by admitting I 'm not a John Ford fan . ( I watched " The Informer " only because I 'm trying to work my way through a list of the " greats . " ) So if you are , just move along , 'cause you 're not going to agree with me . What an overwrought and dated piece of silliness this is ! I will say that there is a good idea for a movie here ( it made me think about how few films there are about the Irish Revolution ) but , as usual , Ford is determined to bury it under over - acting and cheap sentiment . I suppose it 's somewhat interesting to watch for a while in order to see the less - than - seamless transition that was being made from the silents to the " talkies " -- the acting styles of some of the principals have that overbroad quality endemic to early films and movie does feel as if it might play better with title cards than spoken dialogue . ( Of course , title cards would prevent Ford from restating every bit of emotion six times . ) What dialogue there is usually has a " They 're always after me Lucky Charms ! " quality that is aggravated by the fact that each actor seems to have been allowed to use his or her own personal version of an Irish accent . Of course , as bad as they are , the accents are helpful in reminding us we 're in Ireland because the sets mostly look as if they were dragged in from from some German expressionist piece being filmed on the next soundstage over . ( It feels as if , with an eagle eye , you might see some villagers off to torch Dr. Frankenstein in the background . ) Techniques change . Tastes change . So I wo n't go off on how crazy it seems that this film was so acclaimed in its day . But it 's not one of the classics that hold up --- more just " fair warning " about the kind of over - simplified malarkey to which Ford was going to devote his career .
pos	I found ' Time At The Top ' an entertaining and stimulating experience . The acting , while not generally brilliant , was perfectly acceptable and sometimes very good . As a film obviously aimed at the younger demographic , it is certainly one of the better works in the genre ( Children 's Sci - Fi ) . Normally , I would say that Canada , the United Kingdom and Australia produce the best movies and TV shows for children , and ' Time At The Top ' does nothing to discount this theory ! I do n't think that continuity and great acting are important to younger people . A good plot and an imaginative screenplay are far more important to them . Both are in abundance in this film . The special effects are good , without detracting from the story , or closing the viewers off from their own imaginations . It would have been very easy to inject an over - load of SFX in this film , but it would have totally destroyed its entire ' Raison D'etre ' .   The settings and camera work are of a very high standard in this movie , and complement the fine wardrobe and historical accuracy . Overall , this film is highly satisfactory , and I recommend it to all viewers who can see the world through children 's eyes , or those that try to , like myself ! Now , I really must read the original book , as soon as possible .
neg	I am usually disappointed by network movies . Even flix that attract big name actors are usually ruined by the TV people . However , this one is the worst of the worst . The screenplay is weak and the acting , especially that of Tracey Pollan is abominable . I 've trudged off to see my kids'high school plays and been treated to better acting . Pollan acts as if she is reading the script as she speaks . When she tries to express fear , anger or grief , it 's extremely hollow . Because of the overall quality of the production I found it difficult to take it seriously . If you decide to brave this one just be prepared for a big disappointment . Scary things wo n't scare you , sad things wo n't make you sad , romance wo n't make you feel warm and fuzzy and you will likely be as anxious as I was to see the end arrive . " First to die " says a lot about this movie .
pos	This was a wonderful little American propaganda film that is both highly creative AND openly discusses the Nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed . While late 1944 and into 1945 would reveal just how evil and horrific they were , this film , unlike other Hollywood films to date , is the most brutally honest film of the era I have seen regarding Nazi atrocities . The film begins in a courtroom in the future -- after the war is over ( the film was made in 1944 - -the war ended in May , 1945 ) . In this fictitious world court , a Nazi leader is being tried for war crimes . Wilhelm Grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one witnesses are called who reveal Grimm 's life since 1919 in a series of flashbacks . At first , it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how Grimm was pushed to join the Nazis . However , after a while , it becomes very apparent that Grimm is just a sadistic monster . These episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama . All in all , the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars second - tier actors . There are many compelling scenes and performances -- especially the very prescient Jewish extermination scene towards the end that ca n't help but bring you close to tears . It was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some super - creative scenes that use crosses in a way you might not notice at first . Overall , it 's a must - see for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good film . FYI -- This is not meant as a serious criticism of the film , but Hitler was referred to as " that paper hanger " . This is a reference to the myth that Hitler had once made money putting up wallpaper . This is in fact NOT true -- previously he 'd been a " starving artist " , homeless person and served well in the German army in WWI . A horrible person , yes , but never a paper hanger !
neg	This is the most elementary sort of traditional ghost story , not even enlivened to any great extent by the use of Irish locations . If the great M.R. James had ever come up with a tale this thin -- does n't James in fact have a story called " A Thin Ghost " ? -- he would n't have bothered to have it published . Orson Welles appears in the limp endpieces as a favour to a brace of old friends , this film 's producers . His presence and the one movie industry in - joke would have earned this will - o'-the - wisp its Oscar nomination . This is yet more proof , if any more were needed , that the Academy Awards have never been any guarantee of merit .
pos	It was only on my second viewing , years later , that I realized two things about this movie : 1 ) I enjoyed it immensely , and 2 ) that because its execution is decidedly sharper than the premise itself warrants . I had laughed my way through the movie before it occurred to me to renew my initial protests -- valleyspeak and loogies and airheadedness ( even * good*-natured airheadedness ) just are n't inherently funny , especially when drawn out to feature length . But though the movie 's momentum does begin to sputter out towards the end , Reeves and Winter and Sadler ( and Hal Landon Jr. in an unforgettable scene ) display such a remarkable sense of comic timing throughout that even the more clumsily - scripted jokes ( e.g. Ted failing to recognize a certain inhabitant of Hell ) work as effortlessly as the witter ones ( e.g. the challenge ) . And the teaming of Winter and Reeves clicks so well that the teaming of Bill and Ted ( who spend only one scene separated in the entire movie , disaster if they 're not well - matched ) appears utterly unstrained . ( Side note : I found the first movie to be only sporadically entertaining -- sightly different comic sensibilities there , it seems . ) I give it a 7.75 . Surprisingly good fun .
neg	This is the prime example of low budget , winning over what would be a good story line . Let 's bring back Samaire Armstrong ( having seen her work on the O.C. I know she can do better ) , then find a better script and budget . The special effects were so bad , and mostly badly computer generated , that it almost lost me with the first time the wolf was seen on - screen . And Samaire Armstrong 's ( alert!)changing into a werewolf was done by reducing her at first to a bad GCIF figure before she even begins to change(Final Fantasy 's humans , as well as Pixar 's made these laughable , think of the figure as a nude Barbie Doll ) . The story of was interesting , though the idea of bloodline in werewolves is nothing new . As it also got into the balance between evil , ( maybe ) not so evil , and the possible end of human - kind should the two lines mate . The subplot of a " book of werewolf linage " which effected some of the other characters in a spell - like manner for a while was effective , but could have been expanded more in explaining what had happened in the past .   Bring in a better script and direction , and I 'd come back again .
pos	The 14 year - old in me is immensely happy that they 're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies , and that they 're all the rage , what with Lord of the Rings , Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia making loads of cash at the box office . This year will see ( and already has seen ) several more , most notably The Golden Compass , which has the most exciting trailer I 've seen this year . Stardust , based on a novel by Neil Gaiman , showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep . I saw no previews for it , only a couple of commercials . The critical reaction is kind of blah . I would n't even have seen it if not for the fact that I have to wait on a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum , and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend . Well , if you 'll forgive the horrible pun , the stars must have been rightly aligned , because I went to see Stardust , and I loved it . It 's not a huge movie like Lord of the Rings . The plot line is your very basic fantasy quest ( the hero sets out to look for a fallen star ) filled with obstacles . But within that basic outline , the story is lively and imaginative . It 's simply aiming to be a lot of fun , and a charming little romance . And it succeeds wonderfully . There were a lot of big films this summer , but none of them were nearly as fun as this one . There 's a lot going on , but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent . It is n't a masterpiece , but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like The Princess Bride has ( though I do n't like it quite as much as the earlier film ) . A lot of fun to be had here if you 're a fan of the genre .
neg	This clunker of a film sets a new standard for bad filmmaking . Jared Rushton gives an adequate performance of a very poorly - created character in an ill - fated movie , thereby creating a net effect of a very bad movie . The film 's main thrust is how a boy 's temporary excursion into the Canadian wilderness after surviving a plane crash solo allows the disgruntled adolescent to deal with his anguish over discovering his mother 's extramarital affair . Unfortunately it turns into a bizarre collage of random " survival events " ( including two especially hokey scenes involving fighting a bear ) and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this kid is n't just sitting in an alley somewhere on pot dreaming up this whole movie ( and what a nightmare it is ! ) . Furthermore , despite the heralds of some reviewers of the family viewability of the film , there are several scenes not suitable for very young children or family viewing , including a graphic scene of the dead pilot underwater with one of his eyes apparently exploded . All in all , a terrible movie that nobody should be subjected to , much less innocent kids .
pos	This movie for what it is , may be one of the most amazing indie films of recent day . Made on a super small budget , the film has special effects that blow away alot of the current films ! IF you have a chance watch it !
neg	Apparently none of the previous reviewers , most of whom praise the film for its accuracy , have actually read a biography of Louis Pasteur . The most glaring inaccuracy is in the relationship between Pasteur and Napoleon III.Back in the 1930 's the latter was invariably shown in a bad light . While far from an admirable character - he was an inept politician and a self - appointed " military genius " who allowed France to be dragged into a disastrous war , he was not the stupid reactionary depicted here . He had an intelligent interest in science , and like many other people in the 19th century saw a bright future because of the improvements it would bring . Far from exiling Pasteur , he was his PATRON , building him a laboratory and providing him with all the resources that he needed for his research . While the lab was under construction , Pasteur became gravely ill . A bureaucrat , deciding it was a waste of money to build a laboratory for someone who would soon be dead , ordered work halted on his own authority . When the emperor heard about this , his outrage shook the bureaucracy so that there was a flurry of buck - passing , and work promptly resumed . The Emperor personally visited Pasteur to comfort him and reassure him that he would get his lab . The emperor would often bring members of his court to admire Pasteur 's projects , and it was obvious to everyone that Pasteur was one of the emperor 's favorites . Pasteur 's main worry concerning the Emperor was that Napoleon thought Pasteur was virtually a miracle worker who could do almost anything , and was constantly assigning him tasks outside of his previous experience . Pasteur , a very modest man , was always protesting this , but Napoleon would say that he had complete faith in him , and Pasteur despite his misgivings , always came through . They always had a close and friendly relationship , and after the Emperor was overthrown , Pasteur refused to say a bad word about him , grateful to the end of his life . The part about his daughter having the baby , and Pasteur sacrificing his principles to get a doctor , never happened . The part about the anthrax and rabies , for which he was famous , is generally correct , but the notion that the anthrax experiment raised him from obscurity to fame is false . He was famous and respected at the time this happened . This movie is OK from a dramatic standpoint , but very distorted as biography .
pos	I sincerely hope that at least the first season of Cosby is released on DVD someday . The episode with Hilton 's eccentric genius brother , George ( played by the late Roscoe Lee Browne ) , is classic hilarity . It reflects the classic sibling rivalry and love between brothers whose lives took different paths but both ended up happy . Mr. Cosby and Ms. Rashad brilliantly recaptured the chemistry that they shared on The Cosby Show for many years and to put them in a more middle - class role shows the dimensions they can take as artists .   The roster of comedic dynamite ... Madeline Kahn , Phylicia Rashad , and Mr. Cosby ... classic genius !
neg	In fact , Marc Blitzstein 's off - Broadway adaptation of " Threepenny " was not so " bowdlerised " as is generally believed . ( I have a special interest in " Threepenny " ; my dad was part of the first full production in the US ; U of Illlinois Theatre Guild did it around the end of WW2 . HJitler had been so nearly successful in suppressing the play that they had to reconstruct the script and score from recordings in two different languages { neither English } , a German prompter 's script and similar sources . ) Blitzstein 's adaptation -- not a " translation " -- which had the full approval of Lotte Lenya -- was a lot closer to the original than generally believed . The problem is that the version thereof that most people know is the MGM cast recording ( recently available on Polygram on CD)(which includes Beatrice Arthur { as Lucy , the " big complete girl " , and ca n't i see her hands on hips and shoulders thrown back on that line -- Bea was a major babe in the 50 's } , Paul Dooley and John Astin ) was heavily censored by Mike Curb , head of MGM Records -- i mean , 17 ( i think it was ) " Goddamn"s got cut to just " damn " . ( At one time , MGM also offered a 2-LP set of the * entire * play , doubtless as heavily censored . )
pos	I 'm probably one of the biggest Nancy Drew fans out there . I 've read every book three times over and I 've played a lot of the Nancy drew games . I Loved this movie . It kept you entertained the whole time you watched it . I went with about 10 of my friends and everyone LOVED it . There were three woman sitting behind us who appeared to be in their late 30 's to early 40 's and I asked them how they liked it , they said they loved it ! So you see it will be an entertainment to all ages . You just have to give it a chance . And it teaches a lesson too , just be yourself even if everyone around you is exactly alike . So overall , this move was great . I 'm going to see it a second time now ! So stop bashing it please . Its a really good movie !
neg	" Three Daring Daughters " is a sickly sweet , rose - colored look at divorce , remarriage , and single - parent living . Obviously , social issues and economic difficulty have no place in the picture perfect life of a single parent mother who feels exhausted , takes a cruise , and then dates and marries a band conductor . Even when the " its just a movie " phrase excuses the script from addressing real - life problems , ' Daughters ' suffers from too many incoherent high - note songs , children whose personalities are not based on real children and band leader Hose Iturbi playing himself . Is n't it bizarre that any real person would star in a film in which their supposed real self gets married ?   Admittedly , this movie was released in the nineteen forties . Only a love for old style Hollywood romance and comedy could make ' Daughters ' a tolerable film .
pos	* * WARNING - CONTAINS SPOILERS ! * * First of all , I would like to say that I really liked this game . I got it for Christmas after two months of dropping hints to my parents . I am glad that I did that . First off , I would like to say that the single player was very good . The first level is probably one of the best in the game , when you are at a party in London , and some evil guys ruin it by kidnapping the Prime minister 's daughter . Of course you have to rescue her , and it is quite a big level , but should probably take you at least five minutes . The best part , and I think also the funniest part , is when you are in the jet - pack , and people are rappelling down Big Ben . Just equip the jet - pack 's most trusty rocket launcher and blast the clock faces and the enemies down . Pure fun ! The rest of the levels are very good , but pretty short . There are four mini - levels you can unlock , and that is one of the let downs , because only the first two of them are actually fun , and the last two to unlock are just ' kill 25 enemies ' objectives , I mean , c'mon ! We got loads of points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad ! The multi player , me and some of my friends agree , is very good and challenging , even if there are no bots . Halo did n't have any bots but that is still some fine multi player games ! You can be a load of bad guys , and you go against each other , and you can also set traps , which is the best way of killing people without going into view of their character . Gameplay - 8.5/10 ( levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions could be improved ) . Graphics - 9/10 ( there is the odd bad graphic , but that is n't extremely often ) . Multiplayer - 10/10 ( needs no comment , just great , you get to drive in jet - packs and vehicles ) . Sound - 8/10 Replay value - 7/10 ( the only levels I go back on are the Loondon level and Istanbul Part 1 ) . I give this game : 8.5/10 Could have a bit of improvement , but it 's still good .
neg	I ca n't really think of any redeeming features of this utterly bad rendering on Asimov than the art direction . Forget the product placement disaster , the unconvincing performance from Will Smith and the gargantuan plot - holes . This was n't only laughable and but painful to watch . Even the action was boring . A mixture of MTV inspired production values and utterly bad dialogue probably aimed at very small children . What a shame that sci - fi this bad can still be made after we 've had Bladerunner , Minority Report or to a lesser extent Dark City ( by the same director ) . This one really belongs in the bottom 100 list . Truly awful .
pos	A great story , based on a true story about a young black man and all the difficulties along the road . Being that this is Denzel Washington 's first ever movie that he himself was gon na direct , i have to admit i was a tad sceptical , but who would n't be .. ? But then again , he 's a great actor with plently of years of experience , and the end result turned out great . The story is told in a great way , making you that has had difficulties during your childhood , and young adulthood , see yourself in those situations . So , it hits you hard , letting you know your not the only one going through hell . In all , a touching story about a young man trying to make it in this f***ed up world . ( The story is based on the life of Antwone Fisher , born 3 . August 1959 , Cleveland , Ohio , USA , whom was also the writer of this movie ) Strongly recommended . 8/10
neg	Just a few words .... This movie really sucks . It 's like those TV Movies with bad cast and plot . It 's amazing how they could make this sequel worse than the III . Do n't waste your time watching this crap , even if you like the tremors movies .
pos	Not one of your harder - hitting stories , and that 's a real strength of this film . There are at least two relationships in which less confident writers would have added some all - too predictable romantic tension . They not only spare the audience this , but throw in some surprises at the same time . There are a few Disney - ish moments , particularly near the end , but they are manageable . Overall , it was worth the rental and it was good , relaxed fun . BTW , if you get the DVD , watch the segment where the director teaches you how to make aloo gobi . We followed her directions and it was BRILLIANT ! Next time we will make it the day before we plan to eat it , because this is one dish that definitely gets better with a full night in the fridge to let the spices out !
neg	I saw the trailer to this film and it looked great , so I went out and bought it . What a mistake , the acting is a shambles , the special effects ( if you could call them that ) , look like something that would n't be out of place at a school play . Some of the characters are so stupid in this film you will cringe the minute they are on the screen , which unfortunately is all to often . As for a story , forget it . This is a warning , do n't waste any money at all on this film it has to be one of the worst things I have ever seen . If , for some reason , you like this film watch Troll 2 , you will probably enjoy that as well .
pos	In Cinema Retro magazine # 2,it is revealed that Mark Lester 's voice was actually dubbed by a 20 year old female , Kathe Green . Although Leste was considered perfect for the title role , director Carol Reed was not at all pleased with his singing abilities . The secret was revealed by on a 2004 UK documentary titled " Oliver ! After They Were Famous " . Greene was paid 400 pounds for her work and she had to agree to keep her participation secret , as did Mark Lester . They kept their word and only revealed this fact as part of the TV show decades after release of the film . For the record , Mark Lester retired from acting and is a practicing osteopath in England .
neg	I really do n't understand all these positive user reviews . This movie is the worst movie I 've ever seen and I 'm not trying to be pessimistic . Eva Mendez is hot but terrible in this film . But I do n't think it is her own fault but the directors . He have somehow managed to make everything look artificial ; their acting , the idea , the make - up , everything . The star I 'm giving is only for the idea behind the movie , which was very bad executed . Do n't watch this bullshit , go watch a Fellini , Woody Allen or some David Lynch .
pos	Ecstasy ( 1933 ) ( USA 1940 ) Starring Hedy Lamarr ( as Hedy Kiesler ) The world 's first glimpse of a 19 year - old Hedy Lamarr occurs in the early moments of this 1930 's treasure as she sweeps across the screen in an angelic wedding gown . This was to be the start of a legendary career . This was our glorious introduction to the most beautiful woman ever to grace the silver screen . It is Eva 's ( Lamarr ) wedding night and her older husband seems uninterested in her romantic advances . She retreats to the lonely bed and , in a beautiful scene , she fiddles with her wedding ring as the realization of her marital mistake overcomes her . The husband seems more interested in neatness and order than he does in love . Gustav Machaty uses gorgeous camera angles and pristine shot framing to capture Lamarr 's considerable talent and beauty . With no words spoken in the early part of the film , she is able to grasp our sympathy , our hearts and our support . It is that combination that prepared the 1930 's audiences for what they were about to see as the film unfolded . ' Ecstasy ' was considered shocking for its time ... Some thought it to be scandalous . She returns home to her father 's estate and files for divorce . The next day , she wakes with a complete sense of freedom and happiness . She just has to go outside and feel the freedom of the countryside and fresh air . Eva goes for a horseback ride and happens across a beautiful lake . And in one of the most famous scenes in film history , Hedy Lamarr became the first person to ever appear nude in a major film . Her frolic in the woods and her skinny - dipping adventure in the lake were legendarily scandalous . But the audiences could n't stay away . As with many of today 's movies , the controversy made it a must - see film . Eva 's mischievous adventure introduces her to a handsome young man who helps her find her horse , who had run off with her clothes . After an awkward meeting , they eventually fall for each other . Their first romantic rendezvous was almost as controversial as the nude scene , with its blatant waves of eroticism . However , Machaty does beautiful work in these romantic moments . Machaty creates one delightful moment , when Eva literally seems to sink into her new lover , using a gorgeous early camera trick . It can not be overstated how brave this performance was on Lamarr 's part . Many might have presumed it was career suicide . Instead , it gained her worldwide fame and caught the eye Louis B Mayer , who signed her to a contract with MGM . There are some truly erotic moments in this film , even by today 's raunchy standards . It is impossible to imagine how they were received in the 1930 's . Again , Machaty was very clever with his imagery , leaving a lot to the imagination . But we all understand very well what we are seeing and it is supremely well done . The meeting of Eva 's former husband and her current lover is perhaps inevitable . However , the consequences of that meeting are not . The film takes a few unexpected turns in its final act and it all makes for a great story and a lovely debut on the grand stage of movie stardom for Hedy Lamarr . I highly recommend this once controversial , now tame film and urge you to seek it out in its restored form on DVD . It is easily worthwhile , if only for the pleasure of seeing Hedy Lamarr . But the story is compelling too and the direction is ahead of its time . ' Ecstasy ' is a memorable early treasure . www.tccandler.com - TC Candler 's Movie Reviews ! ! !
neg	This reboot is like a processed McDonald 's meal compared to Ang Lee 's very good but very underrated 2003 " The Incredible Hulk " . Ang Lee 's " The Hulk " is a comic book movie for the thinking person . The Hulk takes some time to appear ( about 40 minutes ) , but when he does we see the conflict at our protagonist 's core . He does his best to avoid losing control , but as he admits , when he does give in to his rage , he likes it . Now compare this to Edward Norton 's turn , where there is no display of conflict in his personality , and he turns into the Hulk whenever he becomes excited and his pulse rate hits 200 beats per minute ( not 183 , not 197 , but exactly 200 ) . To this reviewer , this felt akin to the introduction of midi - chlorians in The Phantom Menace , which tell how strong the " force " is with one , as if mystical abilities can be gauged through a blood test . In the 2008 movie , all Ed Norton 's Bruce Banner has to do is to keep his pulse rate under 200 , as monitored by a device strapped onto his wrist . And for the record , it is extremely difficult to get one 's pulse rate up to 200 even through a very exhilarating run , especially for a physically fit person . Emotions drive Eric Bana 's Hulk . He has repressed memories of his mother 's death and his father 's role in his early life . On the surface he is calm , but there underneath there is significant anger , enough rage to fuel the Hulk when it is unleashed . But the Hulk never kills intentionally , even his attackers . Mostly , he just wants to get away or close to Betty Ross ( Jennifer Connelly ) . He incapacitates his shooters and in one critical scene , saves a fighter jet pursuing him from a collision . In the 2003 movie , the visual effects are there , but as necessary . The action scenes ( and there are plenty of them ) are necessary to the plot , unlike the 2008 movie where action is inserted for the sake of action . In his quest to turn it into a " fugitive " story , Ed Norton loses focus on how Bruce Banner feels about the Hulk . To him , the Hulk is a dangerous side effect of an experiment went awry . And Louis Leterrier , the director picking up on Ed Norton 's cue , fails to add any emotional dimension to the Banner - Hulk relationship . The story can be summed up as : Banner is pursued and Hulk kicks butt , Banner is pursed and Hulk kick butt . Repeat as necessary . The only thing that went against the 2003 movie is that it is perhaps not as true to the comic books as the 2008 version . However , even as I am a fan of the comics , I would prefer a movie that is not as true to the comics as a fanboy 's dream but has heart over the comics - loyal but manufactured and soulless 2008 version any day . Perhaps Ang Lee should have read more comics . Iron Man , also released in 2008 , is a perfect example of a movie that is true to its comic - book roots and has heart .
pos	This film is a great fun . I recommend you watch it yourself and then watch it again with your friends . I did last night and it was fascinating how well Norma Khouri could pull everybody into her world ! I did feel a little bit strange watching my friends go through the same roller coaster as I did the first time . But they all thanked me and loved the movie . You know it is a great film if you spend 2 hours after the film talking about the movie !   I once saw a con man almost up toNorma Khouri 's level , but no where near the same size ring . He fooledtons of very gullible and rich folks at my old Berkeley CA A.A. group where everyone trusts everyone else . He would " sponsor " only people who seemed very well to do . Who knew he would have stolen in excess of 100k(in 1987 when that was real money ) after being in town for only 1 month . His victims were very fragile as they were in their first month or week of being sober . He was evil with a great laugh and a great smile on his face . The above crime is nothing compared to what Norma Khouri did to her old neighbor . But I do n't want to give anything away . I just found this one night on a late night movie channel,"Showtim " I think . This is always a movie fans greatest experience to be totally tricked into seeing something and having your mind blown . Just drag your friends over to see this and do n't tell them a thing . It is a very entertaining film , it moves quickly and never bores you . This should be a international classic for all time . I believe all great movies eventually rise to the top . Time will be very good to this film . I am just sorry no one has heard of it yet , in some ways that makes the surprises even better . The director and editor were fantastic . They deserved winning the best documentary . JUST WATCH THIS FILM !
neg	Patrick Channing ( Jeff Kober ) is a disciple of Satan / serial killer who possesses the " First Power " : even after being captured by detective Russell Logan ( Lou Diamond Phillips ) and executed in the gas chamber , he is able to move his spirit from body to body and continue to murder at will . With the help of attractive psychic Tess Seaton ( Tracy Griffith , Melanie G. 's half - sister ) he attempts to stop Channing . This concept probably had some possibilities , I think , but ultimately " The First Power " suffers from routine scripting and film - making . This is nothing we have n't seen before , sometimes done better . There is nothing about this movie to distinguish it from other supernatural horror thrillers . More to the point , it 's not very thrilling and it certainly is n't scary . Phillips is a hard sell as a tough - as - nails , cynical cop stereotype , and Griffith does n't seem to be trying very hard ; best cast member is probably the distinctively featured Kober , doing his best to be supremely creepy . The climax is rather silly and the ending very weak . Not really even acceptable enough to rate as an average film of its kind , therefore : 4/10
pos	God ! Zorro has been the the subject of about as many movies as Tarzan , and probably had about as many actors in the title role .   This Serial is one of my own personal favourites , and as previously stated , it is one of the Top 5 Sound Serials . Oddly enough , this is one production that came out in that water shed year of 1939 . * By the time of this production in ' 39 , Zorro was really well known as a ( Pulp ) literary and movie character . The film opens up with a little foot note about the History of the Mexico 's struggle for freedom from rule by a European Monarchy , namely Spain . The story invites comparison with the American Revolutionary War . The story concentrates its attention to the mythical Province of San Mendelito and its ' Council ' . It is being addressed by Benito Juarez**on their gold mine 's relation to the new Republic of Mexico . Gold shipments must get thru to Mexico City . Don Francisco Uncle to Diego Vega , states that he has organized a group of patriots to act as a protective force for the gold convoys . A thug from the Don del Oro mob , stages an ' insult ' to himself and challenges Don Francisco to a duel with swords , Don Frasncisco getting run through . Suddenly the dark clad masked swordsman appears to sword fight and after carving the trademark ' Z ' on the face of the bad guy , he dispatches him to the hereafter . Don Francisco declares with his dying breath to his ward Ramon ( William Corson ) that Zorro is his nephew from the city of Los Angeles . He also attempts to tell of the true identity of Don del Oro , but expires before completing statement . There is a big reception for Diego at Don Francisco 's Hacienda , where Diego disappoints Ramon'sister ( also ward of Don Francisco ) with his timid act . " A FOP ! ! " , she declares . Later , Diego and Ramon slip away to join up with a meeting of the volunteers . When they ask , " who will lead us with Don Francisco now dead ? " , Ramon declares " Zorro , we are Zorro 's Fighting Legion ! " Well there is a big battle with the Legion , now all clad on gray , with masks and capes , protecting the Gold Train . Then Zorro seems trapped at a man - made avalanche intended for the convoy , when , well , you know cliffhanger end of Chapter One . Wow ! That was a lot of writing for one Chapter , but like most other Serials , the opening one is longer and has a lot of ground to be laid to set up the story line . Let 's just let it suffice to say that there are 11 more good , well made , action filled Chapters following . ZORRO 's FIGHTING LEGION has all of the elements that made for top cliffhanger action . We have an unknown evil leader who is fomenting trouble between different groups . There is a number of suspects as to who was really behind of the mask of ' Don del Oro ' . We had soldiers , renegade Whites , hostile Indians and the Legion . In short , it 's safe to say that there is everything one could want , and then some , in this Serial . And , incidentally , they wisely choose to not have the actors affect any Mexican accents . As to just what is there here that makes ZFL stand out from the rest ? What makes it different or unique ? Well ........ First of all , it has a much more elaborate and exciting musical score playing and underlining the drama and action on the screen . The opening theme even appears in a flamenco guitar rendition at the Cantina in Chapter One . This is probably the only time that such a highly specialized innovation appears in serial sound track . And yet there is one more feature that really sets the Fighting Legion saga out in front from all others . That is , the film not only has a heroic musical theme , but it also sports Lyrics , yes , the Legionairres sing ! We hear them singing in the opening credits and in several Chapters ! It really works well and adds to the feelings we get from the viewing . When the Serial was first shown on our local television ( circa 1955 ) , all of the gang immediately recognized the voice of Reed Hadley as belonging to ' Captain Braddock from RACKET SQUAD , the TV Series . Mr. Hadley had a very distinctive , deep voice . * * * He also handled the role very well . His costume and especially the elongated mask looked very good and was probably very functional . There is a small slip up . A sort of minor anachronism occurs by having Benito Juarez(Carleton Young)addressing the San Mendelito Council , as Juarez was about 18 years old at this time ( 1824 ) and , though he was later perhaps the greatest single figure in Mexico 's History , he surely had n't achieved such prominence yet . His inclusion in story probably was to cash in on the release of Warner Brothers ' JUAREZ that year , which starred Paul Muni in the title role . This is not only my pick as a top 5 sound serial , but also my favourite Zorro film . * We are reminded of the great crop of top flight movies that year , what with GONE WITH THE WIND , MR.SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON , THE CITADEL , JUAREZ , THE WIZARD OF OZ , OF MICE AND MEN , ONE MILLION B.C.,ZENOBIA , WE WANT OUR MUMMY all counted among the output that year . * * Once again , Juarez did not ascend to any national importance until around 1850 , about 25 years later . Also , the political sub - divisions are referred to as ' Provinces ' in the story . In actuality , they are called ' States ' . Just as we are called the United States of America , so too , South of the Border they call their Repubhlic the United States of Mexico . * * * Reed Hadley was prominent in some very ' A ' pictures in which his richly toned voice is exploited to good effect . Watch & listen for his narration in THE HOUSE ON 92nd STREET ( 1945 ) and GUADALCANAL DIARY ( 1945 ) .
neg	I notice that most of the people who think this film speaks the truth were either not born before the moon landings ( 1969 - 1972 ) , or not old enough to appreciate them . I think it is much easier to question an historic event if you did not live through it . I was a youngster at the time of Apollo , but I was old enough to understand what was going on . The entire world followed the moon landings . Our families gathered around the TV to watch the launch . Newspaper headlines screamed the latest goings - on each day , from launch to landing , from moonwalks to moon liftoff , all the way to splashdown , in a multitude of languages . In school , some classes were cancelled so we could watch the main events on TV . During Apollo 13 the world prayed and held its collective breath as the men limped home to an uncertain fate . You could n't go anywhere without someone asking what the latest was . The world was truly one community .   Now with a buffer of 30-odd years after the fact , it is easy to claim fraud because worldwide enthusiasm and interest has died down . We are left with our history books , and anybody can claim that history is wrong and attempt to " prove " it with a bunch of lies and made - up facts while completely ignoring the preponderance of evidence showing otherwise -- not to mention the proof that dwells in the souls and memories of those who lived through these wonderfully heady and fantastic days .
pos	This little - appreciated movie is one of my favorites . I can watch it over and over . Dreyfus and Braga are masterful , but Raul Julia steals the show ! A tongue - in - cheek , menacingly humorous Gomez Addams , with just the right tone for this irreverent spoof of this oft - told story . Generally untrumpeted and unappreciated , Moon Over Parador allows you to check out of reality and join the fun going on up on the screen . Two thumbs up !
neg	My friend 's mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out , so when she brought home The Convent , a horror movie , i could n't wait to watch it . Given that it 's supposed to be scary but is actually downright hilarious , I can say that in some weird way , I like this movie .   yes , the acting is bad , and yes , it 's the cheapest movie i 've ever seen , but it 's so damn funny ! " WHAT , ARE YOU SMOKING CA - RACK ? ! " i did n't know this movie even was ever released ... i figured it was too bad ...   Yeah , so ... overall the movie is pretty bad ( you got ta admit that much at least ) but I promise you , you will get a good laugh out of it . * this movie kinda sucks but it 's good for a laugh ... especially that guy that holds the ' dagger of despair ' .. THE DAGGER OF DESPAAAAAAIR !
pos	Oh yeah ! Jenna Jameson did it again ! Yeah Baby ! This movie rocks . It was one of the 1st movies i saw of her . And i have to say i feel in love with her , she was great in this move . Her performance was outstanding and what i liked the most was the scenery and the wardrobe it was amazing you can tell that they put a lot into the movie the girls cloth were amazing . I hope this comment helps and u can buy the movie , the storyline is awesome is very unique and i 'm sure u are going to like it . Jenna amazed us once more and no wonder the movie won so many awards . Her make - up and wardrobe is very very sexy and the girls on girls scene is amazing . specially the one where she looks like an angel . It 's a must see and i hope u share my interests
neg	Wow and I thought that any Steven Segal movie was bad . Every time I thought that the movie could n't get worse it proved me wrong . The story was good but the actors could n't carry it off . Also , they made a lot of mistakes on how proper archiological digs are done . For instance you do n't handle artifacts untill they are catologed and accounted for . The biggest crime in casting was the archiologist girl . She is a weak actress and I felt that her acting really made the movie less realistic then it already was . The whole concept of the knights templar being underground all these years seemed pretty stupid to me . I like the idea of how they disappeared and stuff , so that almost seemed depressing . I thought that the characters wern't explained well enough . You did n't find out much background and that made it harder to relate to them .
pos	What an extraordinary crime thriller ! ! My wife and I saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival last week and it was far and away the best movie in an exceptionally strong festival . It 's already my second favourite film of all - time after DR . STRANGELOVE and I was definitely on an emotional high as I walked home and discussed the film with my wife . I do n't want to spoil the plot because thrillers of this calibre are best enjoyed without preconceptions . A synopsis that I 'd feel comfortable sharing is that two brothers , played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke , are planning to rob a jewellery store in Westchester , New York . The film bounces back and forth in time over approximately a two week period of time ( before , during and after the robbery ) , and one key scene is repeated at least three times . Ordinarily , that could disrupt the momentum of a film but that never happens during this masterpiece . The excitement , the tension , and even the quality of the acting only seemed to get better as the film progressed . By the end , I was on the edge of my seat breathlessly waiting to see how it would all wrap up . I know that I 've used a few clichés in this post , but I literally was on the edge of my seat . I should mention that the non - linear storyline is quite easy to follow . This is n't the sort of movie where you 'll overhear audience members asking their friend to explain the plot during the movie . The acting is absolutely brilliant all - around , and I doubt I would have the same admiration for the film if the casting had n't been so perfect . A tiny complaint is that Hoffman and Hawke do n't look like brothers , but that 's a minor quibble that I can easily overlook . Hoffman was at his very best and some of his scenes with Hawke were positively electric . Marisa Tomei ( as Hoffman 's wife ) and Albert Finney ( as the father of Hoffman & Hawke ) are also very good in supporting roles . Even some cameo performances were so impressive that I can still remember every remark , gesture and facial expression by Brian O'Byrne and Michael Shannon  absolute perfection . The robbery scene felt more authentic than any other cinematic robbery scene I 've ever watched , and I had the same feeling of authenticity in most scenes , especially the ones with Hoffman . The music helped to build up the tension throughout the movie , often the same notes played over very effectively . I had the music playing in my head the following day , even as I sat through other films . In addition to my minor complaint at the beginning of this paragraph , there was one plot twist that felt a bit unbelievable ( major spoiler , so I ca n't describe the scene ) . Otherwise , this film is pretty darn close to perfect . There were about a dozen great films at the festival that I would enjoy watching a second time but BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD stands in a league of its own . As an aside , the director Sidney Lumet spoke before the film and he introduced Marisa Tomei and Ethan Hawke onto the stage . Tomei did n't speak and she acted a bit shy so Lumet asked " Can you believe that someone so beautiful could be so camera - shy ? " That comment is quite ironic considering the graphic opening scene ! !
neg	I feel like I 'm the only kid in town who was annoyed by Branagh 's performance . He is a fine actor by most accounts , but he simply could not pull off the Southern accent . I mean , it was deplorable . It was as if he was trying too hard to be a Yank . One of the previous reviewers questioned why U.S. actors were not cast in this film . I second that notion . It 's wonderful when actors / actresses wish to expand their horizons , but it 's another thing to try too hard so that a performance becomes strained . Maybe it was Altman , but he 's a such a great director ... Well , I really do n't want to bash Branagh for his absolutely hideous accent too much . Everybody deserves to screw up here and there . But it is hard to watch something so annoying that you 'd rather choke on a chicken bone or eat a bucket full of crap than sit through The Gingerbread Man .
pos	The British production company Amicus is generally known as the specialist for horror anthologies , and this great omnibus called " The House That Dripped Blood " is doubtlessly the finest Amicus production I 've seen so far ( admittedly , there are quite a few that I have yet to see , though ) . " The House That Dripped Blood " consists of four delightfully macabre tales , all set in the same eerie mansion . These four stories are brought to you in a wonderfully Gothic atmosphere , and with one of the finest ensemble casts imaginable . Peter Cushing , Christopher Lee ( Cushing and Lee are two of my favorite actors ever ) , as well as Denholm Elliott and the ravishing Ingrid Pitt star in this film - so which true Horror fan could possibly afford to miss it ? No one , of course , and the film has much more to offer than just a great cast . " The House That Dripped Blood " revolves around an eerie rural mansion , in which strange things are happening . In four parts , the film tells the tales of four different heirs . The first tale , " Method For Murder " , tells the story of Horror novelist Charles Hyller ( Denholm Elliott ) , who moves into the House with his wife . After moving in , the writer suddenly feels haunted by a maniac of his own creation ... The first segment is a great kickoff to the film . The story is creepy and macabre throughout and the performances are entirelly very good . In the second story , " Waxworks " , retired businessman Phillip Grayson ( Peter Cushing ) moves into the house , and suddenly feels drawn to a mysterious Wax Museum in the nearby town ... The great Peter Cushing once again delivers a sublime performance in this , and the rest of the performances are also very good . The tale is delightfully weird , and the second - best of the film , after the third . The third tale , " Sweets To The Sweet " is by far the creepiest and most brilliant of the four . John Reed ( Christopher Lee ) moves in with his little daughter . The private teacher and nanny Mrs. Norton , whom Mr. Reed has employed to instruct his daughter , is appalled about her employer 's strictness towards his daughter , and is eager to find out what reason the overprotective father 's views on upbringing may have ... This best segment maintains a very creepy atmosphere and a genuinely scary plot . Christopher Lee is , as always , superb in his role . Nyree Dawn Porter is also very good as the nanny , and my special praise goes to then 11-year - old Chloe Franks . This ingenious segment alone makes the film a must - see for every true Horror - fan . In the fourth segment , Horror - actor Paul Henderson ( Jon Pertwee ) moves into the house with his sexy mistress / co - star Carla ( Ingrid Pitt ) . This fourth story is satire , more than it is actually Horror . It is a highly amusing satire , however , and there are many allusions to other Horror films . At one point Henderson indirectly refers to Christopher Lee , who stars in the previous , third segment ... All four segments have a delightfully macabre sense of humor and a great atmosphere . As stated above , the third segment is by far the creepiest and greatest , but the other three are also atmospheric and often macabrely humorous Horror tales that every Horror lover should appreciate . An igenious atmosphere , a macabre sense of humor , genuine eerieness and a brilliant cast make this one a must - see . In Short : " The House That Dripped Blood " is an excellent Horror - omnibus that no lover of British Horror could possibly afford to miss . Highly Recommended !
neg	This film is a very funny film . The violence is bad , the acting is ... Well Dani , stick to singing or screaming or whatever the hell it is you usually do . The random chicks wearing hardly anything is just to catch sexually - frustrated goth lads in . Personally , i think this movie really does suck . The story and characters COULD be very good , if say the directing , the actors and other little nibby things were made better . But the film is just bad , the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it has Danni in it . This film is possibly the worst B - rate film ever . And , believe me that 's hard to achieve , especially when you 're competing with Def by Temptation and over crappy excuses for " serious " horror movies . I 'm not a CoF fan , and so i just see this as another rubbish movie ... A really bad one . If Dani made this as a comedy then , good going him . Very well done . Over than that though , i rate it low , for it 's crappiness . Watch it when you 're in a happy , happy , joy , joy mode so you can laugh at everything or if you 're high on multiple different types of drugs .
pos	When our local TV station first launched , it filled a lot of its schedule with old British programming . " Lock Up Your Daughters ! " was duly aired , and I -- swayed by the opening few seconds of the film -- popped in a blank tape . Best thing I ever did . The actors are beautifully suited to their characters and bring them to delightful life , complete with appropriate accents ( Christopher Plummer 's Foppington will leave you in stitches , as will Hoyden and her family ) . Double entendres abound , plot - line wheels within wheels mix and match the characters , hilarious sight gags lurk in every scene , and risqué comments are made on a regular basis . I showed the film to friends a few years ago and they called the piece " a lost treasure , " as much for the cast as for the story . To this day I can crack up just thinking about the dialog . Should this gem ever find its way to a DVD release , I 'll be at the front of the line .
neg	There are movies that are awful , and there are movies that are so awful they are deemed long - forgotten and unwatchable . Also , lots of violence and bad stuff ( not just cheesy stuff ; you know what I mean ) add to the mix as well . What is the result of bad movies with such raunchy content ? Why , " Final Justice , " of course !   Remember " Mitchell ? " Joe Don Baker was the star of that movie , and that was riffed by Joel and the Bots on " Mystery Science Theater 3000 . " Now this time , with Mike taking Joel 's place on the Satellite of Love ( but with the same bots ) , that trio got to make fun of MST3 K 's second Joe Don Baker movie , " Final Justice . " Of course , much of the naughty stuff that I mentioned was removed for television release , but still , I want to watch that episode ( and " Mitchell " as well ) , because what does Joe Don " hate " the most ? Why , none other than " Mystery Science Theater 3000 ! "   P.S. If you have a Big Lots nearby , check that store for the uncut tape ! LOL That happened to another user !
pos	The story is about Ankush ( Abhay Deol ) - who is professional marriage witness , in short he acts as a witness for couples in marriage registration office - and Megha ( Soha Ali Khan ) who ran away from her home at Nainital to get married to her love interest Dhiraj ( Shayan Munshi ) . The story starts with Megha waiting at the marriage registration office for Dhiraj to show up but for some reason he does not show up . So Ankush comes in the picture here , who had approached Megha with the intention of earning Rs . 200 for his Witness job and he ends up helping her by providing shelter to her . Ankush grows on his side by working in a bank as an Agent&#8230 ; Ankush falls in love with Megha and she too falls in love with him ( or kind of love ) , both agree for the marriage and Dhiraj comes back in the picture . Unexpected circumstances happen , actually I should say , expected circumstances with unexpected reactions and then&#8230;. Actually the movie story is bit different than the movies we see and I do not think so it will be accepted by the masses but if you are a movie freak like me and love to watch something different , then you will definitely like the movie . The movie is just an innocent love story drafted very well by the characters of Abhay Deol and Soha Ali Khan . The characters are so natural that you feel as if things are happening to the guy next door . The background music of the film also plays a very good role , it is just too good . The way Delhi is shown is very good and gives a fresh feeling . so let 's cut it out and sum it up . Story : A very common story carried very well and transformed to a wonderful experience . Music : Well , as it was Himesh Reshammiya creation , so I did not expect much but still I liked couple of songs of the movie including the Qawwali . Acting : Abhay Deol was the most impressive , very natural and innocent acting but he should stay away from singing in the songs . Soha Ali Khan , she is a doll , a very cute doll I must say . Again very innocent and natural acting and these both actors perfectly fit into their characters . Apart from these two , Shayan Munshi needs some acting lessons and may be few layers of fat to cover the bones . Other actors did their job well . Stars : I would also give it 3.5 stars out of 5 . You will enjoy the movie if watched in the theatre , I would recommend watching it in theatre if you are a movie freak and accept uncommon stories . Otherwise wait for the DVD to arrive . The movie will definitely wo n't be liked by the masses and the business it can do is from word of mouth publicity .
neg	Well , there you have it , another disillusion on my account . Two , actually ! First of all , even though I like to think of myself that I know a little something about 70 's euro - exploitation and its most prolific contributors , I never heard about Joseph W. Sarno before . Here 's a guy who made over seventy rancid and cult - laden exploitation movies and I have n't seen a single one ! How ? Why ? What happened here ? Secondly , and even worse , just when you think to have found a new source for obscure cult movies , that director 's most famous and supposed " masterpiece " turns out to be an irredeemably dull and irritating film . Admittedly , lesbian vampire movies form a pretty insignificant sub genre as a whole , but some of them bath in ominous atmosphere and curious sensuality ( like José Larraz ' " Vampyres " or Harry Kümmel 's " Daughters of Darkness " ) . Joseph Sarno 's film has nothing to offer , except copious amounts of gratuitous nudity and even that becomes boring rather quickly . The events take place in a secluded old castle , hidden deep in the German mountains , where five centuries ago lived a malicious and bloodthirsty ( literally ) baroness . Her loyal disciples still throw naked dance parties in the castle 's catacombs , which are lit by penis - shaped candles  AUCH , and hope to resurrect the baroness any time soon now . Suddenly ( do n't even ask how ) the castle is full of young and sexy female guests , so even more erotic rites ensue . Sounds delicious and entertaining enough , but " The Devil 's Plaything " contains a massive number of sequences where literally nothing happens and where the cast members ' ignorant facial expressions are simply unendurable ! Sarno is n't capable of creating suspense or building a Gothic atmosphere ( or maybe he just did n't bother to ) and the actresses ' capacities restrict themselves to standing in front the camera topless and pull a really pathetic face . Please do yourself a favor : no matter how desperately you strive to see all lurid lesbian - vampire movies of the 70 's , this one is n't worth a penny ! Even the repertoires of Jess Franco and Jean Rollin are pure art compared to this dud .
pos	This film has a lot of raw potential . The script is sharp , the dialogue is ( usually ) excellent ( though it could stand to lose the cheezy voice - overs ) , the direction and cinematography is surprisingly quite good , though some of the experimentation just does n't work . The main problem here is David Duchovny . Once a geek - boy , always a geek - boy ; and the sad , simple fact is that he 's incapable of playing anything but Fox Mulder . He postures , he tries to be slick , he poses , he tries to be macho . In the end he just tries too hard . He overplays his character , he overspeaks his lines , and he 's just outplayed in all ways by Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie , who are each in a class above him in terms of acting skill . Timothy Hutton was ( as always ) really good . There was a spotty moment or two where he over - dramatized his role , but you could tell he was having fun with it . He looked the part , and he became the character both physically and atmospherically . Angelina Jolie was also really good . She did n't have much of a role ; in fact , I though she could have used a much stronger one ... her character was n't nearly developed enough , though she did remarkably well with what she had . And the chemistry between her and Hutton was apparent ( gee , maybe that 's why Uma left him ... ; ) All in all , it was rough around the edges , but a solid effort by a good cast and great supporting roles . If David Duchovny had n't ripped his role to pieces it would 've been * that * much better . 7/10 .
neg	i love horror films , low budget , 50 's , 60 's , 70 's , 80 's .. but how can anyone think this is a very good horror film ? let 's compare it to titles in a similar vein- haunted house films . the haunting , the changeling , the shining . or for a similar technology based horror film that was FAAAR better , ( though still FAR from great ) Demon Seed . OK , i 'll be fair .. let 's compare it to made - for - TV horror films ! do n't go to sleep .. waaay creepier and better done . salem 's lot , the night stalker , night gallery , even do n't go in the basement or crowhaven farm were far better . * SPOILERS * first of all , for as good a scene as the bloody shower scene was , you have a scene like the opening scene .. oh boy ! the garden hose comes alive to hose down some frisky teenagers ! TERRIBLE . also , just what we understand about the house .. it apparently needs to use its video cameras to see what is going on , and it 's a very emotional house . not a spirit , or demon , or entity , it 's a house that s " possessed " , but by what ? we are led to believe an inanimate object learned to love suzie / margaret , our protagonist ? now that I 'm on the topic of suzie .. another scene that totally bothered me , this poor old crazy lady comes , tells you she was your nurse , pours her heart out , falls in the boiling pool , struggling in agony for 45 seconds , and what does margaret do ? does she risk her hands being burnt to save this poor elderly woman that came there to warn her 's life ? no , she stands there and watches ! the acting for the most part was better than average for a horror film , but that 's where the positives end . for at least a more interesting , and fun horror film about an inanimate object that kills people watch death bed : the bed that eats . i have a feeling the people who rated this so highly either have n't watched it since it originally aired , or remembered it scaring them as children . this film was pretty much merit less .
pos	This movie had it all , action , comedy , heroics , and best of all some of the finest actors . Gunga Din will remain a classic to be enjoyed by all who like good movies . Excellent picture , i have it in my collection .
neg	THE NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE ( Emilio Miraglia - Italy 1971 ) . I only watched this delirious piece of Euro - tosh in the way of Alpha Video 's dreadful DVD - release ( looks like an extremely bad video - transfer ) , but from what I saw , not nearly interesting enough to purchase No Shame 's recent DVD - release . Considering their excellent track record , it will undoubtedly be a major improvement over all previous releases . And do n't pay attention to the ridiculous cover shown here , it 's not taken from this film ( some girl holding the head of a Jim Carrey look - a - like ) . Spaghetti Western star Anthony Steffen sports a hip hairdo and assumes the role of Lord Alan Cunningham , a man haunted by the memory of his dead wife Evelyn . This leads to a nervous breakdown which has him being retained in a psychiatric clinic . Once released , Cunningham channels this trauma by taking redheaded prostitutes to his countryside castle , subjecting them to vicious acts of torture . His doctor and friend , Richard Timberlane ( what do you mean , Italian horror names sound " made up ? " ) , advises him to forget the past and remarry but Cunningham is obsessed with Evelyn and even organizes a séance at the castle . Eventually , after killing some more girls , he meets Gladys , another redhead , and marries her almost immediately , but the arrival of his new wife spawns a series of sinister events . Bloodthirsty creatures strike at Sir Alan 's family , killing them off one by one . Becoming more distraught , Cunningham visits Evelyn 's tomb and discovers it to be empty . Soon , a number of " outsiders " begin to suspect something fishy is going on in the castle and Lord Cunningham 's treatment might not have been that successful after all . Director Emilio Miraglia tries to blend Gothic horror with Giallo conventions with limited success . As usual , not the slightest effort was made to convince audiences the film is set in England . The cars drive on the right side of the road , everyone looks very Mediterranean and the castle ( and the rest of the architecture ) is patently Italian . This is common practice in Italian horror , but sometimes they just take this a little too far . The bad print made this even slightly bearable , since it 's so dark , you could n't see much of the surroundings anyway . But , then again , this is the kind of film where anything can happen in the name of exploitation and depicting reality is n't really the issue . A large part consists of sado - masochistic torture scenes in the castle torture chamber , but most of the time , Anthony Steffen hams his way through this and shows some horrible over - acting . I guess it all depends on your state of mind and this can be a fun piece of nonsense if you 're in the right mood . I just could n't take it , at least not with the print I watched . A pleasant score though by Bruno Nicolai which combines easy - listening tunes with some psychedelic rock numbers . Camera Obscura --- 4/10
pos	The film version of Alice Walker 's hugely emotive and influential 1983 novel ( written largely as letters from the central character Celie to God ) was a massive Oscar success , and rightly so . In the role of the abused and awakened Celie , Whoopi Goldberg gave her best screen performance by miles . Not far behind her was Oprah Winfrey as Sofia , the fiery woman tamed by fate . Others in the cast fleshed out the characters Walker had introduced so clearly on the page - Danny Glover as Albert , Celie 's abusive husband ; Margaret Avery as Shug , a force of change for the good ; Willard Pugh and Rae Dawn Chong as Harpo and Squeak ; Susan Beaubian as Corrine , the preacher 's wife ; and the much - missed Carl Anderson ( otherwise best known as Judas in the 1973 film of Jesus Christ Superstar ) as preacher Samuel . Beautifully paced and sensitively written , ' The Color Purple ' does justice to its source while opening out the story to involve viewers of a feature - length drama .
neg	I had to watch this in school . And to sum it up ... Talentless actors , talentless script , and a talentless director . This movie is such a waste of your time . Do n't even watch the movie . Do n't bother . You will be so disappointed . My teacher said it was supposed to be good . How wrong she was . She even slept through it a little . The movie 's actors were just bad . The best actor in there was the old man and that 's not saying much . It 's has horrible plot with awful characters . So unrealistic and I can honestly said it had no point . The script was unemotional and confusing . There was points in the movie when I furrowed my brows and said , " What ? " . Also there were just too many loose ties and plot holes . It was just absolutely horrendous .
pos	And look how a true story , " ... with a little help of it 's friends ... " : a welldone and touching script , a good directing and a surprising great acting from a bunch of " no - name " actors , especially from the 4-yr - old Jodelle Ferland , becomes a must seen movie . 9/10
neg	After having red the overwhelming reviews this film got in my country , I but wanted to see it . But - what a disappointment ! To see a bunch of one - dimensional characters in a plot that lacks of originality is not worth the money and the time to spend . I sometimes wonder about the filmcritics in switzerland .
pos	There have been far too few mainstream films set in post - colonial Africa , and the ones that have are a mixed bunch . This one , with its altruistic pretensions to expose slavery in the 1970s , shows the best and worst values of Africa , which turn out not to be too different to the values of humanity as a whole . It also has shortcomings , given the undue influence of western pre - conceptions of Africans and , especially , Arabs . Dr Anansa Linderby , the beautiful African - American wife of the English doctor David Linderby , is captured by Arab slave - traders , along with a teenage Sanufu girl and a young boy . The lead slave - trader , Suleiman , is every bit the stage Arab , with his flowery and sometimes humorous rhetoric , and gestures to match - which would not be out of place on " Carry On Follow that Camel " but are not up the standard this film deserves . Peter Ustinov of course had more than enough skills to address some of the shortcomings of the script , and he rescued what could otherwise have been a woeful one - dimensional character . Continuing the stereotypical theme , all three of Suleiman 's Arab employees are unintelligent and one has paedophilic tendencies towards the boy , which thankfully are not portrayed on the screen . One of David 's first ports of call is the local police officer , a stereotypical pompous and incompetent African bureaucrat . David then meets two stereotypical white ex - pats , an Englishman ( Walker , played by Rex Harrison ) and an American ( Sandell , played by William Holden ) . Sandell is a mercenary with " conventional " views on mixed - race relationships , who initially refuses to help unless David provides payment up front . Won over by David 's love for Anansa , and conscious of his own inability to find love , he agrees to take David up in his helicopter to help search for Anansa . They find Suleiman and his captives crossing the border and are unable to pursue them into the neighbouring territory - as a result of Sandell 's hesitation and David 's lack of experience with firearms , his helicopter is shot down but David survives . We then see David introduced to Malik ( Kabir Bedi ) , an African who has lost his family to Suleiman and is now only driven by vengeance . They find the Sanufu girl with a group of Tuareg and know they are on the right track to find Suleiman . In one of the most heart - rending scenes they kill a party of slave traders only to find that it was not Suleiman 's group , and have no choice but to send their captives to the Tuaregs they met earlier . Later on we discover that the young boy who had been raped is a witch doctor and , in an excellent scene with supernatural overtones , he uses his knowledge to kill one of Suleiman 's henchmen . Anansa on her part - and despite the scepticism of the boy - manages to engineer the demise of Suleiman 's two other employees . By this time Suleiman and his slaves are within days of reaching the slave market . Suleiman , now in no doubt that Anansa is " trouble " , attempts to sell her to an obscenely wealthy Arab prince ( Omar Sharif ) who is corrupt but intelligent . On discovering that Anansa is an American working for the U.N. , the prince rather unwisely decides to carry on with the bargaining without considering the consequences . The scene where the two men haggle is one of the best in the film . At the slave market , the young boy is sold to a middle - aged German paedophile , and we are left to guess whether the boy will still be considered " wunderbar " when his owner is on the receiving end of his witch - doctoring skills . David and Malik finally confront Suleiman and there is a bitter - sweet ending from Malik 's point of view . Ultimately , David and Anansa are re - united , and Malik , whose life is in ruins , can console himself with having seen the task he set himself completed . The overall plot of the film is excellent but it loses marks for its stereotypical portrayal of nearly all the leading characters . Credit must go to all the leading actors for addressing many of the shortcomings of the scripting .
neg	In the small American town of Meadowvale Dr. Anthony Blake ( David Gale , the IMDb listing for this character is wrong it 's definitely Dr. Blake not Dr. Blakely ) is the director and founder of the famed ' Psychological Research Institute ' and also host 's a local T.V. programme called ' Independent Thinkers ' . He uses this T.V. show to hypnotise the viewers and make them commit acts of violence . Dr. Blake has the help of a large brain with an evil face that uses it 's spinal cord as a tail thingy . Usually the brain is just sitting in a tank , eats mice and the odd bad actor , each time it eats someone it gets much bigger . Meanwhile at the local high - school gifted but troublesome teenager Jim Majelewski ( Tom Bresnahan ) has been caught putting Sodium down the toilets . Jim is sent to Dr. Blake at the PRI for help with his attitude and behavioural problems . While there Dr. Blake hooks Jim up to , well something I 'm not actually sure what . This whatever it is , is attached to the brain . At first Jim is able to resist the brain 's mind control . The brain feels that Jim is a threat to itself and it 's plans . Once out of the PRI Jim starts having bizarre hallucinations and crashes his car . Jim makes it to his waitress girlfriend Janet ( Cynthia Preston as Cyndy Preston ) but is handed back to Dr. Blake 's assistant Verna ( George Buza ) soon after by Officer Marks ( Harry Booker ) . The brain wants to kill Jim because he is the only one capable of withstanding it 's mind control techniques , and with ' Independent Thinkers ' going national the brain does n't want anything or anyone to stop it 's evil plan for world domination ! Jim quickly realises that the brain is controlling the entire town and he alone must stop the brain , before it takes over the world ! Directed by Ed Hunt who calls himself Edward Hunt here , the Brain was n't as bad as I thought it was going to be . Do n't get me wrong as it certainly is n't great either . The script by Barry Pearson tries a stab at satire with the brain washing and mind control by T.V. storyline . It moves along at a fair pace and is n't too boring . No explanation is given for the existence of the brain at all , it 's just there and that 's it we have to accept it . The story is a little choppy and never fully explores one single element , there 's the T.V. mind control , the brain itself , Jim being hunted by the police & his misbehaviour and various other little bits and pieces here and there including a bizarre revelation regarding Dr. Blake that is n't explained at all . Production wise this film looks cheap , and probably was cheap . The acting is n't great but I 've seen worse , and what is David Gale doing in this ? In fact this role is similar to Gale 's role in Re - Animator ( 1985 ) even down to his character 's deaths in both films . The brain itself at first sits in a tank and starts to grow whenever it eats someone and by the end it is pretty big . Each stage is just made of rubber . It does n't look particularly good and is n't scary or creepy , just cheap . There 's no blood or gore in it apart from a blink and you 'll miss it decapitation . The nudity is provided by Dr. Blake 's assistant Vivian ( Christine Kossak as Christine Kossack ) before she gets eaten . The brain had a certain entertainment value for me but I would think most people would dislike it . Maybe worth a watch if you can see it on T.V. for free .
pos	I took part in a little mini production of this when I was a bout 8 at school and my mum bought the video for me . I 've loved it ever since ! ! When I was younger , it was the songs and spectacular dance sequences that I enjoyed but since I 've watched it when I got older , I appreciate more the fantastic acting and character portrayal . Oliver Reed and Ron Moody were brilliant . I ca n't imagine anyone else playing Bill Sykes or Fagin . Shani Wallis ' Nancy if the best character for me . She put up with so much for those boys , I think she 's such a strong character and her final scene when ... Well , you know ... Always makes me cry ! Best musical in my opinion of all time . It 's lasted all this time , it will live on for many more years to come ! 11/10 ! !
neg	This movie fails to offer anything new to a genre that has traditionally shown the cross cultural love story underpinned by the politics mid 20th century / pre - WWII India , where the British and their modern ways are bad and the primitive but honest and true Indians are good . Surely such clichéd depictions of the British are rather passé now . Apart from the drama that fuels the second part of the movie the narrative is predictable , the acting is pedestrian and two - dimensional , and the directing obvious and unimaginative . The story really needed to be fleshed out and would certainly have benefited from another half an hour of screen time to give the characters and narrative more depth and give the viewer something to feel some investment in . All in all , rather uninspiring . Oh and Linus Roache just can not do tragedy - going cross - eyed with emotional pain just does n't work for me !
pos	It helps if you understand Czech and can see this in the original language and understand the Czechs obsession with ' The Professionals ' , but if not , ' Jedna ruka netlaska ' is yet another great Czech film . It is funny , dark and extremely enjoyable . The highest compliment I can pay it is that you never know quite what is going to happen next and even keep that feeling well into the second and third viewing . For a small country the Czech Republic has produced an amazing amount of world class film and literature , from Hrabal , Hasek and Kundera to the films of Menzel , Sverak and numerous others . Czech humour by its very nature is dark and often uncompromising , but often with a naive and warm sentiment behind it . This film is just that , it is unkind and deals with the less lovable sides of human beings , but underneath it all there is a beautiful story full of promise , good intent and optimism . I highly recommend this and most other projects Trojan and Machacek are involved in . Enjoy it , it 's a film made for just that reason - anyway , it 's as close as the Czechs will ever come to writing a truly happy ending ...
neg	I 'm in Iraq right now doing a job that gives plenty of time for watching movies . We also have access to plenty of pirated movies , this gem came along with 11 other movies , and this is easily the worst I 've seen in a long time . I 've seen a few other reviews that claim this movie does n't take itself too seriously , but really , I think that 's a cover up for the fact that its horrible . It 's not tongue in cheek , the writers really thought they were improving on the movie Blade . This movie is just one notch above Vampire Assassin , which if you have n't seen , i recommend . At least that movie is so unbelievably bad that you 'll laugh harder than you thought possible . This is right at that cusp of no redeeming qualities what so ever . from the bad acting , to cliché visual ( ie opening credits ) , to the adobe premier special effects . they could n't even get blanks for the guns , which may have to do with where the movie was filmed , but if you 're going to use effects , make them close to accurate . as for the cast , it seems like they just went to a tae bo class and picked up the first not to ugly chick that walked out . Once again , like Ron Hall in Vampire Assassin , do n't let stunt folk act , they ca n't . Also , the comment about this being a " return of old vampire movies" ... no , it 's not . This is exactly what all new vampire movies are about . Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Blade , Underworld , they 're all about some super star fighting the vampires . This is the newest vampire genre , with bad blood , fake screams , and cheesy over acting . obviously anyone who wrote a good review about this is somehow connected to the movie , or friends of the cast . But what do I care , I paid 33 cents for it . Anyway , to wrap this up , someone in their first semester of film school decided to make a movie , I give them credit because it 's better than I could do . Of course I also know I ca n't make movies so I do n't try . I do know how to watch movies though . I work 12 hour nights , 6 days a week , I 've seen several thousand in the year I 've been out here and this was so bad that half way through i was hoping for a mortar attack .
pos	CitizenX(1995 ) is the developing world 's answer to Silence of the Lambs . Where ` Silence ' terrorized our peace of mind , ` Citizen ' exhausts and saddens us instead . This dramatization of the Chikatilo case translates rather well , thanks to a Westernized friendship between two Rostov cops who become equals . CitizenX may also argue against ( ! ) the death penalty far better than Kevin Spacey 's The Life of David Gayle(2002 ) . Humans are Machiavellian mammals , under which lie limbic brains ( lizard - logic ) . Why did two kids , who knew better , stone to death a toddler they kidnapped ? Why do bloodthirsty women yell ` li - lilililililii ' at acts of OBSCENE terrorism ? -My own term for this is ` limbic domination ' , the lizard - logic urge to dominate an ` enemy ' . If you have the words ` enemy'/`vengeance ' in your vocabulary , you 're easily capable of ` limbic domination ' . In WWII - devastated 1980s Rostov ( located at the mouth of the Don river near the Black Sea ) , nothing suppressed Andrei Chikatilo 's urge for ` limbic domination ' from overpowering his layers of civilization . Chikatilo(Jeffrey DeMunn ) 's easy victims were paupers , usually children , who rode the interurban train for fun , since they could n't afford anything else . CitizenX reminds us that the denials of a rampant Soviet bureaucracy cost the lives of 52 such ` lambs ' . Rostov 's serial killer roamed free for almost 7 years AFTER the police arrested and let him go . The politicization of crimefighting is harmful to police forces everywhere . Although policing routinely suffers from corruption all over the world , in the west , vote - grabbing by politicians can set up chronic inter - agency rivalries , stymieing a more coordinated response to crime . In the Soviet Union of CitizenX , however , Viktor Burakov(Stephen Rea ) 's Killer Department was suffering from a repressive bureaucracy . Geoffrey DeMunn plays the psychosexually inadequate Chikatilo with faultless but understated authority -- to the point of complete obscurity . In real life , too , Chikatilo had a lifetime 's experience blending in and evading capture . His pursuer , on the other hand , sticks out as a strange bird , given to unheralded , naive outbursts . Perhaps by design , Stephen Rea gives a very strange performance as forensics chief Burakov . Rea 's Russian accent is impenetrable ; and his Burakov is humourless and sullen , at odds with everyone . So it 's Donald Sutherland who walks away with the picture . Sutherland 's Col . Fetisov , Burakov 's boss , and at first his only supporter , is an overly restrained , patient Militiaman whose dignified carriage bears testimony to decades of bureaucratic machinations . His reawakening as a logic - driven yet still passionate cop becomes the film 's cornerstone idealism . Joss Ackland does another turn as a vicious apparatchik , Secretary of Communist Ideology Bondarchuk , overseeing the investigation . Naturally , he quashed the arrest of the most likely suspect , a Communist , in 1984 , a man carrying rope and a knife in his bag , supposedly going home : Andrei Chikatilo . Soon , he replaced Burakov with another Moscow apparatchik , Detective Gorbunov(John Wood ) , insisting that the investigation now focus on ` known homosexuals ' . The funniest scene of this sad , sad film comes during Bondarchuk 's & Gorbunov 's institutionalized harassment : one stupid cop earnestly reports , ` As I suspected , comrade , it 's fornication . I 've made some drawings'--cue howling laughter . 5yrs after the bodies began piling up , in 1987 , the police finally tried soliciting criminal profiles . The only cooperating Soviet psychiatrist was Dr Aleksandr Bukhanovsky(Max Von Sydow ) , who termed the UNSUB ` CitizenX ' . He later also observed to Fetisov & Burakov that ` ... together you make a wonderful person ' . We concur . The drawn - out pace , spread over a decade , perfectly captures the institutional inertia of Glasnost--`openness'--that was n't . The contrast with Perestroika--`restructuring'--couldn't've been greater for the case . Although Chikatilo was still prowling railway stations , police plans were about to bear fruit . In 1990 , Col . Fetisov was expeditiously promoted to General . His nemesis Bondarchuk disappeared off the scene , allowing the investigation to finally proceed without political interference . Staff , communications , publicity -- suddenly all were available . In just one night of telephoning around , Fetisov got his depressed forensics chief access to the FBI 's Serial Murder Task Force at Quantico , where , Fetisov discovered , staff are regularly rotated off serial murder cases to stave off just such psychological damage to investigators . Fetisov advises his newly promoted forensics chief , now ` Colonel ' Burakov , of all these changes in an avalanche of confession that becomes the movie 's powerhouse watershed scene . Fetisov 's is the most tender apology I 've ever seen on film : ` Privately , I offer my deepest apologies to you and your wife . I hope that someday you can forgive me my ignorance ' , he almost whispers . A HBO production , CitizenX is a film of the highest caliber . Not only do the exteriors look authentically bleak ( shot exclusively in the most run - down parts of otherwise spectacular Budapest ) , but Randy Edelman 's soaring soundtrack is entirely overwhelming -- and frequently our only respite from the bleak brutality . Those who speak Hungarian will recognize the many Hungarian accents and credits . Chikatilo 's actual murders are depicted as bleak , aberrant behaviour born of character flaws and ignorance in an equally bleak world . This makes the murders seem not - entirely - out - of - place -- but of course they were . As President Kennedy reminded us , ` we all cherish the futures of our children ' . CitizenX communicates perfectly that killing is far more grisly and obscene than any vengeance fantasy might imply . Serial rapists rape to dominate ; serial killers kill to dominate . So do some soldiers . Such ` limbic dominators ' make poor humans . WARNING - SPOILER:----------------------------------------------- The real Andrei Chikatilo WAS the world 's most prolific known serial killer . Convicted , he was executed in 1992 in the manner of all Soviet Union death sentences : one shot , in the back of the head . Foolishly , such methods destroy any possibility of studying a deviant brain after death . Conclusion:------------------------------------------------------------ The best outcome is always the prevention of killings , not their prosecution . Executions merely guarantee society 's failure to learn from the complex reality of victims ' deaths when we dispatch even anecdotal evidence of HOW / WHY they died . Nor do killers learn regret if they 're dead . Vengeance does n't unkill victims . Baying for the killer 's blood constitutes nothing better than counter - domination -- once it 's too late . Vengeance on behalf of the grieving is n't justice for the deceased -- it 's appeasement of the living.(10/10 )
neg	What a piece of junk this movie was . The premise was okay , but even in the beginning with crappy effects to blend in a giant with normal sized people ( even the effects in Hercules was better ) I knew this would be bad . But the really awful part of the movie is the dialogs . It 's completely incoherent , silly and stupid . I felt like it had been written by some 9th grader in creative class and gotten a D- . I want to slap Casper van Diem and the other actors for following this movie through . I 've had my share of cheesy and bad movies ( I love the tremors series ) , but this ... I do not recommend it at all . It 's silly and the totally flabbergastingly bad dialogs will make you cringe .
pos	Not as bad a film as i thought it would be . It has a good cast . Nice to see Roger Moore back on screen as well as the use of other British actors . Would like to see more of Olivia D`Abo in future projects . Maybe starring opposite her cousin the sexy Maryam D`Abo . Also a good use of unseen locations such as Luxembourg . Hopefully we will see more UK - European co - productions like this .
neg	There seems to be a surprisingly high number of 8 - 10 star reviews here from people who have never written an IMDb review before or since . Given the very low average rating given to the film by other people , I think you may draw your own conclusions . This is a very bad film . I 'll admit it , I thought the concept was kind of cute , and I was pleased to see the actresses who played Eve and Harmony on Angel getting work , but it did n't take long for the sheer awfulness of this film to make itself known . Acting : The leads seemed competent enough , but everyone else ? Terrible . Plot : Chock full of holes big enough to drive a truck through . Direction : Non - existent . Humour : Did they really think people were going to laugh ? Oh boy . Eye Candy : OK . there were some really beautiful women in this film . Not just the three main female characters , but right across the board . It was as if the producers hoped the scenery would keep male viewers so distracted they would n't notice how terrible everything else was . If so , they failed miserably . In the right hands this could have been cute but darkly funny camp classic . It was n't even close .
pos	Like I said at the top , four stars just are n't enough . It 's one of the best films I 've ever seen in my almost 17 years of life . For the people that do n't really like it or understand it , you must not have a real appreciation for art or you might have a short attention span . Even if I have n't seen all his films yet , I 'd have to say that this is Spielberg at his peak . It 's pretty sad to see that movies as great as " The Color Purple " do n't come along too often 'cause I think all of us are in desperate need of first - class motion picture entertainment in these hard times . Movies like this are more than just movies ; they 're pieces of art that need to be appreciated more . The idea that it was nominated for 11 Oscars ( even Best Picture of the Year ) and did n't get one trophy is a sign of how blind and stupid Hollywood can be sometimes . Spielberg was n't even nominated for Best Director ! It should have swept the Oscars that year . The film clearly shows you how unfair life is for some people . If only movies were still this good ....
neg	As a kid , my friends and I all believed that Gymkata was the most violent , bloody movie ever made . I 'm not sure who started that rumor . It was probably born out of the frustration of 10 year olds who were n't allowed to see it for one reason or other . Years after Gymkata was released , it became a perennial late night cable movie , and as a result , I 've been able to make up for lost time . I must have seen scenes from this dreadful excuse for a film over a dozen times , and I can always spot it from 1 - 2 seconds of screen time . However , aside from the forced coupling of gymnastics and martial arts , the bad dubbing , the stiff dialog , and the outrageously difficult story - line , the film has some things going for it . With all that 's bad about the movie visually , the sound is actually pretty entertaining . Never before has a punch or kick landed with so little force and so much volume ! The canned kung - fu sounds are cheeky , but the slowed and pitched - down music , and the nearly 5 minute slow motion scene are truly weird . The chase through the city of demented , blood - thirsty villagers is n't really tense as much as it is irritating , and there are enough bad wigs and extras who all but look into the camera and wave to make this train - wreck a little fun . Could it be headed for cult - classic status ? Where is MST3 K when we need it ?
pos	I must say , I thought I had seen it all . I am an extremely jaded movie buff . This movie did n't shock me , by any means . I 'm way past that point . But it did take me to certain emotional places I did n't know I could go to . I had no idea I could ever find ( ick ) the idea of beastiality erotic . Never never never . Ever . Ever . But there you go . He did it . I have to give the director credit . He pulled it off . For the first 40 minutes this movie is a TOTAL bore . We start off with some very explicit footage of two horses having sex . After five minutes of this I started wondering if buying this movie was n't a mistake . Then an old guy in a wheelchair talks to some other old guy about two people getting married . Then some nervous guy shaves . Then we see ( briefly ) a hot chick getting it on with a butler ( but this is very brief ) . At this point I was cursing the movie out loud while trying to stay awake . In fact , I fell asleep at about the 40 minute mark and forced myself to finish it the next night . We finally get the good stuff when a girl ( who knows who she is , or who anyone is in this movie ) has a dream about a Victorian - era gal being ravaged by a beast - thing in the forest . The scene goes on for quite some time and is really the meat ( heh - heh ) of the whole deal . It 's beautifully shot , superbly edited , and does deliver the goods . They do try to wrap up the plot at the end and it sort of makes sense but sort of does n't either . Oh well . I would definitely recommend this film . The first 40 minutes made me want to shoot myself ( and my TV ) but the last 50 minutes totally redeems it .
neg	I chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on IMDb . But a lot of people either have really poor taste or someone 's been fixing the score . Either way it was a real disappointment . The movie is exactly as stupid and far fetched as the title would suggest . There really is no reason to give a summary of the plot - but here goes : it felt like someone had been thinking : " Would n't it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane ? And then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff ? ! ? " And that 's about it ! The plot is thin and unoriginal . The snakes are bad CGI ( but it makes sense to cut corners on a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone ! ) . The acting is poor , and all people are unbelievable stereo types . To sum it up : It 's one of the worst movies I 've ever seen - stay away !
pos	Of all the breakdancing / hip - hop films released between 1983 and 1986 , the 1984 film Beat Street is unquestionably the best one . The story follows a DJ , his younger breakdancing brother , a graffiti artist and a wanna - be showbiz promoter through one winter in which they try to break out of the ghetto using their " street " talent . The acting is n't always up to par and the characters are n't fully drawn out , but they are more than compensated for by down - to - earth dialogue , a plausible story , fantastic dancing sequences and a timeless hip - hop sound track . It should be noted this film was shot in the birthplace of breakdancing ( " This ai n't New York , this is the Bronx ! " ) , and features appearances by the fathers of breakdancing , dance troupe Rock Steady Crew and rapper Afrika Bambaata . Rock Steady Crew provide the best scene in the film when they dominate a dance battle at the premiere breakdancing club of the early 80 's , the Roxy . A must see for hip - hop lovers .
neg	This is one seriously disturbed movie . Even Though the boys deserved some of what they got ..... the sadistic gruesome executions were " slightly " over the top . The only character showing some conscience early in the hunt was killed off before he could offer some help to the sad plot . At the beginning of the movie , there looked to be some promise of a mediocre affair , but this was just a ploy to lull the viewers into a false sense of security , before the joy of what was to come .   The only thing that could have saved the movie for me was if Jack Nicholson had jumped out of the bushes and yelled , " and , where is the batman ? " . Kim Basinger could have screamed .   Now that would have been cool !
pos	This timeless proverb reverberates in this movie and in my heart . So many years have I waited to see this eternal story ! I was not ready , perhaps . It is possible that my sensibilities would not have appreciated its power . So I now gratefully welcome it into my soul with gladness . My respect and admiration for PAUL MUNI has been long . His is now a legendary luminescence . But now I have finally discovered the priceless gifts of LUISE RAINER 's splendid talents . Oh , how many faces can speak as did hers ? Some have said that it was wrought from her silent years , and this well might have been but her speech , is eloquent enough when it is given a chance . She amply deserved her Oscar . This movie is in an epic in the most classical proportions . All parts equal , necessary and perfect . Naysayers may walk away if they wish , but they would be shunning a storytelling which stays with one a lifetime . THE GOOD EARTH enriches one in ways that one does not expect . But all will not come from it with the joy that I did . But I can only hope that this film will be remembered for many years . Do not prod me with mere technicalities regarding the race of the principal players . These are expectations of modern times when we are obsessed with utter perfection . But I dare a million score of newer films to tell PEARL BUCK 's story with such poignancy , power , conviction and grace . If any modern artist would dare to re - film this masterpiece , I warn them that they will never come close to the aromatic fragrance which still emanates from the core of this telling . Time will not diminish this effort nor will progress improve upon its greatness .
neg	This movie is once again , one of those movies that someone thinks or tries to make others think that they understood it . Anyone who tries to make any sense of this is a MORON ! My advise would be to take TWO not one but TWO hits of very strong acid and at least you 'll get a visual thrill out of it ! ! Although at the end you may kill yourself for wasting your acid ! ! ! ! Being that this comment requires 10 lines of info , let me write something for those of you that will try to defend the movie . Unintelligble . Garbage . Schitzoid . Waste of talent . Movie is ice , with paper on destination with ringing clouds , on a sunny dive in the pudding .... Sounds like lion in a red light with seeing hair . Now explain that to me ! ! ! !
pos	I was really looking forward too seeing this movie as it has been advertised as a must - see movie for people that love movies about nature . The movie shows different climates and the animals associated with them by starting at the North Pole and going down south as the movie progresses . The footage from this movie is often breathtakingly beautiful and I many times wondered how on Earth they could have taken some of the shots under water or in the sky . However beautiful , a large part of the footage I had already seen in the TV series ' Planet Earth ' , narrated by David Attenborough . I found Attenborough 's narration of Planet Earth to be much better than the narration of Earth . ' Earth ' is an easier movie . It skips much of the scientific detail that Attenborough covers in his ' Planet Earth ' series . For instance , Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is an ideal nursery for a young humpback whale , because there are few predators . Planet Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is a good nursery , because the water is low in oxygen and does n't contain enough nutrients to support very large animals , like large sharks , etc . To me , that 's an important difference . That , together with Attanborough 's far superior voice make Planet Earth a far better documentary than Earth . Still , however , I think Earth is worth watching for the beautiful footage and the fact that it 's easier to understand makes it interesting for children too .
neg	When the movie was released it was the biggest hit and it soon became the Blockbuster . But honestly the movie is a ridiculous watch with a plot which glorifies a loser . The movie has a Tag - line - " Preeti Madhura , Tyaga Amara " which means Love 's Sweet but Sacrifice is Immortal . In the movie the hero of the movie ( Ganesh ) sacrifices his love for the leading lady ( Pooja Gandhi ) even though the two loved each other ! His justification is the meaning of the tag - line . This movie influenced so many young broken hearts that they found this " Loser - like Sacrificial " attitude very thoughtful and hence became the cult movie it is , when they could have moved on with their lives . Ganesh 's acting in the movie is Amateurish , Crass and Childishly stupid . He actually looks funny in a song , ( Onde Ondu Sari ... ) when he 's supposed to look all stylish and cool . His looks do n't help the leading role either . His hair style is badly done in most part of the movie . POOJA GANDHI CANT ACT . Her costumes are horrendous in the movie and very inconsistent .   The good part about the movie is the excellent cinematography and brilliant music by Mano Murthy which are actually the true saving graces of the movie . Also the lyrics by Jayant Kaikini are very well penned . The Director Yograj Bhat has to be lauded picturization the songs in a tasteful manner .   Anyway all - in - all except for the songs , the movie is a very ordinary one ! ! ! ! ! !
pos	This is a brilliant documentary that follows the life of Herge and his creating TinTin . Its based around a series of interviews conducted in 1971 , and covers every thing from his early life and " Nazi collaboration " to the final moments of his life . Brilliantly edited , very cinematic and fast paced enough to not get boring . This film will give you a new appreciation for the work of Herge . The film makers make the film more than just another documentary . Using the latest state of the art technology and for a change putting it to good use . Recently more and more documentaries have been making it to cinemas . But this one as to be amongst the best ...

pos	The story and the characters were some of the best I 've ever seen . the graphics were good for the PS and the cut scenes and voice overs were amazing . I beat the game at least 3 times and loved every second of it . I felt the problems the protagonist faced were believable and realistic and i believe it deserves a sequel . or at least a remake . If they remade it for the ps3 i would buy the system for just that game and maybe mgs4 its amazing also the idea and execution of the dragoon system is enough to warrant a rental and on top of that ad the inventive although sometimes cheating(stupid buster wand ) combat addition system and the plot makes this game a definite buy .
neg	This version moved a little slow for my taste and I suppose I have problems with this play to begin with . But first the movie , it 's a typical TV movie version of a play which means it does n't have the flair of the original film version with William Holden . What they could n't afford to hire more than twelve people as extras ? Why move the movie up to 1966 ? So you could give the little sister a line about the Vietnam war protests ? Why not 1963 and give her a line about the civil rights movement ? As for the casting , some hits some misses . Jay O. Sanders hit the right notes for his character especially with his scenes with Josh Brolin . Brolin on the other hand miss a lot of the notes . He 's believable as an ex - BMOC jock but he does n't have the raw sensuality of William Holden . I always thought Brolin looks a little bit like a gorilla to have all the women in town go ape over him ( pardon the pun ) . Gretchen Moll was lovely but she seemed a little too wise for the character she played . She did n't project the innocence or ignorance that the character required . Maybe it 's because she and Brolin were about 5 years older than the characters should be . But then again Holden was ten years too old . Bonnie Bedelia was rather forgettable as the mother and Mary Steenburgen ca n't seem to make up her mind whether she was playing Blanche duBois or Katharine from " The Taming of The Shrew " . As for Mr. Inge 's play , I always felt that stories like this of a young woman choosing passion over practicality always needed an epilogue . " The Twilight Zone " I believe offer a likely epilogue with the episode , " Spur of the Moment " where a young Diana Hyland was being chased by a bitter older Diana Hyland , because the younger Diana Hyland chose to run off with a guy similar to Hal Carter .
pos	Yesterday , I went alone to the cinema , because here in Mexico , most of the times movies from other countries are part of the so called " camára alternativa " ( alternative camera ) . But after I saw this movie , I realized that not all the foreign movies are alternative . Afortunately , this is a good a example . But I have to said that I enjoyed so much this movie .. that at the end I was happy .. this movie is a little spoon of hope in these days . And the main lesson for me .. is that at the end of the day ... the love is main force behind us . This is a good option to see a good movie in Spanish ... and I have to mention the good music .. specially the main song of the movie .. Cosas que hacen que la vida valga la pena .... Excellent song ! ! !
neg	Could n't believe it ! Clipped sentences ? Good grief ! Know what ? All true ! Real people ever talk like this ? Do n't think so . Good girl ! Stout fellow ! Stiffen upper lip ! Only reason given movie 2 instead of 0 Gary Cooper such a dish . Movie as a whole ridiculous unless you like watching endless biplane dogfights . Seemed endless , anyway . Think all Franchot Tone 's dialogue dubbed . When Crawford and Young make a special effort to sound British they come over as Irish . Handy tip - we Brits clip words , not sentences . And somehow we manage to draaaaaaaawl at the same time . But that 's only if we 've been to a really good public ( that 's private to you ) school .
pos	....... Playing Kaddiddlehopper , Col San Fernando , etc . the man was pretty wide ranging and a scream . I love watching him interact w/ Amanda Blake , or Don Knotts or whomever -- he clearly was having a ball and I think he made it easier on his guests as well -- so long as they Knew ahead of time it was n't a disciplined , 19 take kind of production . Relax and be loose was clearly the name of the game there . He reminds me of guys like Milton Berle , Benny Hill , maybe Jerry Lewis some too . Great timing , ancient gags that kept audiences in stitches for decades , sheer enjoyment about what he was doing . His sad little clown he played was good too -- but in a touching manner . Personally I think he 's great , having just bought a two DVD set of his shows from ' 61 or so , it brings his stuff back in a fond way for me . I can remember seeing him on TV at the end of his run when he was winding up the series in 1971 or so . Check this out if you are a fan or curious . He was a riot .
neg	Do nt let the MPAA fool you with their " Rated R for extreme violence " there is definatly no extreme violence in this boring peice of s*t . I expected some cheap rambo 3 type action that the trailer promised , however its just boring boring nonsense with tons of lame slow mo flashbacks that make no sense . AVOID !
pos	Marie : You are smooth . Dan : No , I 'm not smooth . I 'm Dan . If you 're anything like me , smooth and single do not go together . You see someone you like , rare enough as that can be , and you want to say something but you do n't . Or maybe you do say something but it ends up being perhaps the least intelligent thing you 've ever said in your life . More often then not though , you stare from afar and admire without having to deal with taking that which most agree is the only way to get anywhere in life  a risk . You ca n't blame a guy for being a little frightened though . Maybe he 's been burned hard before or maybe he 's trying to focus all his energy on his career . There are reasons , some valid , some not , and all of them can be interpreted as excuses rather than reason . You tell yourself you do n't need it or it is n't the right time for you but you still wish it were happening . Any way you break it down , it 's not easy . Sound familiar ? If you thought yes even just a little , then DAN IN REAL LIFE , the new comedy from director Peter Hedges , is a must - see . It will reach inside of you and somehow manage to both break and warm your heart all at once . The Dan from the title is Dan Burns ( Steve Carell ) , an advice columnist who is admired for his insight into living a balanced , fulfilling and morally uplifting life . Four years or so before the film opens on Dan waking up to his day , he lost his wife and love of his life . After that tragedy , Dan was left to raise their three daughters alone . Between that and focusing on his career , finding love again was not one of Dan 's priorities . And so he became more functional than feeling . Removed from the power of intimacy , Dan no longer knows what it means to be that close to someone and has resigned himself to never knowing that again . That is , until he meets Marie ( Juliette Binoche ) in a book and tackle shop in Connecticut on a quiet morning . They 're interaction is casual , comfortable and it catches both of them off guard . There is only one problem really . She is already seeing someone . Unfortunately for all involved , that someone is Dan 's brother , Mitch ( Dane Cook ) . His entire family has come up to their parents ' country home for their yearly visit and Dan must now spend the weekend pining and yearning for the fleeting feeling he had with Marie that morning . It only lasted an hour or so but it only took that long to awaken Dan 's heart from its coma . With so many family members to deal with ( Jack Mahoney and Dianne Wiest are at the helm ) , DAN IN REAL LIFE does drift away from its grander purpose from time to time . While the cyclone of kids and parents and aunts and uncles makes for trying times for Dan , Hedges also uses it unnecessarily as a means to distract , with the presumption that it would ultimately make for a more complete film . Luckily , Hedges has got Carell to carry the heavy burden . It is a pleasure to watch Steve Carell come into his own more and more with every picture he makes ( despite the occasional EVAN ALMIGHTY - sized misstep ) . He is charismatic , charming and obviously a sharp humorist . As Dan , he is also self - deprecating , awkward and scared . Carell is the rare comedian who pushes himself to find character in his roles rather than rely solely on his comedic instincts and established persona . Perhaps more importantly , he is entirely relatable as Dan . Whether he 's flopping down on the cot in the laundry room where he is subjected to sleep as the only single adult at this reunion or fidgeting around the kitchen , unable to stan d still in his anxiety , Dan is every guy who has even been unsure of himself and felt alone in the crowd . Carell gives Dan so much heart that he becomes the heart of the film itself at the same time . I wondered after seeing the film if I enjoyed the it as much as I did , despite its slight shortcomings ( Juliette Binoche  I know you might like to lighten up every now and then but I do n't recommend it unless there is chocolate involved ) , because of where I am in my life . Would someone who has found that someone else derive as much meaning and comfort from this film ? I ca n't say . What I can say , as someone who knows what it means to be lonely , DAN IN REAL LIFE knows what it means to be surprised by life and love and how these moments and people need to be appreciated and cherished . It also knows that anyone who might be feeling lonely on any given day or for months at a time needs to be reminded that surprises still happen .
neg	Definitely , definitely the worst film I 've ever seen , no questions asked ! Contradictors of this opinion might argue that this title should not be judged by the same criteria as others , since it 's an independent , low - budget film , but c'mon already  the amateurism and meager innovation is horrifying . Agreeing with everything that has been said about this film , for example the mind numbingly weak acting ( when it 's this bad you take another go at shooting the scene , god damn it ) , the thing I found the most annoying was the total lack of common sense in the script , assuming such a thing existed during the production . There was an obvious absence of a dialogue with respect for the viewers , the girls switched personalities several times and they seemed to show absolutely no sing of any rationality or even brains - five relatively fit girls against one slight female psychopath  gang up on her , why do n't you ? The only thing that can be regarded as somewhat of a conquest for this title is the camera not leaving the van at any time thus the viewer seeing everything from inside it - which is , as the rest of the film , a good idea executed exponentially dreadfully .  oh and by the way , this movie is NOTHING like The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield or any other title filmed with a hand - held camera  this is an effect and not a trait ! Used cleverly it can be breathtaking , but in this case it 's an excuse for inadequate cinematography .
pos	This is a very funny movie , easy to watch , that entertains you almost all the time . The work of the Director is recognizable and the type of humor is his trademark . The movie is a typical police partners history like lethal weapon , but the jokes and comedy are of Argentinian sort . The twist is that one of them is a psychologist played by Peretti and has to go with detective Diaz ( played by Luque ) on his assignments while he also assist him ( Diaz is troubled because his wife cheated on him ) . Some of the dialogs are hilarious worldwide : understandable and laughable anywhere . Is very good overall , it would deserved an 8 , but I rated 7 because it gets a little down at the end . On a personal remark I must add that is a " bravo " for Argentinian Filmmakers , considering the little good is coming lately .
neg	The Ballad of Django is a meandering mess of a movie ! This spaghetti western is simply a collection of scenes from other ( and much better ! ) films supposedly tied together by " Django " telling how he brought in different outlaws . Hunt Powers ( John Cameron ) brings nothing to the role of Django . Skip this one unless you just HAVE to have every Django movie made and even THAT may not be a good enough excuse to see this one ! !
pos	No awards show can please all the people . Clearly if your favorite movies did n't win , you will say the show was n't very good . That 's understandable . However , the 74th Annual Academy Awards will be remembered for one magical moment of Hollywood history : Woody Allen 's first appearance ever at the Academy Awards . Allen has often shunned the awards as being self - aggrandizing and pointless , and has never attended -- even though he has won several of the coveted awards . When the 74th Academy Awards were held , the nation was still mourning the loss of life in the collapse of the World Trade Centers in New York . When it came time to pay tribute to the city of New York , they decided to show a video of the great movie moments form the city of cities . Then the announcer simply said : " Ladies and gentleman , Oscar Award winning Director Woody Allen . " The place erupted in an extremely long standing ovation . The entertainment industry finally got to give their applause to the Man from New York who usually avoids the Hollywood scene . As the applause died down , Woody applied some of his legendary wit to the situation . SOME HIGHLIGHTS : " Thank you very much - that makes up for the strip search . " " I thought they wanted their Oscars back , " he joked . " I panicked because the pawn shop has been out of business for ages and I had no way of retrieving anything . " " But that was n't it . I could n't work it out because my movie was n't nominated for anything this year . Then it hit me - maybe they were calling to apologise . " Allen also disclosed why he had overlooked his lifelong Oscar - aversion for this one special night . " For New York City , I 'd do anything . So I got my tux on and came down here , " said Allen . " It 's a great , great movie town . It 's been a great , moving and exciting backdrop for movies and it remains a great , great city . "
neg	Thomas Archer ( Ron Eldard ) has his child killed and his wife viciously attacked in a home invasion . Dr. Heller ( Christopher Plummer ) tries to help him through the post traumatic stress . Then Archer finds himself confronted with a man ( Til Schweiger ) bound and gagged to a chair . He is told this is the man who killed his child and attacked his wife and he can do whatever he likes to him . And there 's a large assortment of instruments there to help him ... Film is interesting at first ( and shows real restraint in terms of blood and gore ) but gets stupider by the minute and has some highly unlikely plot twists and turns . It all ends in a final twist that was so old and stupid that I was shocked anyone would actually think of using it anymore . How such talented actors like Eldard , Schweiger and Plummer got involved in crap like this is beyond me . This gets three stars for the acting but the stupid plot and truly unbelievable twists make this a chore to sit through .
pos	As a grownup in my mid-40s , I am not even close to any of " Nancy Drew " 's key demographics , but I was pleasantly surprised by the film this afternoon ; so , I could tell , were the pair of sixtyish silver - haired ladies down the row from me . The older man who left the theater just ahead of me specifically praised the film to the 20-ish female usher ( who said she 'd seen the film the previous evening and quite liked it ) . More to the point , however : In the row just ahead of me , there were nine -- count them , nine -- ten - year - old girls lined up next to each other , passing popcorn and hot dogs and candy back and forth and giggling through the previews . Once the film began , they promptly settled down to watch .... .... and did n't so much as peep till the closing credits began to roll . This is not a perfect film ; it does n't quite pay off its high school subplots , it 's not quite confident enough of its own tone , and its thugs are just a hair too far over toward critically inept at times . But the adaptation of the source material is essentially respectful , the plot hangs together fairly well , and it treads deftly between the sins of excessive cheesiness and excessive modernization . Last but not least , Emma Roberts carries the movie with startling grace -- Josh Flitter 's superb timing notwithstanding , this is Roberts ' movie , and she pulls it off beautifully . Her Nancy Drew is very much the direct ancestor of Kristen Bell 's Veronica Mars , and the film is also a lineal descendant of Jodie Foster 's early and underrated " Candleshoe " . In today 's marketplace , it 's a rarity : a family movie that respects its viewers ' intelligence . As such , it wo n't be to everyone 's taste -- but for what it is , it is the best movie of its kind in decades .
neg	In my book " Basic Instinct " was a perfect film . It had outstanding acting on the parts of Stone , Douglas and all the supporting actors to the tiniest role . It had marvelous photography , music and the noirest noir script ever . All of it adding up to a film that is as good as it will ever get ! This sequel is the exact opposite , it can not possibly get worse , bad acting and a lame script , combined with totally inept direction , this is really bad , boring , annoying . The only thing that somewhat keeps you concentrated is the relatively short wait for the next scene that is an exact re - enacted copy of the original . These copies are so bad they make you laugh and I laughed a lot in spite of myself , because it was like watching the demolishing of a shining monument . The only thing that is good in this horrible mess are the excerpts of the Jerry Goldsmith score of BI1 . Michael Caton - Jones and the half - wit responsible for the script even included the " There is no smoking in this room " dialog in the interrogation scene and yes she sends her attorney ( who is now a solicitor ) away !   I am sorry I have seen this awful film that should have never been made ! It does damage to the original , so bad is it . The only redeeming value is the realization that cosmetic surgery ( and I am sure Ms Stone afforded the best surgeon money can buy ) can do a good job but can obviously not restore the perfection of the original . And what concerns the human body applies to film - making , too . There should be a law : Do n't ever make a sequel to a perfect film !
pos	While in a plane , flicking through the large choice of movies , I came across Live ! almost accidentally . oh boy ! what a choice . I remembered vaguely seeing the trailer over a year ago and completely forgot about it expecting no more than another cheesy nonsense movie about a stupid reality show . Now I can easily say this has been a hell of a ride . I do n't remember last time I have been so excited , terrified . Not sure if it was the high altitude playing with my senses , but the suspense grow gradually through the movie until reaching a climax where you ca n't turn away from the screen , literally sitting on the edge of your seat and biting the remaining nails you 've got . You will first go through a personal moral assessment of where you stand about the righteousness of the show . You will drift from thinking " how come the human being can be so vicious " to " why not after all?".Ask yourself would you do it . Then learn about the contestants , their motives and start guessing . You will then watch contestant pulling the trigger one by one and get excited even though you know the first candidate is safe . Good acting , good directing , with a movie experience that reminds you those old movies where you knew what would happen in the next scene but still were craving for more . * Spoilers * couple of things i would have changed : - the casting of the contestants . i have really been moved by the farmer and we should have had a bit more like him . The idea of a rich writer who wants to be famous is a bit stupid , it felt like you did n't care about some of the contestants . Although this might have been done on purpose , i think the audience should have been able to associate with the majority of the contestants . - game rules , a big glitch : what happens if the 5th contestants does n't die when he pulls the trigger . do you seriously think the last standing guy will pull the trigger and execute himself ! ! ! they should have given a chance to all contestants to live , ie : if 5th is a blank too , then no one dies . interestingly I have n't been bothered too much by this bad points cause i really had a good time . just wish i had some popcorn with me !
neg	The second half of Steven Soderbergh 's revolutionary bio on Che Guevara deals with his last campaign to export revolution to Bolivia . In order to maintain his saintly visage of Che Soderbergh conveniently leap frogs the mass executions he presided over after the revolution in Cuba and the folly of his Congo adventure ( " This is the history of a failure " he writes in the preface of his Congo Journal ) to concentrate fully on Che 's attempt to rally support to rise up against the government in Bolivia . It would turn out to be a disaster and Guevara 's final act . What plagued the first chapter follows suit here as Soderbergh slows his film to a crawl to study the beatific countenance of the contemplative Guevara once again being played like James Dean in East of Eden by Bernicio Del Toro . The problem is Guevara has little success in gaining converts and he soon finds himself and his starving comrades being swallowed up in the heart of darkness Bolivian Jungle . Unlike Werner Herzog in the magnificent , Aguirre , the Wrath of God Soderbergh fails to utilize the jungle 's metaphorical possibilities to heighten the desperation of the guerrillas . He seems more concerned with keeping Che 's nimbus above his head than exploring the panic setting in on the dead enders . There is one Herzogian moment where Che sits astride an obstinate horse kicking and screaming to get it moving but overall Soderbergh 's mise en scene remains flat , sloppy and uninteresting .   In both of his films Soderbergh shows he is clearly a Che groupie and because of it his focus remains myopic and narrow . He spends too much time building his monument to Che and too little in developing his relationships with key players in his saga , especially Fidel Castro . Making matters worse he does it with a slow and dispassionate approach that never catches fire . One would think he was steeped in enough Eisenstein and Vertov to realize that sweeping change is showcased a lot better with sweeping style .
pos	The movie may be great . I just watched it last night , but feel unable to give an honest opinion of it because I read the book first . The book is so much better than the movie that I was disappointed with the film . If you plan to watch " Of Human Bondage , " do n't read the book beforehand . On the other hand , the book is so good , and contains so much more than the love affair Phillip has with Mildred , you could still enjoy it after seeing the movie . I do not make this claim lightly . I average reading a book every 4 days , and read such disparate authors as Danielle Steel , Ovid , Faulkner , Plato , and Shakespeare . " Of Human Bondage " gets my vote as one of the top ten novels ever written .
neg	I saw this film over the weekend and while I was impressed as always with the beauty and polish of Church - produced films , I left disappointed that this one fell so short , failing to inform members and leaving investigators with many unanswered questions . The film is 70 minutes of vignettes from the life of Joseph Smith . It 's not a true biopic because there 's no real coherent narrative . Most of the episodes concern Joseph doing good deeds , playing baseball , running races and laughing with children , often in sloooow motion . What a great , just folks kind of guy that Joseph was , huh ? Look at him out there beating rugs for his wife Emma . Well , howzbout the rugs of his 33 plural wives ? ? No mention whatsoever is made of polygamy . A glaring omission . And it is in such omissions where the film falters . It supplies too little information and leaves critical thinking audience members wondering WHY is Joseph getting tarred and feathered , WHY is he getting thrown in jail and WHY does that mob want to kill him ? The film 's climax is of course Joseph and Hyrum 's trek to Carthage jail ( riding past a veritable United Nations of faces looking out from Nauvoo 's doorways ) . But no mention is ever made about WHY . Nothing about Smith suppressing the Nauvoo Expositor newspaper and ordering its press destroyed for its revealing the secret teaching of polygamy . The audience is left to wonder or to assume it 's just more baseless persecution of the Church . No mention of Joseph being charged with treason for declaring martial law and calling out the Nauvoo militia . Of course I certainly did not expect this Church - produced film to present the Joseph of Richard Bushman 's recent biography Rough Stone Rolling , but I was surprised and taken aback at just how little of substance was actually presented . And worse , what substance that was presented was often inaccurate . Two examples jumped out at me . First , the translation of the Book of Mormon . The film shows Joseph reading right off the golden plates in their two - ring binder , which plates in reality were hidden far from the site . It 's well known that Joseph did his translating by burying his face in his hat , peering at the seer stone in there . The second inaccuracy occurs at Carthage jail , where the mob storms the cell . The History of the Church reports that Joseph had a six - shooter and even fired off a few rounds before jumping out the window and giving the Masonic signal of distress ( as reported in Times & Seasons ) . Maybe showing the reality of the gunfight would have shattered the heart - tugging mood the filmmakers had created , but by omitting it they were unfaithful to history and failed to show Joseph as he really was : handy with a gun and able to defend himself . In fact , the impression the film gives is that Joseph was a nice guy , but also something of a milquetoast that everybody beat up , tossed in jail and eventually murdered in cold blood . He was far from that ; Joseph was a disciplined and determined man who endured a lot of hardship and struggle to bring to fruition that in which he believed . See the film , but know going in that 's it 's cotton candy . Then get your meat and potatoes by reading a copy of Bushman 's biography of Smith , Rough Stone Rolling   PS : Church - produced films have no credits , but seasoned eyes can pick out a couple familiar faces . Rick Macy is excellent as Joseph Smith , Sr . and Bruce Newbold , beloved as Thomas in Finding Faith in Christ , here plays the cranky Methodist minister who failed to show Christian love to a young seeker after Truth .
pos	You 've never seen anything like it . Once the coup begins , it 's the most dazzling , edge - of - your - seat thriller you 'll ever see -- even though you know the outcome . And it 's all real , because it 's a documentary -- amazing .   By the time it was over , it was on my Top 10 list of All Time Great Movies . Disregard the slobbering right - wing fanatics . Everyone I know who has seen this film gives it the 4-star rating . Even if you do n't care about politics or about Venezuelan politics , you will find yourself nerve - racked and -- believe it -- on the edge of your seat . It 's a roller - coaster ride .
neg	Going down as the most expensive film in Finnish history , to date , " Dark Floors " is a horror film with an extremely Lynchian narrative that recounts an ever increasingly decrepit series of " Floors " ( ironically enough ) in an abandoned hospital , in which our protagonists are trapped . Lead by an autistic daughter and her father , himself disenchanted with the hospitals apparent lack of medical progress with his daughter , make their way into an elevator debating the issue with one of the hospitals nurses . Accompanied by a security guard , a businessman and a seemingly intoxicated tramp the collective soon find the complex abandoned , but they are not alone . Directed by Finnish- born Pete Riski , more known for his television work , " Dark Floors " is filmed in English , using mainly English actors but has the notable inclusion of Finland 's arguably most famous group " Lordi " ( 2006 Eurovision song contest winners ) as themselves , i.e. in their on stage monstrous costumes , as the films antagonists , yet for all this razzmatazz the production fails where it is needed most , in convincing the audience . Any film that has their lead character use the phrase " it 's too quiet " is already headed down a dubious path , and this Lordi influenced horror does not break that convention . For all the good ideas that are thrown into the mix there are a handful of ripe clichés alongside and worst of all , anything that is interestingly original is n't fleshed out enough for it to resonate . The concept of the degrading floors is initially highly ominous and does provide a sense of inevitable doom as the audience is aware those trapped in the hospital must progress ever further down in the mire . However , there is n't enough atmosphere created to scare and intimidate the audiences into the unknowing fear , the viewer is aware the journey will become ever more dangerous , as the levels degenerate from shiny white through to hellish black , but I do n't think the characters are aware enough of this fact for it to be threatening . Also , the entire film taking place in what is essentially its own time bubble is again a very nice touch , a concept not often used in the horror genre , but the characters do n't confront the situation with enough fear and trepidation when they stumble across this fact , they continue about their business far too readily and without enough genuine concern for the idea to mean anything to the audience . These initially good ideas are just left to go to waste , as if the director and/or Mr Lordi ( who had many of the ideas used within the film ) had these thoughts , but could n't agree or decide on how to best use them and as such lose their purpose and point .   Yet for all the frustration there are large quantities of comedy , yet not for the reasons the creators would have hoped for . Too much is clichéd , too much is recycled and too much is just simply ridiculous . While the lead is amicably acted by Noah Huntley , the characters are mere cardboard cut outs that have been pasted into the story from other films . We have a lead man doing everything possible to protect his daughter alongside a clunkily developed love interest . Accompanying the " couple " we have the traditional token black man as a hard - nosed security guard , with the nigh on infinite clip for his sidearm , and a weasely disbelieving businessman only on the look out for himself . Worst of all though , unfortunately , is the introduction of the cast of Lordi as the creatures of the night that torment our wandering band of misfits , but not for them appearing as themselves . What makes a horror film scary to the viewing audience is contextualising the fear . " The Shining " is scary because it 's a member of your own family hounding you , in " Dawn Of The Dead " it 's our fear of each other and the primordial cannibalism and irrational thought patterns the zombies possess , in " Alien " the fear is explained , the creature is rationalised and in " Dark Floors " there is none of that . Perhaps it 's unfair to compare this production to these monoliths of the genre but when you do it shows it pales significantly and that it 's aggressors feel like nothing more than demented Klingons where you can almost see the zip on the costumes they wear , without a build up of any atmosphere " Lordi " just are n't scary . It 's infuriating because we all cheer for the underdog and hope they do well , you want the smaller productions to say that they can create the same quality of film as " Hollywood " churns out , much in the similar way that George A Romero started out , but it does n't always materialise . I enjoyed the film and did n't feel as if I had wasted the ninety minutes I had just sat through , but I felt enjoyment on a completely hollow level as if nothing that had occurred mattered or affected me subconsciously , emotionally or critically . I felt the almost Lynchian narrative was a standout plus point , but it fades out into nothingness . Why did it happen ? What does it mean ? Will they go through this all again ? Without even the slightest insight into what will happen the film is simply puzzling for the sake of trying to be arty . Was the entire sequence of events real or was it merely a dream sequence ? Had the autistic girl watched the Eurovision Song Contest of 2006 and simply had a highly bizarre nightmare given the stress she was under ? Who knows ? And unfortunately I fail to work up the energy to even care . " Dark Floors " is an infuriating experience that while ultimately shallow hallmarks potential and at the very least shows a plethora of creative energies from Mr Lordi , who perhaps should look into working solo to fully develop his ideas . It 's one that fans of the group or the genre should perhaps pursue but will leave you feeling left in the lurch for not having enough light shed on the situation .
pos	This is one of the best movies out there and that 's saying a lot being that it was for television . I really wish it was on d.v.d . Helen Hunt gave such a raw performance . She played a rookie cop thrown into serial killer case perfectly . When she falls apart because he kills another kid it was amazing . She is so alone , so he gets to her . When she talks about her mother ! WOW ! Steven Weber as the serial killer was so shocking ! He really brought her into his dark world . It was Oscar - worthy . When he talks about killing the kids , scary ! When he realizes who she really is ! What a scene ! ! They really do n't make them like that anymore . It was a real thriller without being gory .
neg	I figured that it 's about time I let this one out . Pokémon fans are suffering in America these days . Why ? Because we rely on Kids WB and 4Kids Entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies . As far as the series goes , they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the Japanese versions to television . So what is their problem when it comes to the movies ? Honestly now , I have seen all three Pokémon movies in Japanese and I will definitely be seeing the fourth one . They are excellent movies . They are all enjoyable and fun to watch . And , after seeing Pokémon 2000 in theaters , I ca n't help but wonder how these American producers read the Japanese scripts . The way it appears , it seems that they read and see something that says ` Insert empty moral here ' in big bold faced letters . It definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on MSB ( extreme sarcasm there ) and created this crap . * possible spoilers from here on * Well , I guess I should first talk about Pikachu 's Rescue Adventure . My first gripe with this came with no narration . I guess they got enough bad comments on the Pokédex narration that plagued Pikachu 's Vacation , and , instead of going with a caring , gentle woman 's voice as appeared in Pikachu no Natsu Yasumi and Pikachu Tankentai , they just cut the narration all together . This would n't have been a problem , except for one thing . Did anyone really understand why the Exeggcute did n't let Togepi go until the end ? Possibly the fans , but I 'm sure not the parents . Then , there 's the theme song . I could n't help but roll my eyes at this one . The Japanese theme song was ` Tankentai wo Tsukurou ' and was sung by Japanese children . It was fun and enjoyable . This one : nauseating . Now , one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing Kireihana . Nice music , fun to watch . That 's changed with the Bellossom . The music sucked for one , but on top of that , they had all the Pokémon talk during the music , which turned out to be jumpy , annoying , and just unnecessary . Oh , and then there 's the Poliwhirl who thinks he 's a Poliwrath . You 'd think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are . Basically , not much could save this little ill fated dub , which is very unfortunate considering its potential . But , I have n't touched on the worst of it yet . You 'd think that the warning signs would 've been apparent to me when I received my issue of Nintendo Power . For some unfathomable reason , I had been placing some faith in 4Kids and the WB . My thoughts were ` well , they screwed up on the first movie , but the second is different as far as the theme goes , so they should do well . ' That in mind , I just did n't pay attention to the warning signs I encountered in the theaters when the trailers said , ` You will believe that one person can make all the difference . ' With the way they said that at every turn , I was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like MSB did at the end of the English version . Then comes Nintendo Power , in which I see all my fears realized in the words ` the main feature ' The Power of One . ' At that point , I became a bit more uneasy . ` The Power of One ? ! ' Not a good sign . However , I still kept some of my false faith . Big mistake . Sitting in the theater , I was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which I loved in Japanese being turned into complete and utter junk . I hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle . I can see a point in that since they did n't pander this thing , repeating it over and over like in MSB . However , it did more damage than anything else in this movie . First of all , the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read ` the world turns to Ash . ' Ah hah . So , Ash is the chosen one ? Whatever . In the Japanese version , the inhabitants of Arshia needed a Pokémon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony . This time , he 's the chosen one . A greater way that this did damage was to Lugia . Lugia was one of the coolest characters in a Pokémon movie .... when the movie was ABOUT Lugia . In this one , Lugia is forced to take a back seat to Ash . In the scene where they 're flying back to the main island , Lugia and Ash are discussing the conditions of Lugia 's existence , not that Ash is going to make all the difference . Overall in this category , Ash was n't really the ` one person ' that would make the difference , since he was helped by many along the way . A lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking . Furura 's flute song was n't nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the Japanese one . Jirarudan 's speech to them saying his collection ` started with a Mew card ? ' Ugh . Even worse , Misty 's outrage originally concerned the way Moltres and Zapdos were being held . ` Why did n't you put them in Pokéballs when you caught them ? This is like caging them to be displayed . ' Much different from whining about him thinking Pokémon are things to be collected like stamps . If there were any real redeeming values in this , they came from Team Rocket . Some pretty funny lines . Not really to make me laugh out loud , but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach . Well , that was officially the last American Pokémon movie I 'm going to see . I 've imported the third one and find it very enjoyable . I would rather not see another Japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two . I 'll be importing the fourth one as well . Forget you , Kids WB and 4Kids . You have forsaken me for the last time .
pos	My personal feeling is that you can not divorce this movie from its political / historical underpinnings like so many ( American ) reviewers tend to do . This is not about growing up on Main Street , USA . It is about growing up in Yugoslavia at a time when it was torn between the East and the West . Just like the guys are torn between Esther and everybody else , and Esther is torn between the " Tovarish Joe " and the guys . There is shame in certain situations that is lost on an audience that has never lived under Tito . I feel the movie is under - rated and it is too bad we have lost the director . Movies like this make freedom feel more important . It is not just " another Eastern European coming of age film" ... it is a sensitive portrayal of teenagers walking a fine line that might eventually lead them to real freedom .
neg	JUST CAUSE showcases Sean Connery as a Harvard law prof , Kate Capshaw ( does she still get work ? ) as his wife ( slight age difference ) and Lawrence Fishburne as a racist southern cop ( ! ) and Ed Harris in a totally over the top rendition of a fundamentalist southern serial killer . Weird casting , but the movie plays serious mindf * * with the audience . ( do n't read if you ever intend to seriously watch this film or to ever watch this film seriously due to the spoilers ) First of all , I felt myself rolling my eyes repeatedly at the Liberal stereotypes : the cops are all sadistic and frame this black guy with no evidence . The coroner , witnesses and even the lawyer of the accused collaborate against him ( he is accused of the rape and murder of a young girl ) because he is black . Connery is a Harvard law prof who gives impassioned speeches about the injustices against blacks and against the barbarous death penalty . He is approached by the convicted man 's grandmother to defend him and re - open the trial . Connery is stonewalled ( yawn ... ) by the small town officials and the good IL ' boys club but finds that the case against Blair , the alleged killer , now on death row , was all fabricated . The main evidence was his confession which was beaten out of him . The beating was administered by a black cop ( ! ) who even played Russian roulette to get the confession out of him . Connery finds out that another inmate on death row actually did the murder and after a few tete a tetes with a seriously overacting , Hannibal Lecter - like Ed Harris , he finds out where Harris hid the murder weapon . He gets a re - trial and Blair is freed . I think ... film over .... Then suddenly ! It turns out that Blair IS a psychotic psycho and that he used " white guilt " to enlist Connery . He concocted the story with Ed Harris in return for Blair carrying out a few murders for Harris . now Blair is on the loose again , thanks to Connery 's deluded PC principles ! The final 30 min . are a weird action movie tacked onto a legal drama , Connery and Fishburne fighting the serial killer in an alligator skinning house on stilts ( yes , you read that right ) in the everglades . That was one weird film . So the whole system is corrupt and inefficient , the cops are all just bullies and Abu Graib type torturers , but the criminals are really psychotics and deserve to fry . Truly depressing on every level ! The system is completely rotten and the PC white guilt types who challenge it are seriously deluded too . Two thumbs down . Connery obviously had to make a mortgage payment or something .
pos	The premise of this movie has been tickling my imagination for quite some time now . We 've all heard or read about it in some kind of con - text . What would you do if you were all alone in the world ? What would you do if the entire world suddenly disappeared in front of your eyes ? In fact , the last part is actually what happens to Dave and Andrew , two room - mates living in a run - down house in the middle of a freeway system . Andrew is a nervous wreck to say the least and Dave is considered being one of the biggest losers of society . That alone is the main reason to why these two guys get so well along , because they simply only have each other to turn to when comforting is needed . Just until ... Straight from the beginning of the film lots and lots of problems happen to them . Both of them get involved with crime , Andrew suffers from paranoia and simply does n't dare going out of the house . Dave is unsuccessful at his job and his colleagues do n't treat him very well and with the respect he deserves . The amount of problems they face keeps increasing until that one day where they may have to face the inevitable and deal with it . This is just too much for them and they wish that everything would just go away ... And of course that is exactly what happens . The rest of the story places Dave and Andrew in this world of nothingness . At first they are surprised and have problems understanding and dealing with the features of this crazy environment , but later on they find out that they can do just about everything they want because it seems as if they are the only ones still left . Nothing features an incredibly small cast - in fact , besides the first couple of shots from the film , we only see Dave ( David Hewlett ) and Andrew ( Andrew Miller ) in the entire film . It is clear that in order to pull this off , the cast has to be more than up for the task , because in a world where nothing exists there is nothing that can distract the viewer in any way . Vincenzo has decided to use a reasonable amount of close - up head shots to make it more interesting and it actually works quite well . Director of Photography , Derek Rogers , also has a nice way of teasing the audience by withholding visual information , especially at times where a character sees something and reacts to it , but we do n't see it right away . Obviously , this ca n't be an event driven film and it 's not . Much of the action happens outside their house when they move around in the void . And that 's where some of the most hilarious scenes take place , especially in the case of when Andrew discovers a candy bar . Now , one could be thinking : " How does nothing look like ? " Well , it looks like nothing indeed . The entire world of nothing is white ... white no matter in what direction you look . This is the weakness of this film ... After an hour or less it 's getting extremely boring to look at and there has to be events to make sure it 's more interesting to look at . Thank God , there are some . For example at times when the two lads , due to the properties of nothing , are able to jump really high as if nothing is made out of ... tofu ( as Andrew claims ) . It 's fun to see how they are instantly able to use nothing to become gods of their own little society . One of the best parts of the film is the set ... Production designer Jasna Stefanovic has done a beautiful job in this film , the house in which these two guys live is so unnaturally fun to look at , still it seems right for these two to be living in a place like this . All in all , the production design is with no doubt one of the most powerful aspects of this film at it really makes the film worth watching ... However , the very best part of the film is the acting . Both David Hewlett and Andrew Miller really look like the professional actors they both are . The camera is on them for every second of the film and as previously said , there are just about no props in the film , they are really on a bare stage . With plenty of character development and some decent one - liners , clever dialogue ( at times hilariously stupid ) , it all works to that end - and this really moves the movie away from the low - budget area to well - crafted handwork . Let 's talk a little about the visual effects , because they are definitely worth mentioning . Nothing features digital visual effects and prosthetics that equals any modern horror film . There 's a rather horrifying dream sequence in the film , and although The Drews have milked that scene completely it 's still fun to watch . One of the best visual effects in the film is at the end where Andrew and Dave suddenly discover their powers in this environment - they have the abilities to wish everything away , so what if they can do it the other way around and make things appear ? " Nothing " is a bright and well - lit movie , it really helps promoting the idea of them probably being dead ( this is in fact one of their theories ) , but " Nothing " is a comedy and it slowly destroys its own theory . We do n't know where they are or what has happened to them . We do n't know if they will ever get out , because the movie ends before we see anything like that . The ending , by the way , is not as good as it could 've been . It 's rather easy to predict what is going to happen , still the writers have thought up a few incidents that help make it a little more interesting and in the end , it 's a reasonably satisfactory one . Take " Hollow Man " , " Kill Bill " , " Cube " , " Epoch " and lots of other films and you have " Nothing " . It really is an amalgam of different styles , still there is no other film ( at least that I know of ) Nothing is really like . For the people remembering the original Cube Production Commentary on its DVD may remember that Vincenzo Natali talked about how he came up with the story of Cube . He talks about him and André Bijelic having been room - mates at a time and they both were in this extremely dull room with no hope of getting out , " Nothing " could very well be the screened version of the origin of the Cube story , and to that end , it 's almost like one of the Cube prequels . What can I say ? I enjoyed " Nothing " , it is a great movie and the different parts of the movie are extremely well - made with tons of intelligent ideas , still I feel the movie is missing something and I have problems finding out precisely what it is ... Maybe if we have a " Nothing 2 " I can answer that question . " Nothing " is a great film , but not as good as I expected it to be . Final rating : 7.5 / 10
neg	Hood of the living Dead is about a young scientist named Rick who lives with his brother in the town of Oklahoma where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets . Then one night , Rick 's brother gets shot by a gang driving down the street who fought with him earlier . Desperate , Rick calls his scientist partner to bring over the latest formula they 've been working on that brings sick blood cells to health . The formula has n't been tested on a human , or even a dead body but Rick is determined to bring his brother back to life . He gives the body a double dose of the formula but nothing happens . So Rick calls 911 and the body is carted away only for it to come back to life and feast on human flesh . Now Rick must find his zombie brother before the whole hood is transformed into a neighborhood of the dead . Hood of the living Dead is one piece of trash . The plot is a direct rip off of Resident Evil , the acting is just horrible especially with Rick ' s fake crying for his brother , the guns are so fake because every time the weapon is fired it sends sparks out , and the make up is just lame . It 's only fake blood covered over the actors face . The zombies are also modified . They run , growl , and must be shot in the heart to die ! Zombies should only scuffle , moan , and must be shot in the brain to die ! This film is so horrible , the outtakes is the only true good moment of this film . Hood of the Living Dead gets a 3 out of 10 , a little entertainment here and there but it only succeeds as a low budget cringe fest .
pos	The cast was good , and I thought it was a good performance from Christopher Lloyd , whom I like from previous movies . The movie was a great family movie , nothing that would make you worry to show it to younger kids , a good story line , lots of laughs , lighthearted and enjoyable . If you want to entertain children without being bored to tears this fits the bill . Kid pleasing , and not difficult for a parent to watch , either .
neg	This movie is n't worth the film it was photographed on . The dialog is flat , filled with cliché overused lines and delivered by amateur actors who sound like their reading a script for the first time . The choppy , shaky , film style is a cheap imitation of the " The Ring " style visual effects . The characters do not even act like a normal person would . For example , the character who is looking for her twin sister at her home forces her way through the front door , creeps around the house all frightened and sobbing and she does n't even once call out her sister 's name to see if she is home . What ? You would think she had just buried her sister instead of searching for her . Way too many flashbacks to her childhood . Too many unnecessary flashbacks is a typical sign of an amateur director . It is actually funny watching the numerous shots of the woman driving her car down the street , up the driveway , around this corner , over here , over there , oh a side view , now a front view . Enough already . You would think you are watching a TV commercial for the Solaris ! Terrible movie . 0 out of 100 . I really pity anybody who spent money making this film or to watch it .
pos	This spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen . It shows a China I had never seen or imagined , and I believe it shows 1930 's China in the most REAL light ever seen in a movie . It is absolutely heart - breaking in so many situations , seeing how hard life was for the characters , and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful . You truly see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film . The actors are all perfect , such that you feel like you have really entered a different world .   I simply can not recommend this movie highly enough . It may just change you forever once you have seen it .
neg	Laughed a lot - because it is so incredibly bad - sorry folks , but definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen ... I know it is low budget , but anyway : the actors behave like playing in a soap , the dialogues are absolutely crappy and the last time I have seen such odd pictures was at a trash nite at some youth video festival ten years ago . I really appreciate that people gather together and shoot cheap movies , but at least a certain amount of quality should be accomplished . But at least one good thing : the first three minutes of the movie were quiet interesting and looked okay - and the score was really worth listening to . The DVD cover promised a lot , but that is by far the best this film has to offer ...
pos	well done giving the perspective of the other side fraulein doktor captures both the cost and the futility of war . excellent acting especially when german high command refuses in the name of chivalry to present medal kaiser ordered struck . the scenes of carnage are probably too intense for effete US minds who 'd probably prefer some silly speeches and senseless abstractions like 14 points or the league of nations . real americans might appreciate the story line and the action . for all the action and intrigue , fraulein doktor compares favo(u)rably to Jacob 's Ladder .
neg	I ca n't say this is the worst movie ever made , but personally I think of it that way because when it was originally released in theaters , ( 1 ) the initial buzz was positive enough that my girlfriend insisted we go see it , and we actually STOOD IN LINE to get tickets , and ( 2 ) it 's still the only " serious " film I recall where the audience started snickering at a certain point and basically laughed at the movie the rest of the way through . Once we reached the infamous ( and interminable ) snake fight scene , I think everyone gave up . The only positive I can concede is the lush location shooting . Oh , and there 's also Bo 's breasts , although her acting is so wooden that the nudity is unerotic and does n't rate much more than a Playboy pictorial . The " dramatic tension " in this film is between Bo 's terrible acting and her husband 's horrible direction . The snake fight has to be one of the most incompetent " action " sequences ever filmed . However , this is one of those films that 's bad enough , it may be worth watching on the level of unintentional humor . Definitely the worst film I ever paid to see .
pos	I really like Miikes movies about Yakuza , this one I saw about 2 years ago and it really fu**ed my head . Never before seen such a sick and twisted thing . The Story is good and the actors do their thing very well . I have n't seen the UK or Japan version , but I have to say that I believe that the German DVD is a bit censored . If you have n't seen the movie already and live in Germany maybe you better look out for a DVD from the Nederlands or Austria . The I - ON DVD contains a lot of very hard and nasty scenes , but at the showdown I felt that something was missing , about one or two very short scenes . All in all a good perverted movie with crazy characters and a high level of violence , that 's what I like Miike for ! !

neg	Dynasty Revisited in Hawaii ... Full of clichés , highly predictable , unrealistic and sometimes even stupid . If you have nothing better to do however , it does provide 40 minutes of simple , unpretensive entertainment , endless looks at great male and female muscles and very good photography of the spectacular Hawaiian scenery . On the other hand , If you are looking for anything more than that , stay away ... Oh , and by the way , if you have ever worked in a Hotel or know anything about running one , you have two options : 1 . You will feel sick every two minutes at the sheer stupidity and silliness of how the show presents Hotel Business or , 2 . Look at it as science fiction comedy as I did , lie back , relax , and laugh about it !
pos	I was pretty surprised with this flick . Even though their budjet was obviously lacking still you have to be impressed that this movie took 7 years to make and still turned out good . The acting was pretty impressive and the story really captivated me . My only complaint would be that the ending really was a little too abrupt for my taste . But hey if your audience is left wanting more then this movie has succeeded . I would really recommend anyone in Hollywood to look up Antonella Ríos who is an excellent Spanish talent ( something hard to find now days with all the bad novela over acting ) . Antonella Ríos truly is a star on the rise .
neg	I must say that I was disapointed with this film . I have never been a huge BNL fans , I find their songs kind of childish and obsessively nostalgic ( this is me in grade 9 , if i had a million dollars , shoe box of life etc ) . However , I have seen clips of their live show and I really like the improvisational and goofy nature of the show . I was hoping that this movie would highlight this which is , unfortunately , the most interesting part of the show because their music is well played yet somehow bland and not that compelling ( there is a standup bass solo in the middle which was completely pointless and boring , despite how much Jim Creegan was digging himself ) . The film does not and shows only a few minutes of it ( and you know they 've had better moments , as in the Afgahnistan concert " Koffee Anan , he 's the man in charge , my name 's Steve Paige and I 'm really large " ) . BNL are kind of like when I went to Europe a few years ago and heard that godawfull " Blue " song by Effeil 99 or whatever every 2 minutes , I came back to Canada and then a month later that song was all over the place * again * , I nearly chewed off my own arm . BNL is like that , years ago I remember many a fond memory of sitting around campfires in Canada listening to people play " If I had a million dollars " . BNL was a cult phenomenon in Canada , and much of their humour has a particular Canadian slant to it ( Kraft Dinner is a staple for many students up here , and the name " Gordon " is quintessentially Canadian ) a few years went by where they slipped into obscurity and I was somewhat gratefull . Then all of a sudden they become huge in States , and everyone down there thinks they are this brand new band ( yeah , they 're brand new , but they 're all in their 30 's ! ) while the rest of Canada is going " Oh geez , I thought those guys folded years ago , do I have to listen to ' million dollars ' again ? " The concert footage is not bad , but I would have liked to have seen more of their stage routine , the shooting is not that great , and things like clips from their massive free show in Boston are glazed over much too quickly . The interviews are surprisingly dull for such a funny bunch of guys , I think they 're all old and they have families and houses and stuff and have settled down a bit . There are times when they go into Spinal Tap type of material , where they deliver deadpan satire , then they break into laughs and giggles that kind of ruins it . The interviews with Moses Znaimer ( a Canadian media mogule ) and Terry David Mulligan ( Music dude ) are extremely pretentious and verge into Tap territory unintentionally . This movie does n't really document very much either , I mean , it 's basically one show and at the start of the film , they are already huge and have a massive touring entourage , it 's not like we see them rising from obscurity and " surprise " they are popular , it 's a methodically planned out event , so in the end it 's rather lifeless , kind of half live concert , half documentary , and not much of either .
pos	What another reviewer called lack of character development , I call understatement . The movie did n't bash one over the head with overexplanation or unnecessary backstory . Yes , there were many untold stories that we only got a glimpse of , but this was primarily a one - day snapshot into an event that catalyzed change in all of the characters ' lives . Henry Thomas 's performance was a really lovely study in the power of acting that focuses on reaction rather than action . Good rental .
neg	I did n't have HUGE expectations for this film when renting it for $ 1 at the video store , but the box at least showed a little promise with its " killer cut " of " more gore ! more sex ! " Ca n't go wrong there ! Well ... needless to say , the box is a fraud . How in the hades did actors and actresses of this caliber sign on for a film this low ? It all opens with a drunken college girl walking out of a frat house or some other building like that and saying some useless crap to her boyfriend ( ? ) as a camera on a bad steadicam follows her . Then she gets chased by some dude in a clear plastic mask and grabbed by another . They slit her wrists for no real reason and you can see when they " cut " her that someone drew the cuts with what looks like a crayon . From there , repeat the same theme of the girl getting chased / killed unbrutally by two guys for about 84 more minutes . Add in one tit shot . That is Soul Survivors . I would n't have had a problem with this film had the box not frauded me into renting the flick . If I rent a bad film that claims to have more violence and sex .... I want more violence and sex ! One full frontal shot in 85 minutes from a chick who is clearly androginous and gore that would not scare a child does not cut it . If this is the Killer Cut , what is the Theatrical Cut ? ! Of course , I doubt this garbage was actually put into theaters in the first place . Shame on the actors in this film . I could see them making their screen debuts in here because they have not done anything before , but they were all established before this was released . I do n't know if it was filmed before they had all been established and the studio sat on the film until they were semi - big names or not . But what i want to know is .... they really spent $ 14 million on this film ? !
pos	In life , we first organize stones ( Piedras in Spanish ) such as a career , family , friendship , and love . In this way , we shall find space between these to fit smaller stones , our small necessities . If you act in an inverse way , you will not have enough room for larger stones . The five protagonists in this film are women who have not been able to organize the large " stones " in their lives . Ramon Salazar , a Spanish motion picture director defines his first feature Stones in this way . The film tells the parallel , conflicting trajectory of five women : Anita ( Monica Cervera , 1975- ) , Isabel ( Angela Molina , 1955- ) , Adela ( Antonia San Juan , 1961- ) , Leire ( Najwa Nimri , 1972- ) , and Maricarmen ( Vicky Pena , 1954-).All are endeavoring to remove the stones that insistently appear in their path or , worst , that are in their shoes . They are five Cinderellas in search of Prince Charming and a new chance in life . The best story of these five Cinderellas is that of Anita ( Monica Cervera ) who also stars in " 20 Centimeters , " " Busco , " " Crimen Ferpecto , " " Entre Vivir y Sonar , " " Hongos , " and " Octavia .

neg	Unfortunately for Sarah Silverman this show does n't compliment her at all . The character is n't even remotely likable and it 's not a situation where you think " oh she 's such i b*tch i love her " just " she 's such a b*tch".This character is just a plain old self righteous , mean , b*tch . Sarah seems to struggle to have to carry this show because she 's the only semi funny one in it . The mood , the dialogue it 's all so damn boring and dry it 's like listening to your grandpa go on and on about the marbles he collected as a kid . The Sarah Silverman Program is so unbelievably boring that i was thinking of changing the channel to watch old repeats of Married With children something that is funny because the characters are so " immoral " and " rude".I'm sorry but i do n't find a show packed with dry humour and corny off the wall story lines about some angry , bitter , loser 's angry , bitter life with her annoying as hell sister and gay friends who sound like Keanu Reeves with a cold anywhere close to funny . I ca n't stand this show even though generally i find Sarah Silverman to be that " I love her cause she 's such a b*tch character " like in School Of Rock , and most of her stand up . I think this show is boring with characters who think being mean and saying and doing things for shock value eg . the constant pube , diarrhea and $ hit in general for laughs . The Sarah Silverman program attempts to be funny and fails it either needs a laugh track or better writers . Someone compared it to South Park but it 's not even close . I've expressed my opinions on The Sarah Silverman Program and wo n't become an annoying troll meaning you wo n't see me being a b*tch and constantly posting stuff like " This show sucks " and " Why is n't this cancelled yet".I do n't like The Sarah Silverman Program if you do enjoy .
pos	This is a bit of a puzzle for a lot of the artsy Lynch crowd . They tend to try to write this off as some kind of meaningless , crude , side project of Lynch 's . Like this is Lynch passing gas between his real pieces of film art . Well it may be a fart , but its one of those intriguing farts that you catch of a whiff of and are embarrassed to admit you enjoy . Dumbland distilled down beyond this is art . What can you do with aspects of modern life but laugh at it . If you took it seriously you would go nuts . You hook into it , smell it , taste it , feel its agonies , its unreasoning stupidities , and then express it in any medium you choose . That s called art , and art is n't dumb . But it is Dumbland .
neg	This movie stinks . The stench resembles bad cowpies that sat in the sun too long . I ca n't believe that so many talented actors wasted their time making such a hopelessly awful film . Whew !
pos	Gung Ho tries to express many ideas and entertain us with a wiseguy comedy at the same time . The result is uneven , but generally entertaining . Keaton balances all three aspects of his lead character quite well . Wantabedde is even better . One warning : George Wendt is very poor in his supporting role . Otherwise , this is quite enjoyable time capsule .
neg	  Not only do alien visitors look exactly like furry armpitted human woman and not only are alien visitors able to perfectly speak English ( with an Australian accent ) they ALSO call their stars by the SAME names our Earthly astronomers have given them ! And topping all that off , all alien life knows just how mean , evil , wasteful and destructive us humans are . And they 're quite willing to tell us just how bad that is . If you ever have the chance to see this movie , do n't . Well , unless you suffer from insomnia or the choices are this movie or exploratory surgery without anesthesia . This movie tries to get a moral , ecological point across but only succeeds in making you yawn and pray it ends soon .
pos	The animation was fab and the film funny . The two circus bugs , Tuck / Roll were very funny . If you waited till the credits at the end , you saw a very funny sequence of film , where they showed the bugs pretending to do things wrong like in other movies , that was clever as it made the characters more human and beliveable .
neg	I bought the DVD version of this movie on the recommendation of my wife who loved the version she saw aired in television . But the version put to DVD was a disaster . The lighting was poor to non - existent and entire scenes were simply excised . In one instance Adele is being put to bed , and we immediately cut to another scene - coming in in mid - sentence - where it 's the next night . Characters such as Grace Poole and Mason are never even introduced , leaving one to wonder if they 'd dozed off for a few minutes during the movie . The DVD we saw was produced by Platinum Disc Corp and even at $ 6.32 it was a gyp . Be careful which version of this movie you buy ! We 're sending this one back .
pos	This film ( like Astaire 's ROYAL WEDDING - which was shown after it on Turner Classic Network last night ) is famous for a single musical sequence that has gained a place in Gene Kelly 's record : Like Fred Astaire dancing with a clothing rack and later dancing around a room 's walls and ceiling , this film had Gene Kelly dancing in a cartoon sequence with Jerry Mouse . The sequence is nicely done . What is forgotten is that Kelly is telling the story behind the cartoon sequence to Dean Stockwell and his fellow child students at school during a break in the day , and sets the stage for the sequence by having Stockwell and the others shut their eyes and imagine a pastoral type of background . Kelly even changes the navy blues he actually wears into a white " Pomeranian " navy uniform with blue stripes on it . Jerry Mouse does more than dance with Gene . He actually talks - a first that he did not repeat for many decades . He also finally puts Tom Cat into his proper place - Tom briefly appears as King Jerry 's butler , trying to cheer him with a platter of cheeses . But the sequence of the cartoon with Kelly took about seven minutes of the movie . Far more of this peculiar film is taken up with Kelly 's story of the lost four day furlough in Hollywood , and how Kelly ends up meeting Katherine Grayson and ( with Frank Sinatra ) stalking Jose Iturbi at the MGM film studio , the Hollywood Bowl , and Iturbi 's own home . Except that the two sailors mean no harm this film could have been quite disturbing . Kelly has saved Sinatra 's life in the Pacific , and is getting a medal as a result . They are both among the crewmen back in California who are getting a four day leave . But the script writers ( to propel what would be a short film - Kelly has plans to spend four days having sex with one " Lola " , an unseen good time girl in Hollywood ) saddle Gene with Frank .   It seems Frank is one of those idiots that appear in film after film of the movie factories ( particularly musical comedies ) who are socially underdeveloped and in need of " instruction " about meeting girls ( or guys if the characters are women ) . Frank insists that Gene help " teach him " how to get a girl . Just then a policeman takes them to headquarters to help the cops with a little boy ( Stockwell ) who insists on joining the navy ( and wo n't give the cops his real name and address ) . When a protesting Kelly is able to get this information out of Stockwell by asking him some straight questions ( which the cops could not ask ) , they insist Kelly take the boy home to his aunt ( Grayson ) . Still protesting , Kelly gets saddled with increasingly complicated problems ( mostly due to Sinatra 's simplistic soul view of things ) . He misses seeing Lola the next day by sleeping late - Sinatra felt he looked so peaceful sleeping he did not wake him up . He keeps getting dragged back to Grayson 's house , as Sinatra feels she is the right woman for himself , but needs Kelly to train him in love making . I suppose my presentation of the plot may annoy fans of ANCHORS AWEIGH , but I find this kind of story irritating . While the singing and dancing and concert music of Kelly , Sinatra , Grayson , and Iturbi are first rate , it is annoying to have to take the idiocies of someone like Sinatra 's character seriously . In the real world Kelly would have beaten the hell out of him at the start for following him at the beginning of the four day furlough - what right has he to insist ( as Sinatra does ) that someone who saves their life should assist him on learning how to date ? That kind of crap always ruins the total affects of a musical for me - unless the musical numbers are so superior as to make me forget this type of nonsense . The stalking of Iturbi is likewise annoying . Kelly tries to get Grayson to like Sinatra when he says Sinatra can get her a meeting with Jose Iturbi to audition her singing ability . For much of the rest of the picture Sinatra and Kelly try to do that , and keep floundering ( at one point - for no really good reason - Grayson herself ruins Kelly 's attempt to get an interview at MGM with Iturbi ) . It is only sheer luck ( that Iturbi feels sorry for an embarrassed Grayson ) that she does give him an audition of her talent .   Kelly , by the way , ends up with Grayson . Sinatra 's conscience at not being able to help her see Iturbi makes him ashamed of his bothering her ( but not pulling Kelly into it , oddly enough ) and he meanwhile accidentally stumbles into meeting a waitress ( Pamela Britton ) from his native Brooklyn . And naturally , without any assistance from Kelly , Sinatra and Britton fall in love . Ah,"consistency " ! Thy name is not " screenwriting " necessarily !
neg	  As usual , I was really looking forward to a new TV / film on a favourite subject of mine - makes a nice change from a * strangely familiar * documentary about Kursk or Stalingrad on the History Channel . I avidly looked forward to Pearl Harbour and Enemy at the Gates - but was rudely brought down to earth with the realisation of the malevolent , stupid - ifying power of Hollywood - and its ability to spend an absolute fortune on tripe . So yet again I got excited about ' The Rise of Evil ' , especially as I heard that Ian Kershaw was involved , as I 've enjoyed his books . I can see why he quit . To quote some guy responsible for this rubbish : " The Kershaw book was an academic piece , " he said . " It was quite dry . We needed more incidents . "   Incidents ? Are they totally nuts ? Hitler 's life can not be said to be without ' incident ' - yes Kershaw 's two volume Hitler biographies were long and detailed , but they were supposed to be . The thesis behind ' Rise of Evil ' seems to be : Hitler was a very bad man - no he was a VERY bad man , who HATED jews , and just in case you miss this , we 're going to emphasise the fact in EVERY scene in the film . There was no effort whatsoever to try and explain the mood of the time , and why Hitler may have adopted the views and strategy he did . Needless to say - unlike the generally excellent ' Nazis - A Warning from History ' - this film neglected to point out the fact that nearly all of the leaders of the Munich communist rising were Jewish , and that this may have coloured his views on the subject - and his axiomatic linking of the jews with Bolshevism - an absolutely crucial aspect to understanding much of the Nazi era . But there was not much understanding to be done - the film - makers were n't going to go there , so we just got all the stuff we knew about anyway . We certainly do n't get the fascinating fact that Kershaw alludes to , which has Hitler briefly being a socialist / communist immediately after WW1 . That would of course be far too complex for the film to handle , and might even detract from the relentless ' he was very bad ' mantra which bangs away incessantly . We know he was a bad man . However , we also know that he was a mesmerising figure both as a public speaker and in more private situations . He could be polite and even sympathetic , and of course espoused some views like vegetarianism , anti - alcohol and anti - smoking that many Guardian readers could agree with . He was also famously fond of animals , hence why that wholly invented dog - flogging scene was so absurd . He was also , from all the accounts I 've seen , a brave soldier in WW1 . Whilst we saw him with his Iron Cross , we never get to see how he won it ( acts of bravery were not in the script , needless to say ) . We also get no insight whatsoever into why he was so fired up by his war experiences , whilst Sassoon , Owen , Brook , Remarque and so many others found it so repellent an experience . And again , like the point above re the jewish / bolshevik link , this is vital to anyone 's understanding about the subject . Why did he love war so much ? Why did he think it was always a good idea , despite massive evidence to the contrary ? Why did n't he care about his colleagues who died ? Or maybe he did - but still drew the wrong conclusions . This film certainly did n't have anything of any interest to say on this either . As all too often these days , the film is a classic example of ' making history relevant to the present ' and inventing stuff or leaving awkward facts out to fit in with ' the present ' - which all too often is to cater to the lowest common denominator , where you do n't trust your audience an inch , so you just ram stuff down their throats , knowing ( sadly correctly ) that you 'll always get away with it because there are so many dumb fools in the world . History is really about making us relevant to the past and seeing how it colours our present , for better and for worse . This rubbish was a great opportunity , lost again . They spent millions on it , and the locations and large scenes were impressive , but told us nothing at all we did n't know already , and promoted no understanding of this dark period in human history . WT
pos	This movie scared the crap out of me ! I have to admit that I spent most of the film watching through my fingers but what I saw was really scary . I screamed out loud two or three times during the show . Film - making - wise my favorite aspects were the sound and photography . The sound was particularly great and the setting was really creepy beautiful . I read somewhere that it 's some weird husband and wife team that made it . For some reason that makes this even stranger for me .   If you enjoy the jumps and jitters of scary movies than this one is for you ! Very suspenseful and a great movie to rent with a bunch of friends who love to watch movies curled up on a sofa screaming like little girls !
neg	The minute the forward started , I knew we were in for trouble ! The premise is laughable at best . The story line was even worse , if that is possible . The acting was stiff and the actors gave off a sense of inexperience . You expect more from the likes of Slater , Reid and Dorff . Lines were delivered as if from a robot . And I 'm sorry , I like Reid but she was VERY unbelievable as an archaeologist . Slater and Dorff picked a lousy film to try and stage their comebacks .   The continuity was off through out the entire film . The creatures were n't bad , but they really were n't good either .   Bottom line , I want that ninety minutes of my life back . They can keep the money , but give me the time ! What a waste .
pos	The Life and Time of Little Richard , as told by Little Richard , as produced and directed by Little Richard , was about as one sided as one of his songs . This is not a biography or even a docudrama , but does have good writing , great energy and an outstanding leading actor playing Richard . All the music is by Little Richard , so it rocks a tight lipsync on every song . The movie covers his early childhood , carrys thru the formative years in music , the wild success and Richard 's throwing it all away to praise the Lord . Its all tied together well and the obvious comeback in 1962 manages to stay away from the idea that Little Richard discovered the Beatles , whom opened for him . My main objection is that his outrageous , counter cultural behavior is underplayed and you get no feel for how his audience experienced him at that time . Some of his energy , which he still has , does not come across full force . He seemed tame , compared to what I remember of him at the time . The best scenes are Richard getting jilted by Lucille and writing a song about it and the strip to bikini shorts while performing , to make the point about not having a decent place to change . If they had gotten into the " Bronze Liberace " as Richard use to refer to himself in interviews , then there 's a story . Trust me I just saw him perform a couple of months ago and he still flirts with the pretty white boys , giving the one particularly good dancer in the audience , his headband . Nearly 68 and still going strong I recommend this movie and any concert or T.V. appearance you can find . Little Richard is always on
neg	Much like Orson Welles thirty years earlier , Mike Sarne was given " the biggest train set in the world"to play with , but unfortunately lacked the ability to do anything more than watch his train set become a train wreck that is still spoken of with shock and a strange sort of awe . Despite post - modern interpretations purporting somehow to see it as a gay or even feminist tract , the fact of the matter is that it was a major disaster in 1970 and remains one today . How anyone given the resources at Mr Sarne 's disposal could have screwed up so royally remains a closely - guarded secret . Only Michael Cimino ever came close with the political and artistic Armageddon that constitutes " Heaven 's Gate".Both films appeared to be ego trips for their respective directors but at least Mr Cimino had made one of the great movies of the 1970s before squandering the studio 's largesse , whereas Mr Sarne had only the rather fey " Joanna " in his locker . Furthermore,"Heaven 's Gate " could boast some memorable and well - handled set - pieces where , tragically,"Myra Breckinridge"s cupboard was bare . Simply put , it is overwhelmingly the worst example of biting the hand that feeds in the history of Hollywood .
pos	Certain elements of this film are dated , of course . An all white male crew , for instance . And like most Pre - Star Wars Science Fiction , it tends to take too long admiring itself . But , still , no movie has ever capture the flavor of Golden Age Science Fiction as this one did , even down to the use of the " electronic tonalities " to provide the musical score . Robbie the Robot epitomized the Asimov robots , and was the inspiration for all that followed , from C3PO to Data . The plot line , of course , is Shakespeare 's " The Tempest " . Morbius is Prospero , and exiled wizard who finds his kingdom invaded by interlopers ... It was a movie that treated Science Fiction as an adult genre , perhaps the first .
neg	* WARNING . THERE MIGHT BE SPOILERS AHEAD , IF YOU CARE . * Okay , the basic premise of this homegrown Texas film is : College kids + spookhouse + evil magic book = scary stuff . In practice , it equals a lot of time looking at the time to see how much longer this movie is going to drag on . A bunch of frat boys , along with assorted girlfriends & volunteers , is setting up a charity haunted house . The project is being presided over by a thoroughly repellent character , whose main purpose seems to be verbally & physically assaulting as many cast members as possible . I had a hard time believing that anyone would even attempt to work with this person in any capacity : he 's nothing but rude and abusive to everyone , including his girlfriend and his buddy . Regardless , the kids are visited by local character & annual pumpkin - carving champion " Pumpkin Jack " , an elderly coot who is described as the " Santa Claus of Halloween " , and who drops off a load of props for the house , including an ominous book that figured prominently in the irritatingly strobe - flashed prologue(where a gaggle of robed cultists get turned into stir - fry ) . Needless to say , some damn fool starts messing with the book , and eventually most of the costumed monsters turn into real ones , and the remaining few normal folk have to try and survive . There 's some good stuff in this film , but not much : everything is shot well , and the makeup effects are decent . On the other hand , the performers either underact , or overact drastically ; much of the plot makes little sense outside of a " this happens so that can happen " series ; there is hardly any musical score to speak of , just snatches of songs throughout the film ; and the movie takes an hour to actually get anywhere . That last problem is the most telling : two - thirds of the 90 minute running time is used to repeatedly set up the characters . Tom is a nice guy dating Heidi the control freak , but he used to date Jill , who is now dating Dan the jerk , but she 's started a relationship Kira the girl who wears too many shawls / capes . Dan is a really big jerk , Gary likes to play jokes , and Steve & Lily like to have a lot of sex . Stuff that could have easily been dealt with in 20 minutes or so drags on and on , to the point where the lesbian " sex " scene(calm down , it 's pretty tame ) left me looking for the fast forward button . That leaves us with half an hour of lo - calorie scares , a klunky ending and a deep - seated dislike of ol' Pumpkin Jack , who I blame for the whole mess . Unless you can get this on some sort of deep - discount rental(and really have seen everything else in the store ) , put it back on the shelf and keep looking .
pos	As someone who was born to a German mother and English father ( who spent five years in a prisoner of war camp ) I come from unique position . One of having to deal with the various Nazis on one side of the family and the victors of WW2 on the other . This miniseries can not delve into every single part of Hitler 's psyche and must give the viewer a general flavor of the situation at the time and as best as one can Hitler 's state of mind . In this the series does quite well . Carlyle is very good as is O'Toole , I would however liked to have got more information on the relationships with others in party Because Hitler did not do anything on his own . He had people around him that followed him to the letter often without question and certainly without question later on in his murderous career . What was going through Goebbels , Goring and Hess 's mind ? It would have been helpful to see more of these relationships . But I hope it will make people research the subject more . It might also make people understand why someone like Saddam Hussein can not be allowed to continue in power .
neg	Every generation fully believes it is living in the end times . This has been true for thousands of years now . And movies like this feed on this . How did they get the great Orson Welles to narrate this train wreck ? This is a documentary about the biblical prophecies of Armageddon . It tries to link the prophecies as well as it can to what was happening in the times it was made , making it obviously dated and kind of silly . The reenactments look like they are out of " Unsolved Mysteries " but without the high production values . People should have been embarrassed to take part in this . In short , the movie is dated , silly , reactionary , and useless . Good if you want a good laugh , but not good enough to actually look for .
pos	I know it is fashionable now to hate this movie . I have seen hundreds of spook films including he original 1963 Haunting as well as most of the Hammer films . This film is not restrained and does not hold back at all which is probably why so many modern viewers seemed not to like it . Yet many viewers can accept out of control films like Scream because knife killers are more easy to believe for most people than demons or ghosts . Actually this film had many great scenes and the acting and special effects were great . I have seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time . The director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish films and was not trying for the type of realism of the 6th sense . The Haunting lets go and is certainly not boring . Perhaps this film might appeal more to John Carpenter fans but more of an traditional plot structure . The old Haunting was also a fine film from 1963 . It was even more scary . See both and also The Innocents and The Legend of Hell House with Pamela Franklin .
neg	This has to be the worst movie I have seen . Madsen fans do n't be drawn into this like I was . He is only in it for a maximum of five minutes . This movie is so bad that the only reason why you would watch it is if all the rest of the movies on earth as well as t.v . had been destroyed .
pos	In the old commercial for blank audio cassettes , the tag line was " is it real or is it Memorex ? " The same might be said for the events in this episode - a compilation and remix of " The Cage , " the first pilot of Star Trek . Mr. Spock has cleverly commandeered the ship to take it to the forbidden planet Talos IV in order to allow Capt . Christopher Pike , his first captain who has been burned and paralyzed , to return there . Why the finagling ? Because to have any contact at all with Talos IV invites a death sentence . Why this is so is never explained - that bothered me tremendously - but , if nothing else , it adds to the story . After he has gotten the ship to travel to Talos IV , Mr. Spock turns himself in to Dr. McCoy ( the senior - most officer present ; Capt . Kirk was off the ship ) for arrest and says , " The charge is mutiny , Dr. ; I never received orders to take over the ship . " What follows is a court martial in which - thanks to the Talosians - we learn why it was so important ( besides the obvious paralysis ) for Capt . Pike to get to Talos IV even at risk of Mr. Spock 's death . The illusions the Talosians create , the background music and the entire storyline are fantastic . And Meg Wyllie as The Keeper ( the head Talosian ) is wonderful . Call me sexist but it never occurred to me to have a woman in that role but she was perfect ! The Talosians , having given up almost all physical activity and becoming almost completely reliant upon the power of illusion , are also unisex ; you ca n't really tell if they 're male or female and it really does n't matter . This episode , more than almost any other in the series , makes me hope and pray there are other worlds out there and that there are civilizations that are so far advanced ! What a neat thing if this were so ! This is one of my favorite episodes and , no matter how many times I 've seen it ( I even have it on video ) , it never fails to fascinate me . Meg Wyllie LOOKS like an alien and I do NOT mean that unkindly .
neg	I think this is almost all I need to say . I feel obliged to explain my actions though . I 've basically never seen such an armature production , and I mean that in all senses of the word . Although he physical camera work , boom MIC operation and other technical aspects of this film are laughable , unfortunately its not the only areas .   Unlike some classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts great characterization and plot , this unfortunately has an awful script , awful acting and worst of all , awful annoying characters .   It 's a crime that for the every independent film that gets , distribution like Haiku Tunnel , there 's a 101 other indie films that died silent deaths . I do n't know who the Kornbluth brothers know at Sony , but that can be my only explanation as to how this amateur family production ever got distribution . I 'm quite bemused as to why they picked this up . The ONLY part of this film that holds out any intrigue is its title . However , the reason for that is even a let down . I hope this review will save a few people that may be intrigued by this films title from going to watch it . I 've seen a lot of films in my time , and I 'm very forgiving when in the cinema , but this was too much . I 'll never forget ' tunnel ' , for marking an important point in my life experience of cinema . Shame it 's such a low point .
pos	When I saw the Dentist , I thought it was very cool . But this movie is not for everyone , especially people who do not like gory scenes as the Dentist has lots of gory scenes . That 's why it has it 's R18 rating . It 's about a beverly hills dentist Dr Alan Feinstone , who finds his wife Brooke cheating on him with the poolman . It 's best to go to your dentist " before " you watch this . But if you do n't like going to the dentist already , then it 's best not to watch this as you may be put off going for life . the Dentist has the best bloody revenge in it that I 've ever seen . Who has ever seen a movie that has a dentist ( Spoiler ) pull out all his cheating wife 's teeth and cut out her tongue with no anesthetic ? Overall awesome flick , but not for everyone .
neg	I saw the 10 p.m. showing and I must say that this movie was nothing special . Although I did not leave the theater wanting my time back ( as I do n't actually pay for movies anymore ) I did n't really find any redeeming qualities . There were a few lines and such that made me chuckle , but mostly the film seemed to consist of rampant fan service to the younger ( in mind more than age as this film is rated R ) male audience . The fan service seemed out of place and rather distracting as well . I know you all want to hear Samuel L. say his infamous line , but let 's be honest , it 's a whole lot of hype for very little pay off . The only truly horrible part of the film was the CG , which looked very digitized and did not mesh well with the live action on the screen . Now I am a reasonable man , I knew going into the theater that I was n't going to be seeing " Casablanka , " and I am at least thankful that this film is an original ( albiet inane ) idea and not some re - make or franchise spin off . However to be honest , if you are not a part of the cult following you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing the film either in a second run theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months .
pos	It is not as great a film as many people believe ( including my late aunt , who said it was her favorite movie ) . But due to the better sections of this film noir , particularly that justifiably famous " fun house " finale , THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI has gained a position of importance beyond it 's actual worth as a key to the saga of Orson Welles ' failure to conquer Hollywood . By 1946 Welles ' position as a Hollywood figure was mixed . CITIZEN KANE was not recognized as the great movie it has since been seen as due to the way it was attacked by the Hearst press and by Hollywood insiders themselves . Welles ' attempt at total control ( direction and production and acting ) of his movies seemed to threaten the whole system . His best job in this period was as Edward Rochester in JANE EYRE , supposedly shot by Robert Stevenson , but actually shot in large measure ( with Stevenson 's blessing ) by Welles . But the credit went to Stevenson . Only THE STRANGER , a film benefiting from a postwar interest in fleeing Nazi war criminals , made a profit . For five years in Hollywood it was barely a great record . Welles returned to Broadway in 1946 , hoping to recapture his critical abilities by his production of AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS . But despite the assistance Mike Todd , and Cole Porter composing the score , the musical was a failure . His failure occurred just at the same time that his wife , Rita Hayworth , was on the rise with her portrayal of GILDA . So the marriage was going on the rocks as well . Welles had to make money - his Broadway production had led to his personal bankruptcy . He sold his interest in the possible movie rights to AROUND THE WORLD to Todd ( which he would eventually rue ) , and he also sold the idea of a film about the career of Henri Desire Landru to Charlie Chaplin , who was supposed to be directed in it ( and who turned it into MONSIEUR VERDOUX ) . The story goes that Welles , with a $ 10,000.00 tax bill to worry about , called Cohn and offered to do a film with Rita for a down payment . Cohn was willing to do so , but naturally asked what the film was . It was a wise question . Welles was on a pay phone in New York in a pharmacy that had a book department . He grabbed a book with the title THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI , and raved that it was a great thriller . Somehow Welles convinced the normally astute Cohn that Welles knew what he was talking about . Cohn said he 'd look into getting the rights , and sent Welles his down - payment of $ 10,000.00 . After Cohn hung up Welles bought the book and read it - and found it was really pretty bad . He spent time rewriting a treatment and screenplay that would build up Rita 's character of Elsa Bannister . Certainly it has a curious plot development . Michael O'Hara is a seaman / longshoreman . He rescues Elsa Bannister , when she is apparently attacked by gangsters in a park in San Francisco . Elsa is married to Arthur Bannister ( Everett Sloane ) a crippled criminal lawyer with a great reputation . She convinces him to hire Michael as the skipper of their yacht . The cruise also contains Bannister 's sinister partner George Grisby ( Glenn Anders ) and one Sidney Broome ( Ted De Corsia ) who turns out to be a detective hired by Bannister to watch Elsa . When they can Michael and Elsa try to find time together , but Broome or Grisby keeps showing up . Grisby makes Michael an offer - he wants ( for reasons connected to his so - called fatalistic view of modern society ) to drop out of it , pretending to be dead . According to Grisby ( the plot becomes murky here ) he can still collect his life insurance ( although dead ? ) and use it to run off to the South Seas . He will pay Michael $ 10,000.00 if he will pretend to shoot Grisby . This includes actually signing a document admitting to the murder ( Michael does not realize that such an admission would wipe out the need to produce a corpse if all the other evidence suggests that Grisby is probably dead ) . Of course Grisby is killed , and Michael is arrested for that , and for the murder of Broome ( shot with Michael 's gun ) . Michael is tried with Bannister defending him , and discovers that the latter is doing a second rate job because he wants Michael to be convicted . Michael is convinced that Bannister is the actual murderer , and manages to escape just before the jury verdict . He is knocked out and deposited in a deserted carnival , and this leads to the famous " fun house " sequence and the conclusion of the film . It 's a terribly confusing movie ( as I have had commented on ) . That does not mean it 's not worth seeing - visually it is striking . Witness the fight between Michael and the police in the trial judge 's quarters , where he knocks the bailiff into the judge 's bookcase , shattering glass . Or the clever use of photography to capture Hayworth diving from a rock , reflected on the lecherous Grisby 's binoculars . The acting is pretty good , in particular Sloane ( possibly that fine actor 's best film role ) . Glenn Anders was a leading Broadway performer . He rarely made movies before THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI , and his slimy Grisby is unforgettable . Also Ted De Corsia does very nicely with Broome - a detective who is really looking for his own interests , to his own cost . As for Hayworth , she turns in a performance that was unlike most of what she had done before ( BLOOD AND SAND , TALES OF MANHATTAN , and THE STRAWBERRY BLOND are exceptions ) , and is a memorable siren . Welles ' O'Hara is a very unusual character for the actor - a likable but naive man who learns the hard way not to believe what he secretly wants to believe . It 's not KANE , AMBERSOMS , OTHELLO , TOUCH OF EVIL , or CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT , but it is a good film for all that .
neg	Boris Karloff is Matthias Morteval , a dying , lonely old nut who lives in Morhenge Mansion with some servants and tells his doctor friend , " Do n't try to doctor me , doctor ! I 'm disgustingly healthy ! " He invites his nieces and nephews to his home and warns them they may have inherited a genetic disease that causes madness by " shrinking the brain " ( ? ) * * * SPOILERS * * * Morteval / Karloff ends up dying , and murderous " toys " ( designed by his dead brother ) start killing off the relatives . A mini cannon fires real bullets into a guys face , a life - sized knight in armor attacks with an axe and a dancing Sheik stabs people with a knife . One guy getting strangled makes some hilarious faces . At the end , Julissa and her boyfriend find Karloff is still alive and hiding out in the dungeon where steel gates seal off the room . He plays the recurring organ theme music ( sort of a death rattle used for the killings ) , the brother 's spirit starts talking ( " The whole house will go with me ! " ) and the mansion goes up in flames . This senseless mess is too dark , boring and the stupid dialogue never matches the lips .
pos	The movie starts out with a bunch of Dead Men Walking peeps sitting in individual cells , waiting for their inevitable meeting with death represented by the electrical chair .   Then our " hero " , who is called Tenshu , is taken to the chair , he 's zapped , and then .... he 's still " Alive " . AHA ! He is given a choice by some creepy military guys who look really cool : Either we zap you until we 've made sure you 're actually dead OR you can walk through this door and take whatever destiny might lie ahead of you " . Our hero says yes to option 2 , and then the actual story commences .   He wakes up in a different sort of cell ( very high - tech and very big ) , where he finds another cell - mate , who also managed to survive the electric boogie - ride . A voice in the speakers tells them that they are free to do whatever they wish , as long as it happens within that room . Sounds a little suspicious , but the two men accept : What else can they do ?   What these two men do not know is that they have been set together , so they can awaken an inner urge to kill within them . Basically the unknown scientists in the background p**s them off until they decide that they should kill each other . Sounds weird ? Indeed , but there 's a greater purpose to all of this . THIS is the part which should not be revealed , and so it shall remain unrevealed .   But fear not , it is the unknown that lures the viewer to watch more of this pseudo - action movie , fore it has an entirely different approach to the question : How long time can you stand being with a man who 's an S.O.B. and would you kill him to obtain freedom ?   The first hour is basically trying to awaken your interest , it sneaks up without you actually knowing it . Then it becomes a roller coaster ride with WILD Matrix - like action fight - scenes with a touch of individuality to honor the comic book from which the movie is based upon .   The movie is indeed very special , so special that normal cinemas wo n't view it under normal circumstances . However , the story is fascinating , the music is fantastic , and the actors do their bit ( some more than others ) to make the movie truly unique .   If you should be so fortunate that your cinema or video store has it , watch it , and enjoy the fact that not everyone is trying to make mainstream movies to earn huge bunches of cash .
neg	There is a scene in this film at about the 42 minute mark that is among the worst I have seen in some time . As F. Scott Fitzgerald ( Gregory Peck ) and Sheilah Graham ( Deborah Kerr ) are lounging on the beach , suddenly things become tense and Sheilah begins to cry -- at which point she tells her lover about her sordid past . This " dramatic scene " becomes so terribly overdone and histrionic I could n't help but turn to my wife and exclaim how stupid it all was ... as dramatic music swelled on the television as it all came to a phony crescendo . NO ONE experiences moments like this -- no one . Now how much of the rest of the film is true , I can not say , but this particular moment was laughably bad and as fake as an $ 8 Rolex -- and leads me to assume that some of the other reviewers were correct -- the film is a lot of bunk . However , I am not an expert on the life of these two people and the internet did n't seem to clear this up , either .   Just who were F. Scott Fitzgerald and Sheilah Graham and what was their relationship really like ? What I do know about Fitzgerald , however , does seem different from what I saw in the film . Was he the suave and decent man we initially see in the film ? Well , considering he was married at the same time he was carrying on with Graham and drank like a fish , I 'd assume he was n't . Was he as obnoxious and boorish as we later see in the film ? Perhaps , but if he was this bad AND yet Ms. Graham stayed with him , then this makes her out to be a complete dummy -- and not someone you 'd like to see featured in a film . And , if he was n't , then the film does a poor disservice to his memory . Either way , it made for a painful and not particularly pleasant viewing experience . The sum total of this film appears to be a tale of two not particularly likable or healthy people . In a dark and salacious way , some might find this all very entertaining , but most are sure to see this as a train wreck with no surprises along the way ! Unpleasant but with glossy production values ( especially the music , which was lovely but way over the top ) it begs the question " why did they even choose to make this in the first place ? " . The bottom line -- it 's a pretty bad film all around and probably not worth your time -- even if , like me , you are big Gregory Peck fan .
pos	Most who go to this movie will have an idea what it is about ; A man loses his entire family and even his dog in a flight from Boston that fateful morning of September 11 , 2001 . What you probably wo n't know before seeing this film is this : How that would feel ; What do you do with that ; and how would that affect you and the way you relate to every waking day ? The story unfolds painfully slow from the gate and then warms up nicely as it gains a little speed while the recently renewed relationship between dentist Alan Johnson , ( Don Cheadle ) and ex - college roommate Charlie Fineman , ( Adam Sandler ) solidifies and begins to take shape . Characters appear in this film whose presence initially seem obligatory and not well developed but in fact , stay with this story , and you find that the simplicity of each character is what makes this story believable - and accurate . Real people inhabit a real situation whereby they can do little but stand aside while one amongst them disintegrates . The pain inside Charlie 's soul is subtly evident from first introduction and grows as we learn more about his character brilliantly revealed by Sandler , as layers of an onion  one layer at a time with lightness and weight combined . It 's so subtle a performance that he sneaks up on you and gets inside your head while you are watching him on screen . Cheadle 's Alan Johnson is equally subtle and very Don Cheadle . Always watchable , the ease that 's apparent when Cheadle 's on screen speaks to his consummate acting skills . Alan 's relationship with Charlie Fineman is delicate in texture , just as the situation would demand . Fineman does n't want friendship , nor anybody intruding into his cloistered life and yet , the likable quality that Alan owns is simple and honest enough to intrigue even a recluse like Charlie . It is Alan who has the task of gingerly opening up Charlie 's carefully sealed life . There is inherent danger in the process . The more Alan nudges Charlie to open up , going so far as engaging the services of friend and psychologist Angela Oakhurst , ( Liv Tyler ) the nearer the danger of pushing Charlie over the edge . It 's an abyss that Charlie teeters on each and every waking moment and one he has learned to navigate through sheer dint of denial . He has denied everything that priorly existed for him in order to exist with his loss . Unfortunately , his grief is one thing he can not deny . Sandler withdraws so deeply into his character 's pain during the story 's unfolding that , by the time he meets his demons head - on , the viewer shares his pain almost equally . Alan stands beside Charlie throughout this exacting process at the risk of lousing up his own perfect home - life - run with admirable grace and efficiency by wife Janeane . ( Jada Pinkett Smith ) While tending to Charlie 's recovery , Alan looks inward and recognizes his own silent screams at the death of the independence he once owned and the boy he has lost becoming a man . His reward for helping Charlie is helping himself reconnect with what he has lost . The theme is much like The Fisher King ; another story of a man who isolates himself to the point of madness from sorrow and loss . Like The Fisher King , the story concludes with the traditional , there is someone for everyone theme . Reign Over Me 's Lidia Sinclair , ( played by the wonderful Amanda Plummer in The Fisher King ) is Donna Remar , ( Saffron Burrows ) a woman on the verge of breakdown and sketchy patient of Johnson 's , who turns out to be the just unstable enough to complement Charlie 's borderline insanity . It 's a good ending to the story , but the one element probably least likely to ring true . Then again , maybe there really is someone for everyone . Devorah Macdonald Vancouver , BC
neg	The past creeps up on a rehab - addict when he reconnects with his ill brother and a former girlfriend after what he hopes was his last stint in detox . " Life 's dramas " , presented here in the most simplistic way imaginable ( not even the writing has any bite or wit ) . The cast is made up of attractive looking actors smiling glumly at one another , and the music and photography are lugubrious ( a couple of the visual effects are laughable , indie - cliché touches that reek of a puny budget ) . Although written and directed by a man , this was produced by a woman , and I 'm not sure but I think this may be a distinct reason why this picture about two men , estranged brothers growing closer , never quite gels , never feels natural or seems lived in . It 's an attempt to get inside a male relationship , but the careful , sterile presentation is a cheat . No one 's heart is in this , living , breathing , or bleeding this material . " The Perfect Son " is quickly diffused by too many cooks in the kitchen .
pos	Pushing Daisies is just a lovely fairy tale , with shades of " Amelie " 's aesthetic and romance . It 's got a beautiful palette , its shots well thought out and detailed , its names and dialogue whimsical and too cutesy to be real , its imagination great , and its romance deep . Watch the blue in the sky pop out at you , as blue ca n't be found in the rest of the sets or shots ( with few exceptions ) . Watch a weirdly natural and totally satisfying song break out of a scene . Its score is gorgeous , its cast is supremely likable , there 's great music , and the two leading romantic stars ca n't touch each other or she 'll die . How much more sexual tension do you need ? ( Actually , I had wished they found a way around this one , but c'est la vie ) . It is simply a show that it is a pleasure to spend an hour with , and I recommend it highly . There has n't been other television quite like it , and I would like to see more . It got me through a flu one crappy week , as it makes for good company . Bring it back !
neg	This was one of the most ridiculous and badly directed movies I 've seen in a very long time . I 've never liked Spike Lee , but thought I 'd give this one a try : bad mistake . The movie is supposed to show how the Son of Sam real life murders affected a neighborhood in the summer of 1977 ; what it really did was center around the most boring characters that I doubt anyone cared for as far as their drug problems , marriage problems , and so on , etc . The scenes that depict the murders are just that , and nothing more ; a shooting and then it 's back to Saturday Night Fever ! What 's even more ridiculous is Spike Lee 's choice to show up as a reporter in the movie : Spike , trust me , you 're no Hitchcock , stay out of the movies , it makes them even worse off . The most silly scene had to be the dog speaking in a goofy voice , which was depicted in a scene before it where it was supposed to have been shot ? ? ? Spike , what were you thinking when you made this film ? Not thinking at all is my guess . People who think they 'll see a crime drama , take my advice and do not waste your time or money on this loser . You 're better off watching Jerry Springer in this case ! Waste of film , I gave it a 1 out of 10 : awful dud .
pos	Kids - of whatever age - do not want to know about their parents ' sex lives . And grown - up children are often seriously baffled and disconcerted by any evidence that aging parents possess an active libido . Lastly , many moviegoers are very uncomfortable watching a dowdy , frumpy widow who would pass unnoticed almost anywhere discover her aching capacity and need for raw passion with a handsome man half her age . " The Mother " is a provocative look at a scarcely filmed reality - a woman who is n't ready to stay home , watch " the telly , " and vegetate after her husband of nearly three decades , and a controlling , dominating chap at that , packs it in with a massive heart attack . May ( Anne Reid ) and her husband have two children , each dysfunctional in his or her own way . The male son lives with a beautiful wife who may well be driving him to the Bankruptcy Court with her extravagant commercial venture . Paula ( Cathryn Bradshaw ) , is a teacher with aspirations of succeeding as a writer . She 's attractive , not pretty , and she seems to have a close relationship with mum - at first . Back at her house after burying her husband , May determines to not stay there . Rejecting typical widowhood with its legacy of boring days and no adventure , she goes to stay with Paula who has a young son . Paula 's boyfriend , Darren ( Daniel Craig ) , is a ruggedly handsome contractor who seems to be taking an awfully long time to complete an addition to May 's son 's house . May is quite taken with hard - drinking , coke - sniffing Darren whose treatment of Paula ought to have alerted May that he was , for sure , a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Cads . What follows is a torrid affair between Darren and the besotted and now bubblingly alive ( dare I say reborn ? ) widow . The love scenes are graphic but take second place to amateur artist May 's pen and ink sketches of their trysts which then play a role in the enfolding drama ( or debacle , take your pick ) . The theater in Manhattan was packed for today 's early afternoon showing with well over half the audience in the range of May 's age . That some were shocked or disturbed to see her disporting herself with erotic abandon in the arms of a much younger man is an understatement .   This blindingly honest look at an older woman 's awakened passion after decades of dutifully obeying her husband 's desire that she stay at home and raise kids ( she also mentions he did n't like her to have friends - what a guy ) surfaces a number of issues . While May 's dalliance with Darren does n't constitute incest , there are real psychological dimensions , and issues , with a mother bedding her daughter 's lover . And Paula is n't made of the stoutest stuff to begin with . The affair , once disclosed , allows the peeling open of the mother - daughter relationship which , from Paula 's viewpoint , left something to be desired . Ms. Bradshaw is excellent in the role of a daughter who wants her mother 's support as well as her love - she has n't been dealt a terrible hand by life but it is n't a bed of roses either . May is strong in her resolve to both acknowledge her sexuality and expect , indeed demand , a future of happiness . But she is also inescapably vulnerable . She 's fishing in uncharted emotional waters . Who controls her relationship with Darren and why are difficult issues for her to understand , much less resolve . In her sixties , she 's still a work in progress . " Something 's Got ta Give " recently showcased mature sexuality but in an amusingly antiseptic way assuring no viewer would be discomfited . After all it 's Jack Nicholson and the always beautiful Diane Keaton cavorting in the world of the rich . And to insure that no serious psycho - social issues were explored , Keaton 's young girlfriend , Amanda Peet , daughter of Keaton , not only blesses the match but insures that the audience knows she and her old(er ) would - be lover never hopped into the sack . No easy out here . Anne Reid 's inspired performance forces discomfort on some while drawing respect from others . Her naked body bursts with sexuality for some and appears absurd as an object of physical attraction to others ( the comments of audience members leaving today reflected all these views ) . Kudos to director Roger Michell for tackling a fascinating story with verve and empathy . 9/10 .
neg	This is exactly the type of film that frustrates me the most . Great cast , great director , great story potential , then they ruin it all with a screenplay that goes nowhere ... and says nothing while going there ! There is no depth here whatsoever . No depth of characters , no depth of plot , no depth of surprise , suspense , or common sense . We know what 's happening , we are told how they plan to fix the problem , they fix the problem , throw a surprise at us near the end that fails to generate any suspense , then they end the film abruptly . Wasted opportunity . On the plus side , Glenn Ford leads a cast of UK ( and one French ) actors who are all fantastic , doing an incredibly impressive job with the one - dimensional writing they were given . One of the absolute favorites is Herbert Walton as " Old Charlie " , who provides some wonderful bits of humor and warmth to a dark and serious film . I also thought the film had a great look to it ... all shadows and fog ... very film noir in feel . Even though the actors do the best they can and the directing is enjoyable , it still just is n't enough for me to recommend spending the time to view the film . There are far better Glenn Ford movies out there : The Big Heat , Gilda , Affair in Trinidad , etc .
pos	A great film this , and a shame that it will receive little attention outside of arthouse circles and students who stay up until two in the morning to watch it on Channel Four . The plot is a simple one but works very effectively , the blurring between child - like fantasy and hard - hitting nightmare is very well blurred . The budget looks pretty low , but to the credit of those involved it does n't show too often . It also has n't dated that much either . I was lucky enough to tape this off the telly when it was on a few years ago , and it has withstood half - a - dozen viewings . It 's one of those films that wo n't appeal to all ; though as usual , those with a more thoughtful approach to cinema would get a lot out of this . Charlotte Buerke puts in a good performance as Anna , the spoilt brat and it is a shame she seems to have gone from the acting scene . Cross is also very good , carrying the stature of his character very well within the context of the picture . There are some genuinely ( and I do n't say that lightly ) disturbing moments in this film , both half - second shockers and more drawn - out tensions . Watch it with the lights out ! Highly recommended . 9/10
neg	There are a number of problems with this movie , but the bottom line is that it tried to do too much with too little . The base story is quite good , but the money just was n't there to do the story justice . The non - existent budget really killed this movie . Stuart Gordon ( the writer / director ) has writing credit on ' Honey , I Shrunk the Kids ' , which was a box office smash . However , that movie had some serious cash backing from Disney . Honestly , this is a good example of when to not make a movie . Had he waited a few more years , technology would have made it cheaper to do many of the effects . ( not to mention he could have found a company with money . )
pos	This movie is about development . People growing and people fading , people surprising and people disappointing . It has it all and more . There is hope , frustration , injustice , justice , love and hate . It is truly a classic drama that has fantastic performances from the whole cast but especially Whoopi Goldberg in her debut role . This movie made me feel very human and proud of it , and I suggest that this movie should be mandatory each Saturday in all prisons in the world - it touches your compassion . Rating : 10 of 10 . PS : I admit it : I shed a tear of joy during the final scene .
neg	Actually had to stop it . Do n't get me wrong , love bad monster movies . But this one was way too boring , regardless of the suspenseful music that never leads you anywhere . The actress had too many teeth and that moment when she makes contact with one of the beasts , was way too obvious a cliché . This film totally betrays the cover on the DVD which looks pretty interesting . From the cover one expects a giant monster , but you get these cute not as gigantic as expected electric eels . Moved on to watch another film called The Killer Rats but that 's another review . Deep Shock was really crap , a big shame considering the fact that it looks pretty high budget .
pos	There 's no shortage of bad dialogue in David and Bathsheba  " I was quite a hand with a slingshot , " " The King of all Israel out there in the darkness exposing himself to the enemy " ( full marks to Dennis Hooey for delivering that one with a straight face ) , " Go and sit with the concubines . " And somehow I doubt a bored David ever told the prophet Nathan " Whatever you say . " He even tries the old " My kingdom does n't understand me " routine on desperate housewife Bathsheba at one point . So it 's probably a tribute to Henry King 's direction that the film is n't at all bad despite the pitfalls much of the first third provide . Maybe it 's the censor - baiting nature of the plot  a married man kills a femme fatale 's husband and gets away with it !  but King brings out the growing moral and theological complexities in Phillip Dunne 's script rather than upping the sin and sandals hokum . This is the conflicted David on the downhill slope , abandoned by a vengeful God he no longer understands , and the film does n't back away from the awkward unanswerable questions about why a loving deity would choose to wreak vengeance on the innocent rather than the guilty . It even offers a genuinely surprising criticism of the sexual inequality of the law , where the failings of husbands result in the punishment of their wives . Unlike King David , which sidelined the king in favour of the admittedly more interesting Saul , David is firmly at the centre of the drama and despite an interesting display of shoulder twitching and a frankly gormless overlong close - up when visiting the site of Saul and Jonathan 's death , Gregory Peck 's performance grows in stature as David shrinks . Susan Hayward is pure Hollywood pro , Raymond Massey is an appropriately theatrical prophet ( why be naturalistic when you 've got a voice that makes the very heavens quake ? ) and Kieron Moore 's Uriah such an intransigent unreconstructed chauvinist that you ca n't exactly blame David for putting him in harm 's way , but despite threatening to soft peddle the film does n't allow David a moral get out of jail free card over his death . With surprisingly strong but subdued design and Technicolor photography this is definitely a cut above most 40s-50s Biblical epics . Fox 's new DVD is a good transfer , including an incredibly hokey ' candid ' behind - the - scenes short and a trailer with brief shots deleted from the film 's sole battle scene .
neg	I basically skimmed through the movie but just enough to catch watch the plot was about . To tell you the truth it was kind of boring to me and at some spots it did n't make sense . The only reason I watched this movie in the first place was to see CHACE CRAWFORD ! ! ! He is so hot , but in this movie his hair was kind of weird . But still hot . However , despite how hot CHACE is , it really did not make up for the film . I guess the plot is n't that bad but what really threw me over was the fact that they cuss in like every sentence . Is it that hard to express your anger without saying the F word every time?The cussing was annoying and the whole flashy , camera shaking thing gave me a headache . All in all , although the plot was OK , I found the film to be a bore and over dramatic . That 's why I only cut to scenes with CHACE in it . LOL Anyways , not worth renting unless your a die - hard fan of a specific cast member like I was . Oh yeah the cast was Hot . The girls were HOT ! ! ! But CHACE IS THE BEST ! !
pos	There are people claiming this is another " bad language " ultra violence Mexican movie . They are right , but more than that this film is a call to create awareness of what we have become . The awful truth hurts , or bores when you already have accepted the paradigm of living the third world as the only possible goal . One of the most important things of " Cero y van cuatro " is the open invitation to profound reflexion over our current identity . Is that what we all are ? Is that all that we want to be ? I am abroad and I realized how spoiled is the Mexican society when the Tlahuac Incident came to light . I still can not understand viewers witnessing a mass broadcasted murder . I nearly puked when I saw some of the images . It was not Irak or Rwanda , just a tiny village near Mexico City when rampage was carried out with the indulgence of media and government . The recreation of a similar situation in this film shocked me deeply . The other stories were good portraying other situations of corruption , dishonesty , betrayal and violence , but I consider " Tamales de Chivo " the best one . The movie is deeper than some " cabrón " and " pendejo " screams . Those are meaningless compared with the actions of the people . With a few exceptions they are all perfect examples of human rubbish . Just like in real life honesty is becoming more the exception than the rule in our country . Moreover , honesty is only rewarded miraculously .

pos	This is the best of the 43 films that Rainer Werner Fassbinder made ; his most successful at least . He was one of the leading directors in the New Germany after WWII . Hanna Schygulla was magnificent as the cold , calculating Maria Bruan , who lost her husband to the War , found him after she took an American soldier as a lover , lost him again after he went to jail for her , and found him agin at the end . Her day and a half marriage before he disappeared was longer than their time together at the end . Such is life . Things come and go , and you do the best you can . You can give up or adjust you way of thinking to survive . Even though Maria adjusted her thinking and did what she had to do , she never stopped loving Hermann , which makes the end such a tragedy . Excellent drama .
neg	The first half was OK , but the last half really , really disappointed . It 's funny the producers even admitted they did n't have a clue for the ending , and it really showed . What s really sad is i have to write ten lines of comment minimum to be able to post this . I really did n't want to include spoilers to qualify my remarks since the show is n't really worth that effort . When Battlestar galatica first came out I was really excited with the prospect of a better remake , it did n't happen that first season border on being space porn . They eventually cleaned it up a bit and actually had some pretty fair drama , so I started watching again . But to end the series with kara being a cyclon god angel , same with baltar and six was pretty dumb .
pos	I work at a movie store , and as such , I am always on the look - out for an excellent movie . I decided to check out Nothing as it sat in our Canadian section , and I 've been trying to support my country 's movie industry . I was in for a surprise . The film features David Hewlett and Andrew Miller in a highly entertaining story that seems to delve into so much of our minds and relationships ... without working that hard . It is consistently comedic through the interaction of the two characters , as well as some funny exchanges ( " We ca n't be dead , we have cable ! " ) . What more can I say without noting that it is worth a shot , even if you abandon it within the first half an hour .
neg	How can you gather this respectable cast of young British actors and come up with such a pile of filmic manure ? Horrible script , annoyingly hectic camera , awfully edited , gruesomely badly acted . Only Rhys Ifans tries to fill his role with life . Another painful proof that " different " sometimes equals " dreck " . Why do the money people fail to read the scripts beforehand ? Do yourself a favour : spare yourself and do something else - like hitting a mallet onto your knees . It 's less painful and more fun than this movie !
pos	I saw this film when it was originally released in 1989 . I enjoyed it then , and I still do now . But what I realize now is that this is quite " adult " for a film with a G rating , especially the notion of dying and going to Heaven . Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work wonderfully together , and Reynolds ' singing voice is appropriate for a junkyard dog . There are some good songs ranging from upbeat ( " Let 's Make Music Together " ) to downright emotional ( " Home to My Heart " ) . I found the plot good , although it does go off on a tangent once or twice . The final scene of the film with Charlie and Anne - Marie is one of the saddest I 've ever seen in animation . A film worth experiencing .
neg	Pieced ( edited ) together from dead body parts ( deleted scenes ) from corpses ( Anchorman ) , the Frankenstein Monster ( Wake Up , Ron Burgundy ) is definitely not a sight for sore eyes ( something you 'd ever want to watch twice ..... maybe even once for that matter . ) More often than not -the relativity of the scenes in WURB are made relevant by a third person narrator . Even more troubling is that the characters in WURB are inconsistent with the versions of themselves that we had at the end of Anchorman ( in opening narration we 're told WURB takes place shortly after the original . ) At the end of Anchorman , Burgundy had grown since the start of the film and embraced having a hybrid co - anchorwoman / lover . In this film , he 's back to his immature antics with prank phone calls to Veronica ( quite clearly these are the more of the same scenes from the original Anchorman spliced in to WURB . )   The part that makes this a movie , a continually evolving story , involves a bank - robbing clan without a cause called the Alarm Clock . These scenes are almost painful to sit through . This part was scrapped from the original scripts for Anchorman . The majority of other scenes involving our Channel 4 news team are clearly alternate / deleted takes on scenes from Anchorman . They go to the same party as in the original , the same original " group bitching about having a woman on the team " scene , and the same cat fashion show segment that Veronica had objections to reporting . Burgundy re - creates their first date with the drive - in spot overlooking San Diego and dinner at his favorite club , Tinos . Neither character make mention that they 've been to the drive - in spot before and when Burgundy walks into Tinos with Veronica , he introduces it to her as though they 've never been before . Oh , and they 're wearing the same clothes as on their original date . Still , I have to give some credit to the filmmakers - even if WURB is nothing more than a clever way of presenting deleted scenes tied together with narration . Between the two Ron Burgundy stories - this is the weaker one . Looking back on it , it 's quite a feat for Anchorman to have risen from the ashes of WURB . You stay classy , IMDb . Thanks for stopping by .
pos	Ben Thomas ( Smith ) plays an IRS Agent who practically gives the store away to everyone 's surprise . What kind of IRS Agent is this ? Most of us have all heard the line by an IRS Agent , " Hello , I 'm from the IRS . I 'm here to help . " Our smile then spreads into a chuckle that says , " Yeah , right . " As you get further and further into this story , you can not figure this guy out . He goes easy on those who are being audited . What is his motive ? Is he from another planet , an angel , a rich guy who wants to do good ? He helps so much we want him to be our auditor should we get audited , of course . Hey , IRS , are you listening ? ( kidding , just kidding ) The pace of the movie is perfect and so much so that clues were ignored that would have told me what was really going on . Intense , repeat intense , focus was on Ben and stays there . The whole movie only works because of Ben as we try to figure him out and I did n't see any clues ( what clues you talking about , Willis ? ) . Not reading the box before watching the DVD movie was the better way to go here . By the end of the movie I finally put it all together . Well , it was obvious by then . And , yes , it 's over the top , but still a great story , mostly because of Will Smith .   Will Smith should have been nominated for a Best Actor Award . The rest of the cast were very good as well .   Yes , it 's over the top and despite the great acting and when you finally get all the answers you must realize that the message of the movie is all wrong . What 's the message ? Believe me , you will wo n't need too many clues to figure it out . I did n't .   Violence : No . Sex : Yes , but nothing to get excited about . Bland . Nudity : No . Language : No .

pos	Claire Denis 's Chocolat is a beautiful but frustrating film . The film presents a very interesting look at the household of a European colonial family living in Cameroon , giving the viewer an informative perspective on the lives of many characters and their interaction . However , the development of these characters is often maddeningly insufficient . For example , a central theme in the story is young France 's inability to form strong relationships with others . Although this portrayal is executed flawlessly , notably in the way that Denis frames the story with scenes from France 's return to her childhood home , the girl 's lack of intimacy with the film 's other characters makes it difficult for a viewer to invest much interest in her development ( or lack thereof ) as a protagonist . The general stagnation of the film 's character development makes it difficult to become engaged in the loosely organized plot . The film raises a great deal of tension between characters , particularly between Aimee and the men in her life , but never fully addresses this social friction , leaving the viewer unsatisfied . The final few scenes are powerful but depressing . Denis 's work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical standpoint , but if you are looking for a film with adventure or drama , Chocolat is definitely not the best choice .
neg	I had just watched one episode of this program and I could n't even get to the end of the program . Every minute I had watched this program my I.Q must of dropped about 10 points . This is basically like a children 's program but with swearing . Not even the swearing and the insults she tells other people made me laugh . Anyways the story must of been written by a monkey and the people who actually put this script for this program through for filming must of been held at gun point and had no choice but to film this retarded , disappointing , horribly acted program . Sarah Silvermann should use the little money she actually made from this program and get some god damn acting lessons .
pos	The 700 Club gives a great perspective on world events . Some have described it as disingenuous or cheesy . I find the program to be informative and inspirational . It is only natural for many to throw mud on a program that has proved to be so successful . There are very few shows that can point to a 40 year track record of success in the world of television media and The 700 Club is one of them . While Mr. Robertson may have been wrong to say that someone should be assassinated , I find it curious that so many people will literally trip over themselves to hop on the bandwagon of criticism . I have certainly said some foolish things in my life . I would certainly be willing to forgive Mr. Robertson since he puts out a great show .
neg	Man I must say when I saw the trailer I was excited . Futuristic soldiers , taking on bad ass Vampires led by genre vet Michael Ironside .... In Space . I mean I was n't expecting high art , but It looked like a potential B movie classic . This was no doubt a TV pilot , reedited some time later into a feature film , after it was n't picked up . Alright I 'll start with the films few good points , the action was competent for a lower budgeted film , and the CGI and locations used were passable . Now onto the bad , first off Michael Ironside was barley in this , and his performance here .... well it was cheesy not in a good way . But as I said he was n't in it much anyways , so I ca n't blame him . One thing that was really stupid , was the PETA type group for Vampires ' , no I 'm not joking , it 's the dumbest most unbelievable thing I 've seen in along time , and it 's taken seriously . Also this film commits one of the major B movie sins , it teases a lesbian scene , and does n't deliver . Most of all what sinks this film is nothing really happens . Since it was meant to be a pilot the script is almost nonexistent and it does n't have a regular ending . Even the main villains , only come in towards the end . If ever a movie needed to up the Sleaze and gore factor , it 's Vampire Wars . In closing I will say the main crew on the spaceship , were all very capable actors and could very well put this mess behind them , and go on to bigger and better things . They just had nothing to work with here .
pos	I.Q. , in my opinion , is a sweet , charming , and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you . If you ask me , James ( Stephen Fry ) really was a dull guy . To me , Ed ( Tim Robbins ) was more suited for Catherine ( Meg Ryan ) than James was . Anyway , everyone involved in this film did an absolutely outstanding job . Now , in conclusion , I highly recommend this sweet , charming , and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you to any Tim Robbins or Meg Ryan fan who has n't seen it . You 're in for lots of laughter , so go to the video store , rent it or buy it , kick back with a friend , and watch it .
neg	You know those films that have you trapped in the cinema ? You 're stuck there in the best seat in the house , centre of the row in your own special sweet spot that you swapped three times before you got just the right seat - and after about what feels like 13 hours you are still trapped there , uncomfortable and itchy , thinking " When the F * * * is this film ever going to END ? ? ? " ( You know the feeling - think of A.I. and The Village ) . Well , Visitor Q delivers a weird variant of that feeling . I sat there for the first 30 minutes wondering when the thing was going to f***ing start ! It is interminable ! So " Arty " it hurts . This is the first Miike Takashi film I have watched . Apparently he makes films by the dozen and , if they are all pretentious w@nk like this , I suspect it will be the last . I 'm not against Pretentious w@nk . David Lynch is up there amongst the top 10 directors for me but Visitor Q is cut - rate , cheap , and nasty pretentious w@nk .   As you may have worked out by now - I hated it .
pos	Let 's eliminate any discussion about the use of non - Asian actors playing Asian roles . The movie is 67 years old . In 1937 studio chiefs believed that any actor could / should be able to play any role . Actors were under contracts , and did not always have a choice about what role they played . End of story . This is a truly great epic story of love , individual rights , class strata , and men / women issues . The centerpiece of the film is two brilliant performances by Luise Rainer and Paul Muni .   Muni plays Wang , a Chinese farmer , who is about to take a wife ( Rainer ) . From the start , he treats her with respect , during a time when women were looked on as little more than hired help . Without giving too much of the movie away , they go through the highs and lows of all relationships , and even though the story may take place in late 19th / early 20th century , the story and much of their feelings , seems credible . Other than the fact that the movie is about 5 - 10 minutes longer than it needs to be , and the performances of Charley Grapewin and Walter Connolly are typical 1930 's cartoon characters , this is a really wonderful movie that , unfortunately , has become a victim of political correctness . 9 out of 10
neg	That 's not just my considered verdict on this film , but also on the bulk of what has been written about it . Now do n't get me wrong here either , I 'm not a total philistine , I did n't hate the movie because it was n't enough like ' police academy 9 ' or whatever , I enjoy more than my fair share of high brow or arty stuff , I swear . ' Magnolia ' is poor , and I am honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed . Long winded , self indulgent , rambling nonsense from start to finish , there is just so little that could credibly be what people so love about the movie . There 's some high calibre actors fair enough , and none turns in an average or worse performance . Furthermore , my wife ( a self confessed Tom Cruise hater ) tells me it 's his career best performance by far . But the plot is so completely unengaging , meandering between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a snail 's pace that even when significant life changing events are depicted they seem so pointless and uninteresting you find yourself crying out for someone to get blown up or something . It does n't help that none of the characters are very easy to identify or empathise with ( well I did n't think so , but I do n't like most people admittedly ) . They all play out their rather unentertaining life stories at great length , demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in ever - so intricate detail and playing out their deep and meaningful relationships to the nth degree with many a waffling soliloquy en route . Yadda yadda yadda . The soundtrack 's dire as well , with that marrow - suckingly irritating quality that I had hitherto thought unique to the music of Alanis Morisette . All in all , it was about as enjoyable a three hours as being forced to repeatedly watch an episode of ' Friends ' whilst being intermittently poked in the ribs by a disgruntled nanny goat . The bit with the frogs is good though .
pos	I decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site . I would have to say it was worth the effort . However , you should take heed that this film will go on for 210 minutes . If you do n't have the staying power , get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nights . Now to the film , what I say will contain " spoilers " and if you do n't mind , here goes :   Alexandre is a promiscuous bum , a womanizer and a gigolo . He lives with an older woman called Marie . Marie owns a retail shop and she provides for Alex . Alex spends his days at cafés and restaurants . The story reveals that Alex had previously impregnated Gilberte whom he used to live with . Gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because Alex had abused and battered her . At this point , Alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out Gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else .   By chance , Alexandre meets a nurse nymph called Veronika and they striked up a relationship . Veronika fell in love with Alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past . Marie and Veronika struggles for Alex 's affection and had a ménage à trois to boot . Finally at the end , it 's revealed Veronika is pregnant with Alex 's child and Alex asked her to marry him . We assume ( as aforesaid with Gilberte 's situation ) Alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family . There is hope !   With the title of " La Maman et la putain " , I deduce Jean Eustache was relating to Françoise Lebrun 's character of Veronika . She was a whore and then she became the mother . Hence , the mother and whore is the same person ? Anyway , what do I know ! French films are mostly ( not all ) very chatty , aimlessly political , preaching , theatrical , insipid , lamenting and full of quotes . Lebrun and Léaud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed .   Not a bad effort . 7/10 .
neg	A scientist on an island is in deep sorrow about the loss of his son who died of kidney cancer . So he thinks : why not turn my dead son into a hammerhead shark . Well , who would n't ? It 's a little hard to cope with the fact that the hammerhead shark that 's killing everybody is constantly being called " Paul " . Also , William Forsythe 's cast as a MacGyver - kick - ass - savingtheday- kinda hero lacks credibility . On the other hand there are a few hot chicks who make you actually look at the screen while shark Paul bites another one to death . As a matter of fact I find bad b - movies quite amusing . But for my taste it would have been a much better movie if it was made for say 1000000 bucks less . Then it might have been fun .
pos	I approached this film with low expectations but was very pleasantly surprised . It is very well done and it beats hands down the ballroom dancing movies of recent years , especially " Strictly Ballroom " . While the music is nice and the dancing colourful , for me the movie is not about dancing . It is about the very Japanese institution that gives male office workers long commutes to work and free time after work for entertainment that does not involve their families . Here we have the man with the complete family and the large mortgage and a flagging zest for life . He is drawn to the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio he passes during his commute and this leads him to try ballroom dancing . Also Japanese is the fact that the lecherous motives that initiated his new passion are made plain but somehow accepted , at least eventually , by family and audience . Attitudes to ballroom dancing , as conveyed in the film , are definitely non - Western , though the discipline and the music are clearly cultural imports to Japan . The cultural contrasts are thus intriguing . Even without the cultural insights , the colour , the dance and the enthusiasm of the players all make this a fun film to watch .
neg	Although the director tried(the filming was made in Tynisia and Morocco),this attempt to transport the New Testament in the screen failed . The script has serious inaccuracies and fantasies , while the duration is very long . But the most tragic is the protagonist Chris Sarandon , who does n't seem to understand the demands of his role .
pos	If there was anything Akira Kurosawa did wrong in making Dodes'ka - den , it was making it with the partnership he formed with the " four knights " ( the other three being Kobayaski , Ichikawa , and Konishita ) . They wanted a big blockbuster hit to kick off their partnership , and instead Kurosawa , arguably the head cheese of the group , delivered an abstract , humanist art film with characters living in a decimated slum that had many of its characters face dark tragedies . Had he made it on a more independent basis or went to another studio who knows , but it was because of this , among some other financial and creative woes , that also contributed to his suicide attempt in 1971 . And yet , at the end of the day , as an artist Kurosawa did n't stop delivering what he 's infamous for with his dramas : the strengths of the human spirit in the face of adversity . That its backdrop is a little more unusual than most should n't be ignored , but it 's not at all a fault of Kurosawa 's . The material in Dodes'ka - den is absorbing , but not in ways that one usually finds from the director , and mostly because it is driven by character instead of plot . There 's things that happen to these people , and Kurosawa 's challenge here is to interweave them into a cohesive whole . The character who starts off in the picture , oddly enough ( though thankfully as there 's not much room for him to grow ) , is Rokkuchan , a brain damaged man - child who goes around all day making train sounds ( the ' clickety - clack ' of the title ) , only sometimes stopping to pray for his mother . But then we branch off : there 's the father and son , the latter who scrounges restaurants for food and the former who goes on and on with site - specific descriptions of his dream house ; an older man has the look of death to him , and we learn later on he 's lost a lot more than he 'll tell most people , including a woman who has a past with him ; a shy , quiet woman who works in servitude to her adoptive father ( or uncle , I 'm not sure ) , who rapes her ; and a meek guy in a suit who has a constant facial tick and a big mean wife- to those who are social around . There are also little markers of people around these characters , like two drunks who keep stumbling around every night , like clockwork , putting big demands on their spouses , sometimes ( unintentionally ) swapping them ! And there 's the kind sake salesman on the bike who has a sweet but strange connection with the shy quiet woman . And of course there 's a group of gossiping ladies who squat around a watering hole in the middle of the slum , not having anything too nice to say about anyone unless it 's about something erotic with a guy . First to note with all of this is how Kurosawa sets the picture ; it 's a little post - apocalyptic , looking not of any particular time or place ( that is until in a couple of shots we see modern cars and streets ) . It 's a marginalized society , but the concerns of these people are , however in tragic scope , meant to be deconstructed through dramatic force . Like Bergman , Kurosawa is out to dissect the shattered emotions of people , with one scene in particular when the deathly - looking man who has hollow , sorrowful eyes , sits ripping cloth in silence as a woman goes along with it . Sometimes there 's charm , and even some laughs , to be had with these people . I even enjoyed , maybe ironically , the little moments with Rokkuchan ( specifically with Kurosawa 's cameo as a painter in the street ) , or the awkward silences with the man with the facial tics . But while Kurosawa allows his actors some room to improvise , his camera movements still remain as they 've always been- patient but alert , with wide compositions and claustrophobic shots , painterly visions and faces sometimes with the stylization of a silent drama meant as a weeper . Amid these sometimes bizarre and touching stories , with some of them ( i.e. the father and son in the car ) especially sad , Kurosawa lights his film and designs the color scheme as his first one in Eastmancolor like it 's one of his paintings . Lush , sprawling , spilling at times over the seams but always with some control , this place is not necessarily " lighter " ; it 's like the abstract has come full - throttle into the scene , where things look vibrant but are much darker underneath . It 's a brilliant , tricky double - edged sword that allows for the dream - like intonations with such heavy duty drama . With a sweet ' movie ' score Toru Takemitsu ( also responsible for Ran ) , and some excellent performances from the actors , and a few indelible scenes in a whole fantastic career , Dodes'ka - den is in its own way a minor work from the director , but nonetheless near perfect on its own terms , which as with many Kurosawa dramas like Ikiru and Red Beard holds hard truths on the human condition without too much sentimentality .
neg	I wonder how much this movie actually has got to do with the 1984 movie " Bachelor Party " , starring Tom Hanks . Is this movie even an official sequel ? This movie is lacking in every department and you 're obviously better off not watching it . For a comedy this movie simply is n't good or funny enough . It relies mostly on the character 's their stereotypical assessments , rather then the movie actually features some good , original and funny moments . Of course there also is very little story present and the movie nude breast than script pages . You just keep waiting for things to finally start off . There is a main plot line in it somewhere but that one is so terribly unoriginal and gets executed so poorly in the movie that it feels more as if it 's something non - existent . I guess there even is a message and moral story in it somewhere but this again is so terribly unoriginal and poorly done in the movie that it simply does not work out . It 's basically a typical teenage comedy , with lots of sex jokes and nudity , only without the teenage main characters , which makes the story all the more sad and tasteless . The movie makes some really wrong jokes , that are misplaced for any type of movie . I regret ever watching this . 3/10
pos	This movie is great fun to watch if you love films of the organized crime variety . Those looking for a crime film starring a charismatic lead with dreams of taking over in a bad way may be slightly disappointed with the way this film strides . It is a fun romp through a criminal underworld however and if you are n't familiar with Hong Kong films , then you may be pleasantly surprised by this one . I was somewhat disappointed by some of the choices made story - wise but overall a good crime film . Some things did not make sense but that seems to be the norm with films of the East .   People just randomly do things regardless of how their personalities were set up prior . It 's a slightly annoying pattern that permeates even in this film .
neg	I am partly a fan of Miyazaki 's work . I say " partly " because most of his films fall into two categories : brilliant , and boring . Sadly this film falls into the later category . This film suffers from the same fundamental problems as Miyazaki 's recent film " Howl 's Moving Castle " . An intriguing premise is set up , but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it . The first third of the film reveals the post - apocalyptic world the story is set in , and actually looks like an very interesting story is about to unfold . From then on things go down hill . The middle part of the film is mostly made up of thinly - veiled eco - propaganda , and the ending is heavily marred by the reliance on the kind of impenetrable spiritualism which ruins a large number of Japanese animated films . Overall the film feels as though someone ripped out every other page from the script before passing it on the the animators . What is left is something which is visually stunning ( although sadly the version I saw was an Nth - generation copy , with poor colour - which gives rise to the common myth that Nausicaa shows her bare bottom when flying ) , but which makes little sense and ultimately left me confused .
pos	One of the ten best comedies ever   This seems a comedy so joyous and light that sings . Keaton 's comedies are _ innerly , harmoniously , intelligently ordered , thought . Wonderfully amusing , deliberately delightful and inventive , THREE AGES should belong to a draft of a comedies top ten if I were to sketch one . A threefold love story will enchant the viewers ; I want to bring here this approachKeaton 's comedy is like Lang 's DESTINY upsidedownor À REBOURS . Again a couple traverses the waters of timeand of epochsin the Stone Age , in Rome and in Keaton 's timesin a Mohammedan country , in Renaissance Italy and in China . The same device works in the both moviesone , a grim , eerie melodrama ; --the other , a light , virtuouslypaced comedy . At Keaton it 's essentially the same couple ; and maybe the same is with Lang . The babe desired by both Buster and Beery is nice . I have found THREE AGES well written and smart , without being ostentatiously sophisticated ; the plot is basically very POPEYElikethe babe is a piece of furniture , the only protagonists are the two male rivalsKeaton and Beery . Keaton 's movie is simply enormously likable , and perhaps one would be tempted to assert this looks like ambitious funyet it 's not , but it is grand fun , large fun , ample fun . And Wallace Beery makes a fine nemesis .
neg	I consider this film one of the worst in the Nightmare series . It was so boring that I could n't remember a thing 20 minutes after the film was over , it even tires me to write a review on it . Okay , # 4 was a joke and Freddy was the joker . # 5 tried to return to the roots of the series . It was darker and more atmospheric than Nightmare 4 , which is a good thing , basically . They tried to shoot a horror film instead of a comedy . Unfortunately they forgot to add suspense and scares . Because of that Nightmare 5 : The Dream Child is neither funny nor is it scary . What we actually get is a boring film with the usual bad actors ( maybe with the exception of Lisa Wilcox ) . The plot ( Freddy killing Lisa 's friends by using the dreams of Lisa 's unborn child ) has a good base but it just is n't enough for 90 minutes of film . Sometimes the story gets very confusing ( maybe because there is n't any ) and you ca n't stop wondering what the filmmakers were aiming at . The screenplay must have had more holes than Swiss Cheese and the film therefore was very cheesy itself ( let me say that I do n't like cheese though , even if I am from Switzerland ) . Not even the special effects were as good as for example in part 4 . Do n't bother to rent / buy this film if not for completeness , it 's quite a mess . My rating : 4/10 ( get used to it , # 6 is also a messy one ... )
pos	This is a deliriously colossal vulgar silly all star extravaganza revue of all the early talkie stars that Warner Bros could afford . ... and like most other rarely seen films actually made during the late 20s , an unforgettable opportunity to see and hear the genuine roaring twenties ' exuberance and youthfulness put to song and dance . THE SHOW OF SHOWS is pretty gigantic . Vaudeville act after soliloquy after tap dance after acrobat after comedian after fan - dance after ukulele lunacy after Rin Tin Tin who introduces ' an oriental number ' ... ( ! ) ... and on and on it lumbers , grinning and squeaking away in fabulous gramophone quality Vitaphone sound . It is far too long , but among it 's delirious delights are the awesome " Singin in the Bathtub " number created on a scale of which The QE2 architects would be proud ... Beatrice Lillie lounging by a grand piano with some happiness boys amusingly warbling a witty ditty , Nick Lucas , and the never - ending grand finale in two color color ... which is all set to the song LADY LUCK . . So keen are the tubby chorus line and leaping teenagers to en - ter - tain us that they almost kick themselves repeatedly in their own faces with glee and effort . Row after row of " Doll " characters hop past and some even emerge from the floor . I kid you not , there are even girls strapped to the crystal chandeliers , mummified with shiny gauze and chained up with pearl ropes , unable to move ( for days , I imagine , during production ) whilst this katzenjammer of toy - box athleticism twitch and spasm below to the Ukulele orchestra . Of course I loved it and had to watch this color finale over and over and then invite friends and family to the screen for weeks on end just to horrify and terrify them each separately and to roll about on the lounge in shrieking in delight at each and every exclamation of their startled reactions . And so should you ... and rejoice that there was an era when this was created simply to entertain and thrill . It is all so demented .
neg	Carlito Way , the original is a brilliant story about an ex - drug dealer who hopes to leave his criminal past and so he invests in a club and the deals with the trouble that comes with it . This film was .... I saw the trailer and knew instantly it was going to be bad .. But after dismissing films in the past and finding out they were great ( Lucky Number Slevin , Tokyo Drift) ... I gave this a shot and it failed within the first five minutes ... The script is something a teenager would come up with if given five minutes to prepare ... It was weak , with weaker dialogue . It seems there is an instant need for romance in a gangster movie . So Brigante decides to beat a guy up for the girl .... and she say 's ' Yes ! ' And if you need to act bad just throw racism around ... As we learn from the ' Italian mobsters ' ... The acting was terrible to say the least ... I found ' Hollywood Nicky ' , hilarious . I absolutely hate all these musicians turning to movies . Lets face it the only reason P Diddy did this movie was so he could play a gangsters ... The actress who plays Leticia was weak but beautiful . The sex scene was weak but we got to see her .. which was okay ... But overall I expected it shed light on how Carito ended up in prison and the love of his life ... And the assassin towards the end completely added to the horrendous movie that is ... Carlito 's Way : Rise to Power ..
pos	Cliffhanger is what appears to be Slyvester Stallone 's last action movie before he became such an underrated actor . It 's about a mountain climber that must help his friend after being held hostage by mercenaries that want them to find three suitcases carrying money over 100 million dollars . It has great action sequence 's , edge of your seat fun and a great time at the movies .
neg	Not that I tinkle myself with glee at the sight of realistic blood shed , but when I put a DVD in expecting a bloodbath , and what I get is one bloody scene ( the eyeball ) at the tail end of asinine fake slapping , and spinning in a desk chair , I end up thinking " well that 's 43 minutes of my life gone forever . " I would n't considers this or Flower of Flesh and Blood " movies " so much as an exercise of will ; to see if you can sit through them . Flower of Flesh and Blood had a few tough spots to watch . The Devil 's Experiment did not . It was at best , stupid , and at worst ... well ... really stupid . Perhaps my expectation were too high . I put the DVD thinking " oh man , this is gon na be sick . " After watching them fake slap the girl about a thousand times , I was watching it in fast forward . Two kinds of people would be interested in this film . 1 ) People who seek out F'd up films just to see how F'd up it really is , or 2 ) horror completest . I sought this and the other Guinea Pig films for the latter reason , but even if I fell into the category of the former , this film would n't float my boat . As a matter of fact , I could imagine this film increasing one 's blood lust ... as in " WOULD YOU JUST KILL THE B*TCH ALREADY ! ! " So in conclusion , the only reason to own this film is for collection purposes . If you want carnage that traditional horror does n't provide , get Traces of Death . Sure , that sucks too , but at least you 'll get the blood and guts you expect . The only reason I can see for anyone praising this crap is because they feel they 're supposed to . No artistic merit that I can comprehend , no reason for it 's notoriety , no nothing . Just a lame attempt to be shocking .
pos	The extraordinary Rosemary Forsyth is the main reason to see this flick . Why she never became a bigger store may never be known . But she is exceptional and steals every scene she 's in . Garson Kanin directed this piece of fluff and the cast is first rate , with Robert Drivas and Brenda Vaccaro especially memorable . A " 9 " out of " 10 . "
neg	I was very excited when this series premiered in 2005 . The premise was very simple and appealing : each episode would be a one - hour mini movie directed by a famous , noteworthy horror director . Then , when I finally watched them it was a bit of a letdown . Some good episodes emerged from that first season , but all in all it was a mixed bag . I attributed it to the learning curve , and figured that season 2 would be a whole lot better . Boy , was I in for a shock . At least season one had a few good stories here and there . Season 2 ( with the exception of " The Black Cat " starring the excellent Jeffrey Combs ) was a complete and total loss to me . The episode " Sounds Like " may very well be the worst thing I have watched on TV in the last 10 years , and most of the other episodes are n't much better . I really hope that season 3 turns this around next year , but I 'm not holding my breath .
pos	I first watched this movie on its release in 1987 and was greatly affected emotionally , through a combination of guilt at what my fellow white human beings could do to innocent people and the reluctance of the outside world to really investigate these atrocities against man . Particularly moving was the Funeral of Steve Biko , made even more vivid and hard - hitting by the South African Anthem played at the time . I have long believed that this movie achieved what nobody else had managed - to open the eyes of the world to what was really happening in South Africa . I consider myself to be a normal right thinking person and I can attest to how this film changed my whole way of thinking about not just South Africa , but how we as white people perceive black people . I have never seen any difference between people of any colour or creed , but after viewing this film I physically changed my life and have spent the last 17 years living in a predominantly black country and helping many people rise above their present standard of living and achieve that which they would not have thought possible . The greatest reward I can honestly say I have received - to be able to say that in my own small way I have contributed and redressed the balance a little . But if more people thought like me and actually DID something to help black people without seeking reward then the entire black population of this planet would be a little better off . I challenge any right thinking person to watch Cry Freedom from beginning to end and not feel that emotion tugging at your heartstrings as you witness the 700 schoolchildren brutally shot dead in Sharpville for refusing to learn Afrikaans , the senseless murder of Steve Biko , such a champion for his own people 's rights , and then , ultimately , to understand that all this is not merely a film , albeit a magnificent one , but that it all actually happened and less than 30 years ago . Yes , my friends , watch this movie and then see if you can go out afterwards and party hard . I could n't . I was too upset at knowing the truth . That is the hallmark of a great film . It was obviously the intention of Sir Richard Attenborough to get this message over about South Africa . Of course he has achieved it . Unless you happen to support apartheid . God help you .
neg	* Spoiler warning * First of all I rated this movie 2 out of 10 . The idea is good , but there are too many stupid errors in the movie , failing to make it the psyching drama that it might have been . First of all she never fights alone . After an initial very strange doubt from her mother ( which is not believable when the mother proves to be so supportive and loving later in the movie ) the rape victim is not alone .   She is also unbelievably naive always falling into the Crew 's strange traps .   Her friends are unbelievably nasty . The thing that I find most unbelievably is that Ethan fails to control the crew when he changes his opinon . Ethan is very much the leader of the Crew ( hey , they even say so ) and people seem to think the other guy is a jerk , but when Ethan changes his opinion he just does n't manage to convince even one single person in the Crew that he is right and that his former friend is wrong . Everyone just simply hates him ... why ? ? The movie provides no explanation . How did he ever become the leader ? A funny note is that my girlfriend thought I was watching Beverly Hills when she came in . Two actors from the same successful TV - series .... a cheap way to get viewers ?
pos	I desperately need this on a tape , not a DVD , and soon ! I have one nephew who is in the infantry but has not yet deployed , although he set to go to Iraq soon after December 2008 . I lost my beloved step son in Ramadi Iraq on 09 - 15 - 05 from an unmanned missile in a green zone . I have another nephew who is joining the army as soon as he graduates from high school this spring because he , like his older brother , has some idealized and romanticized idea about what serving in the military is . My stepson died after only 10 days in country and he never went out on any missions so my nephews have no way to reference any of the experiences shown in this candid documentary from any type of personal experiences that might have been conveyed by my now deceased son .   There is nothing I can do about those who are in , or now gone , but I have one left that has not raised his hand and been sworn in YET . I desperately want him to do so informed , none of the others did . Pleases help me with this . The movie documentary The Ground Truth is the best visual reference I have ever seen . I need to somehow make my youngest nephew see what he is getting himself into before it is to late . BUT : ( do not laugh ) I NEED my mother to see this first . She must actually see and hear these men and women , not simply the idea of them , but the truth of what they will be immersed in , possibly forever . Then she will have the emotional determination to make my brother watch this film and once he has then he may then make his son , my youngest nephew , watch it too . Then , my nephew might begin to take this seriously .   ( ( ( is there another time when this will be shown on TV ? if so please tell me when ? ) ) ) However , my problem is , my mother does not own a DVD player , she still uses video ( is that correct ? with tapes ? ) So , I need to find a way for her to be able to watch this film . Can I purchase this from anyone in that form ? If not , is there any other way for me to get this in the form of a tape from anyone ? Is there any legitimate link from which I can pay to download it onto my computer and then transfer it to a tape . If so who would I contact . I will gladly pay for the privilege providing it is a legitimate link .   Or , if you have any alternative ideas I will consider anything you can suggest . Please help me , I have lost one very precious adored and loved one already , I already know my oldest nephew will never be the same when he returns and I may loose him too . I can not loose three and the emotional toll for all of those that do make it back is too high a price to pay for every male child in my family of that generation . Please help me . I will happily call you , email me a number if that is the best way to get the needed information . Thank you so much for any help you can offer . Sincerely , Lori Swanberg l.swanberg@yahoo.com
neg	The longer this film went on - and it seemed to tediously go on for ever- the more annoyed I became , as quite frankly , what a waste of time sitting through this total nonsense . How on earth do people get to make films like this , or indeed receive finance for such rubbish ? Do n't be fooled by the relatively high ratings on IMDb as it just proves you can fool some of the people all the time . And in this picture the main players have an obsession with guns , so it is not difficult to work out the way this movie will ultimately unfold . America can never understand that the rest of the world finds it bizarre how society in the USA has such an obscene and fatal ' gun culture ' .   Anyhow : The lead actor portrays a loser who escapes into a fantasy world of being a cowboy in an Urban sprawl . He comes across a family with two spoiled brat children , a teenage girl and boy ; taken care of by a strict single parent father who can barely cope . The cowboy is seduced by the teenage girl or vice - versa , and the impressionable boy is seemingly taken in by the lunacy of the loser . The cowboy spends the whole time in a state of unreality and depression . A total loser who prefers to go to the beach then work for living , and then commits a burglary on his family as he is too lazy to make money legally . Ask yourself : Who wants to watch either a sad failed loser in a fantasy world holding a death wish , or indeed view a poor family who are in effect not much better than white trash ? ! This film is pointless drivel . It only saves itself from getting the lowest mark possible by some half listen able music : 2/10 .
pos	Amicus made close to a good half dozen of these horror anthologies in the 70 's , and this , from leading horror scribe Robert Bloch , is one of their best efforts . There are four stories , all worthwhile , but two -- " Sweets For The Sweet " and " Method For Murder " -- distinguish themselves as highly effective journeys into fear . In " Sweets " , Christopher Lee plays an impatient widower whose lovely daughter ( Chloe Franks ) becomes resentful of his neglect and brutish intolerance , so she sculpts a voodoo doll with which she expresses her distaste for his methods . Franks is a beautiful figure of mischievous evil and delivers one of the greatest child performances in a horror film since Martin Stephens in " The Innocents " . This installment is directed with great subtlety and the final outrage , occurring off - screen , is a moment of purest horror . " Method of Murder " is about a horror novelist ( Denholm Elliott ) who is menaced by one of his own creations , the creepy Dominic . This episode is striking for its simplicity and stark terror . Dominic may or may not be real , so director Peter Duffell has a great time playing with our expectations . The brief shots of Dominic reflected in a pond or seen as a fleeting phantasm in a meadow are truly haunting . The original poster art , featuring a skeletal figure clasping a tray holding Peter Cushing 's severed head , was a rich enticement for punters fixed on fear .
neg	An obvious b - grade effort to cash in on the Hostel / Saw buzz , my expectations for this film were low ( really low ! ) and yet it still managed to disappoint on every level . The acting is so bad it 's not even funny , the plot - line is non - existent and the only scare was realizing that I had wasted 1hour 21 minutes watching it ! I 'm surprised to note that 34 people gave it a 10 star rating . I can only suspect that 33 of these are Cast and Crew . The 34th is possibly the directors mother ? - although I 'm sure even she would find it hard to go higher than a 2 ! DVD extras include an hour long " making of " feature . Which raises the question , " Why ? " ( although perhaps it serves to demonstrate what not to do ! ) . Avoid at all costs .
pos	This movie documents a transformative experience for a group of young men , and the experience of watching it is in itself transformative for the viewer . Few movies even aspire to this level of transcendence , and I can think of no other movie -- documentary or drama -- that achieves it . There is no other movie in which I have both laughed so much and cried so much . Yes , it is about DMD and accessible travel ; on those issues alone , it is a worthwhile venture , but it is more . It is about friendship . It is about life itself , about living every day that you 're alive . And it 's a great , fun , adventurous narrative . This is why God created the cinema ! See this movie ! ! !
neg	RKS films always have been commercial films which suited the 90 's , from GHAYAL , DAMINI His last few films KHAKEE were watchable FAMILY was crap This film is a decent film but could be better The problem lies in there is lot of old fashioned clichés thrown in and many scenes come out too filmy and lengthy Ajay Devgan 's character is shown very well but his character gets heroic which could be subtle The lengthy flashback could be avoided as thigns are simply long drawn Even the street play in the second half look too simplistic and hardly a solution though the message is well brought out Direction by RKS is decent , though it could be better Music is okay Ajay Devgan looks the part very well and is at ease playing his part mostly though at times he does look ill at ease in light scenes He excels in dramatics Vidya excels in the scene front of media Pankaj has a not proper defined role and too filmy yet he excels in his part Darshan Jariwala hams as the old age villain the rest are okay
pos	Greetings from this Portuguese guy :) I believe The Sopranos are one of the best production ever , it has reality and fiction mixed in such a way , that it 's hard to see the difference . It has the same quality as GodFather ! James Gandolfini fits at the paper as a glove ! I would love The Sopranos would never finish at all . It 's perfect ! It should be a subject in school :) I saw Sopranos when I was a kid , but I was too young to stay waked until the episode ends , so now I bought the all Episodes in DVD format and I am watching all episodes at home before and after dinner and I am getting addicted , like I did with Prison Break . In my opinion Prison Break and The Sopranos are the best - ever series made for television . The argument of both are splendid and the actors are perfect . Congratulations for such a work . Sorry about my English . Thanks for reading .
neg	This is a truly abysmal ` LOCK STOCK ' clone with a stellar cast and a terrible script . I have no idea why so many top British actors signed up to this junk , they must have been bribed . A miss match of a storyline goes on forever and ever and ever and if I had n't have paid good money for it I 'd have turned it off after 10 minutes . Not the worst film i ve ever seen , that honour goes to the truly pathetic used bogroll of a movie ' ( I use the term loosely ) ` GUMMO ' ( I feel like suing that so called ` director ' for the lost hour and a half of my life ) but this trash is nearly right down there with it . Definitely one of the worst 5 films I have ever seen . Stuff like this reminds Hollywood that they do n't have a monopoly on truly awful films .
pos	The turning point in " The Matador " comes about half through the movie when Danny , an unsophisticated man from Denver , is sitting in the balcony of his Mexico City hotel , enjoying a quiet moment . Someone knocks on his door , and knowing it 's Julian , the paid assassin , he refuses to answer . But did he really ?   Richard Shephard , the director of " The Matador " , presents us with a character , Julian Noble , who shows no redeemable qualities . In fact , we have already seen him in action , doing what he does best . When Julian meets Danny at the bar of the Camino Real in Mexico City , he spills the beans and tells his new acquaintance what he really does for a living . Danny , who has come to sell his program to a Mexican company , but it seems he is competing against a local outfit that appears to be in the front for getting the contract . Danny is a naive person who falls prey of the charisma and charm doled out by the smarter Julian . It 's not until some time later , on a cold winter night that the killer appears at Danny 's door asking his friend to repay a favor and accompany him on a trip to Tucson . It 's at this point that the secret that binds them together is revealed in an unexpected way . Pierce Brosnan , acting against type , makes a great contribution with his irreverent Julian Noble . Just to watch him walking through the hotel lobby in his Speedo and boots gives the right impression about his character . Greg Kinnear , on the other hand , plays the straight part of this odd couple . Hope Davis appears only in a couple of scenes leaving us to lament why did n't she stay longer . Philip Baker Hall puts an appearance as the liaison between Julian and his assignments . Richard Shephard directs with style working with his own material . The musical score is by Rolfe Kent and the crisp cinematography of David Tattersall enhances everything .
neg	If there was a God , he would have made sure this movie stayed in the toilet were it was crapped up . This is BY FAR the worst vampire movie I have ever seen . I may never watch a vampire film again because of this movie . It makes Zombie Lake look like The Sound of Music .
pos	I have watched this movie well over 100 - 200 times , and I love it each and every time I watched it . Yes , it can be very corny but it is also very funny and enjoyable . The camp shown in the movie is a real camp that I actually attended for 7 years and is portrayed as camp really is , a great place to spend the summer . Everyone who has ever gone to camp , wanted to go to camp , or has sent a child to camp should see this movie because it 'll bring back wonderful memories for you and for your kids .
neg	The film is worth watching only if you stop it after half an hour . It starts of with funny conversations in a bar and makes one expect a good , funny story is to come . Well , I can tell you it will not come . It will deteriorate in minutes into a movie that challenges your patience as well as your feelings of shame for the actors to an extend you will probably not be pleased to witness .   In an interview I heard that the director wanted to express in this film the feeling of a loss of identity that , according to him , the majority of the people in this globalizing world experience . I was amazed to hear that . Am I living in the same world he lives in ? OK a lot of people do walk around in the same clothes as mine and listen to the same music and all , but that does n't make me feel like I am losing my identity . What does Khrzhanosvky think , that we are not more than the clothes we wear and the movies we watch ? Am I shortsighted or is he ? Well my vote : the good start of the movie saves it from getting a 1 , a decent 4 is my conclusion .
pos	I really loved it although while reading the reviews it was quite disturbing to me .. But as an anime art fan i can totally understand this perfect art work even though some of it was against my cultures and believes .. But hey , it 's the world of art .. ! ! the beginning of the film is very strong , strange and confusing.it's hard to understand the contents which make me respect the one who made it.only someone who is extremely opened can do such daring film .. it 's absolutely not for kids .. even though the characters are cute and adorable but they go through some disturbing adventures that can not be erased(sorry if the spelling is wrong)from ones memory ..
neg	I was aware of Rohmer 's admiration for the late works of the ones he considered like great cineasts , and that normal spectators generally considered as artistic failures ( as Renoir 's or Chaplin 's very last movies ; yes , the " politique des auteurs " also has its dark side ) . But with " Les amours d'Astrée et de Céladon " , it 's as if Rohmer himself wanted , for what may be his last movie , to perpetuate this tradition of great directors , who made a last senile movie , by adapting Urfé 's " L'astrée " , with ridiculous aesthetic codes , witch just look like a parody of Rosselini 's last movies ( the ones he made for TV from Descartes or Marx 's lives ) . In his version of " Perceval " , Rohmer refused to film real landscapes in order to give a re - transcription of what may have been a middle age classical representation of things . The director apparently changed his mind when the XVII century is involved , and films actors , dressed like 1600 's peasants reciting their antic text surrounded by contemporary trees and landscapes . But the all thing looks even more ridiculous than Luchini and its fake trees . It 's not that the story itself is stupid , but the way Rohmer mixes naturalism with artifices seems so childish and amateurism that it rapidly becomes involuntarily funny ( and I 'm not even talking about the irritating pronunciation of the actors , the annoying and sad humorist tries by Rodolphe Pauly , the ridiculous soft - erotic tone , the poor musical tentatives , or the strange fascination for trasvestisment ! ) . The radical aesthetic of the film ultimately makes it looks like a joke , which mixes a soft - erotic movie made for TV with theological scholastic discussions ( sic ! ) . At the beginning of the movie , Rohmer teaches us that the original french region of the story is now disfigured by modernity , and that 's why he had to film " L'Astrée " in other parts of the country . However , I 'm sure the movie would have look more modern and interesting , if Rohmer would have actually still filmed the same story in a modern area with same narrative codes and artistically decisions . This film may interest a few historians , but most of the cinephiles may laugh at this last and sad Rohmer 's movie .
pos	Fay Grim is a true example of what I call a completed puzzle film . It has all the pieces of acting , direction , storyline , and entertainment value . They all fit together and when done so create a masterpiece , Fay Grim . This film follows a single mother Fay Grim trying to raise her son to not grow up to be her father who ran away from the law and went missing . Soon the CIA contacts Fay in desperate pursuit to find 8 journals of her husband Henry 's . These journals were filled with confessions of his long past in the CIA and his involvement with countries and their government doings . Fay is sent to find these journals , in return to release her brother from prison , and is sent on a cat - and - mouse chase all over Europe to recover these journals and learn of the hidden secrets of her husbands past she never knew about . Parker Posey had already been an actress I liked after I watched her in The OH in Ohio and Best in Show . She brought liveliness to these two comedic roles of hers , but Fay Grim was a far different role than the other two movies . Posey made me believe what was happening on screen , I felt for her , I rooted for her , and I wanted to know more . She grabs you while she is on screen and when she is off you ca n't stop thinking about what is happening to her . I have n't seen any other previous works by writer / director Hal Hartley but I believe I will look into viewing some of his earlier films if they are half as good as Fay Grim was . If you decide to make a smart movie choice next time you decide to rent a movie or purchase a DVD I 'd highly urge you to choose Fay Grim . If you have any common sense on how a film should be you will enjoy this movie immensely .
neg	... from this awful movie ! There are so many things wrong with this film , acting , writing , direction , editing , etc . that it 's amazing that something rises to the top and proves itself to be the absolute worst . The music ! I noted that the film has two composers listed . This must be the reason why every single frame has music , of the absolute worst " D " movie style drivel . They have never heard of the expression " less is more " . It got so painful to listen to , I muted the sound every time there was no dialogue , not that the dialogue was that good . You have to feel sorry for Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley , I 'm sure they did n't see roles like this in the twilight of their careers . See it at your own risk .
pos	Back in 1997 , do I remember that year : Clinton bans cloning research , the unfortunate death of Princess Diana , the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets . This was also the big year in the release of Titanic , one of the biggest films of all time : a tale about the ship of dreams , about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster . I do n't think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was , the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans , 85 % of them being teenage girls , I was 12 years old at the time , and of course saw the movie multiple times . It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful . At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong , of course I grew up and did n't watch the film since I was 14 , a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now . Was it worth the hype ? Was it really the best movie of all time ? Was that Leonardo 's real nose ? OK , I know that 's silly to say , but I did re - watch the film . Being completely honest here , Titanic is a great movie , best movie of all time , no , just depends on your idea of a good movie , but Titanic delivered in romance , humor , disaster , emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage . The film starts with Brock Lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the RMS Titanic , searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean . Unsuccessful , they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude , wearing the Heart of the Ocean , dated the day the Titanic sank . 101-year - old Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing , and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing . She and her granddaughter Elizabeth " Lizzy " Calvert visit Lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship . When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace , Rose Calvert recalls her memories aboard the Titanic , revealing for the first time that she was Rose DeWitt Bukater . In 1912 , the upper - class 17-year - old Rose boards the ship with her fiancé , Cal Hockley and her mother , Ruth DeWitt Bukater , both of whom stress the importance of Rose 's engagement to Cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the Dewitt - Bukater debts : while they have the outward appearance of the upper - class , Rose and her mother are financially broke . Distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling Cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage , Rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern . Before she leaps , a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes . Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life , and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching ; their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy first - class formal dinner of the rapport - building wealthy for a much livelier gathering of Irish dance , music and beer in third - class . But after Cal 's servant informs him of Rose 's whereabouts ' , Rose is forbidden from seeing Jack again . However , after witnessing a woman encouraging her seven - year - old daughter to behave like a " proper lady " at tea , Rose defies him and her mother , asking Jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the Heart of the Ocean , an engagement present from Cal . After a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time , they go to the deck of the ship . They then witness the ship 's fatal collision with an iceberg . After overhearing the ship 's lookouts discussing how serious the collision is , Rose tells Jack they should warn her mother and Cal . Meanwhile , Cal discovers Rose 's nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe , so he frames Jack for stealing the Heart of the Ocean by having Lovejoy plant it in Jack 's pocket . Upon learning Cal intends to leave Jack to die below deck , Rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him . Jack and Rose return to the top deck . Cal and Jack , though enemies , both want Rose safe , so they persuade her to board a lifeboat . But after realizing that she can not leave Jack , Rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with Jack in the ship 's first class staircase . Jack and Rose return to the top deck , the lifeboats have gone , and the ship finally goes down into the freezing Atlantic taking Jack and Rose down . So does Titanic live up to it 's hype ? I still say that this is a great movie to watch , I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie . But it has great acting , amazing effects , a well - written story and still looks flawless . Love it or hate it , you have to admit this movie did n't get a lot of hype just because of Leo 's baby face or Kate 's amazing ability to cry on sight , this film is something special . It will always hold a special place in my heart , it has too seeing that I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released . But all that aside , I do recommend this movie , it 's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day . 10/10
neg	This is really terrible . The only redeeming feature about this movie is that the next time people ask me what is the worst vampire movie I have ever watched , I would have a suitable reply . I think it is filmed on 35 mm so it is already tacky like hell . I would n't have bothered commenting but I noticed some fanboys ( probably connected to the movie ) had claimed that this was the best movie since the Matrix . Let me debunk the myths and lies . There is nothing good in the movie . Everything yells tacky . The actress is ugly . The fight choreography is the worst I have ever seen . The fight scenes are unbelievably amateurish . Imagine a girl flailing her arms around in a circle helplessly and delivering weak kicks which would n't hurt a kitten . Obviously , the director just pulled people off the street to give them roles in the movie . I know the director did not have much budget for the movie but still better movies have been made on smaller budget before . Unforgivable .
pos	Leon was fantastic as always , this time playing Little Richard in his early years . The movie showed a fully fleshed out Little Richard without neglecting to fill the show with lots of great music . My only complaint is that the ending was a little abrupt - I was hoping for a 2-parter !
neg	Just think , it cost a total of $ 250,000 to make " Clerks " . How the hell did they spend $ 45 Million to make this glorified music video ? A practically unknown cast , two or three sets , no special effects that I could see ... I know , it must have been spent on that expertly crafted , economical , tension filled screenplay . Shoot , that bar set must have cost a bundle . Anyway , I guess Jerry Bruckheimer would n't be caught dead producing anything for less . I 'm just surprised he did n't blow up anything . Anyway , it was n't an awful film I guess . The female leads seemed to have some good chemistry and the soundtrack was OK . IMO It just seems a pity that this rather mediocre project could have been made for $ 5 Million without any loss to the production , and 6 more $ 5 million dollar indy films of merit could have been made as well .
pos	I have to agree with MR . Caruso Jr Lanza , s was the finest voice god had to offer if only he could have found the courage to go for broke leave Hollywood and head for the opera he could have been the American Caruso everyone says he could have been but in any case he is a fantastic introduction to the art form no bones about it and if that s the way its gon na be so be it . see the film you 'll see why Mr Lanza still come up in discussion even in my house . Someone says Pavarotti i say MARIO LANZA.As for the film itself when will it be on DVD they must have it restored and VHS is n't good enough but this should also be the only Lanza film put on DVD the others are down right bad and boring .
neg	Written by Stephen King , but this treatment is not as solid as most of his stories on film . A mother and son move into a small Indiana town with a secret . They are Sleepwalkers , feline type creatures that feed on young virgins . This little story has its share of gore and special effects ; plus hints of incest . Alice Krige is outstanding as the mother . Others appearing are Madchen Amick , Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett . Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker . Stephen King cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery .
pos	The often misunderstood Zabriskie Point is Antonioni 's political film , Antonioni 's American film . Stylistically , it follows suit after " Blow - Up " , meaning that the pace is faster than the previous epics , though certainly no less idiosyncratic . Basically the common mistake is that the film glorifies the hippie generation . Not so . The two protagonists come from vastly different environments . Mark from the " rebel " youths , Daria from an estate agency corporation . But in true Antonioni fashion , they are both alienated , both trying to escape their surroundings . Mark leaves a meeting of rebel students and Black Panthers disappointed with the verbose empty rhetoric , while Daria keeps uneasily being on the move with her car . Antionioni , the master director , after portraying the rebelling youth as confused and shallow , then moves to the city . An environment saturated by corporatism , billboard advertisements , meaninglessness , that has to keep expanding to accommodate the similar expansion of the population , generating a profit at the same time . It is this environment that the two protagonists escape from , though it seems mostly out of coincidence . Indeed , when Daria stops by a small village in the outskirts of the desert , the environment is just as suffocating , and the people just as lost cases , best exemplified by an old boxing champion , now reduced to a shadow of himself , sitting around drinking and smoking and talking nonsense . A stunning melancholy sequence , made even more powerful with the inclusion of some half wild children living around , brought in by some " benefactor " but " destroying a genuine piece of American history " . In a not - so - obscure symbolism , there is Antonioni 's opinion on the hippies . Just a half - positive glimpse in the canvas of human alienation . And then there is the desert , the landscape used to devastating effect , by turns pure and terrifying , primeval , wild and dead . The sequence where the two protagonists make love , " joined " in fantasy by the " flower " generation reflects the similar sequence in " Red Desert " , where Giuliana tells her son a story . It is a colourful intermission in a colourless landscape . A vivid half - fantasy in a suffocating reality . The ending probably belongs to the pantheon of great endings in cinema , the Western civilization blown to pieces . A catharsis , an exorcism . Antionioni 's two " international " films ( the British " Blow - Up " and the American " Zabriskie Point " ) are lesser efforts than the previous masterpieces , but that is largely because of the faster pace and the inevitably contrived settings ( swinging London , flower - power America ) . But when it comes down to it , it 's clear he has n't lost the edge .
neg	Vovochka is your everyday hooligan vs authority movie . Vovochka , the main character , is branded early as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood . With the words of wisdom from a couple of grownups he meets along the way , he finds changing his mischievous ways hard , yet worthy of doing . Personally , I found actor who played Vovochka too annoying to sympathize with , however the change of tone of the movie would allow most to feel the emotional struggle Vovochka has when he wants to be good but bad things still happen . This struggle makes the movie a little different than other movies of the same genre , that 's the little flavor I meant . All in all , I did not really care for this movie , although it was most likely aimed for a younger audience .
pos	i 'm not even sure what to say about this film . it 's one of only a handful of movies ever made that i would consider romantic . to try to talk plot or performance or technical details about this film would be in the words of frank zappa " like dancing about architecture " . it absolutely hits the nail right on the head in the way it captures those fleeting moments in life that move us and then run away from us never to be experienced again . this seems like the movie the character version of charlie kaufman in the movie Adaptation wanted to write . the ending is left open and ambiguous , no happy ending here , just mystery . no profound life lessons , just a couple of horny and intelligent kids exploring the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic of feelings ...... romantic love . 10 out of 10 watch it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger ................
neg	Eh , not a particular good slasher flick . So - so acting , effects , decent yet familiar and uninventive soundtrack . There are three deaths in close succession near the beginning of the movie that make for a fairly good scene in which it would seem anything goes . Apart from that , there 's a lot of characters wandering around , not realizing what 's going on , or chasing after red herrings ; more killing of time , than of people . There are other deaths , and the killer is an equal opportunity murderer , not partial to any one implement . The killer also likes to set other people up to kill innocent people as well . The identity is n't revealed towards the end , and motive is pretty thin , and we really do n't care . Supposedly the movie takes place around Christmas , but this is n't a major factor . One scene gets lit by Christmas lights , that 's about it . The movie is rather dark with a muddy picture most of the time , at least on the videotape I watched . Some of the dialog got a little lost in some of the opening scenes . The ending should have been stronger than it was . We think we realize what happened , although there 's a chance something else did .
pos	Man , some of you people have got to chill . This movie was artistic genius . Instead of searching for reasoning or messages to justify it in your reality , why ca n't you understand that it is a work of fiction ? A story . Entertainment , for God 's sake ( no pun intended ) . It seems to me that too many of the people on here are trying to be movie critics -- and they 're not doing to well . I 'm so impressed by the movie and Bill Paxton 's job at directing , that I 'm going to contact him personally to tell him . Ya know , if you were n't trying to analyze the heck out of the possibility of the story line , you might just enjoy the film . Me and all of my friends did !
neg	In a far away Galaxy is a planet called Ceta . It 's native people worship cats . But the dog people wage war upon these feline loving people and they have no choice but to go to Earth and grind people up for food . This is one of the stupidest f#@k!ng ideas for a movie I 've seen . Leave it to Ted Mikels to make a movie more incompetent than the already low standard he set in previous films . It 's like he enjoying playing in a celluloid game of Limbo . How low can he go ? The only losers in the scenario are US the viewer . Mr. Mikels and his silly little handlebar mustache actually has people who STILL buy this crap . My Grade : F   DVD Extras : Commentary by Ted Mikels ; the Story behind the Making of ( 9 and a half minutes ) ; 17 minutes , 15 seconds of Behind the scenes footage ; Ted Mikels filmography ; and Trailers for " The Worm Eaters " " Girl in Gold Boots " , " the Doll Squad " , " Ten Violent Women " ( featuring nudity ) , " Blood Orgy of the She Devils " , & " the Corpse Grinders "
pos	The Journey of Hope ( 1990 ) is about a trek that many nomadic and poor Turks make so they could live the good life in Switzerland . These people are so desperate to live like Westerners that they 'll give up their life and lives in an attempt to reach the promised land . So many of them are swindled by greedy crooks who make their living off of charging huge fees for desperate people who are in a no win situation . One family braves the cold , the treacherous mountain range and predatory criminals only to discover that there 's not always a shining white light at the end of the tunnel . This problem exists world wide , not just in America . Some people tend to forget that . A heart breaker of a film that 'll leave you wondering why at the end . Highly recommended .
neg	Whether you watch the regular version of this monstrosity or the MST3 K version , you can only be impressed by the utter GALL that went into this production . The filmmakers insult the viewer 's intelligence from one end to the other and obviously could n't care less that they are doing so . Everything about it is rock - bottom cheap . Even the 1950s car in the flashback sequence to that era looks like it was hauled out of a junkyard . The " hobgoblins " are , as you probably know , " realized " with badly - crafted hand puppets and stuffed toys ; when a person is supposed to be attacked by them , it 's clear the toy is being held by the victim to his or her own body . When the critters scurry away from the two security guards , this is shown ( or rather , not shown ) by the camera aiming UP at the guards as they look down and turn their heads as if watching the hobgoblins scurrying past . It 's reminiscent of the scene in the film " Tangents " where two people are standing in the ruins of a future world , surveying the wreckage , and we are n't shown any of it . Budget constraints alloyed with utter incompetence generally mean you wo n't have anything worth showing , so why try ? The " sets " were utterly laughable . " Club Scum " was an obvious diner ; the house appears to have been a vacant house --probably for rent or sale-- which the production company got hold of for an hour or two to do the shoot . The " spacecraft " is something I would have been ashamed to build when I was a model - making 10 year - old . The motivations of the characters make no sense-- Kevin gets denigrated by his worthless ingrate of a girlfriend because he has n't made her " proud of him . " I 'm sure this was intended to make their reconciliation oh so touching at the end , but any guy with real self - respect would have told her to go to hell and left her . Nick is supposedly back from 2 months of Army training ( yeah , nice regulation haircut , Nick , ) and seems bent on proving that our country is being defended by sadistic , moronic animals who are sex maniacs . Kyle is a phone - sex freak in red shorts who dreams of a night with a spandex - clad dominatrix type , but he 's so effeminate that he 's more likely gay than not . One of the girls is a prude and the other is a sleaze . And the hobgoblins ? At the end they all head back to the vault where they 've lived for 30 years . Why ? Who knows ? Who cares ? Watch this film and be amazed at how primitive film - making in our modern age can be when you have an idiotic script , incompetent direction , actors who are so bad they 'd be rejected from a high school theater production , and sets worthy of Edward D. Wood , Jr.
pos	If TV was a baseball league , this show would have a perfect record ! With an excellent cast , and a perfect plot , this show gave 8 amazing seasons and a great joy to TV after dinner . With the constant changing of relationships and finding out who Hyde 's real dad is , this show was a hit when it started in August of 98 , though it was set in 1976 . And hanging out in Foremans basement was always the thing to do back then , and it still is today , along with circles . This show gave great laughs in premieres , and it still does during re - runs . If you watch a few episodes of this show , you will get everything and want to get more . Now only is this show one of the best ever created , it is clever and funny .
neg	Beautiful attracts excellent idea , but ruined with a bad selection of the actors . The main character is a loser and his woman friend and his friend upset viewers . Apart from the first episode all the other become more boring and boring . First , it considers it illogical behavior . No one normal would not behave the way the main character behaves . It all represents a typical Halmark way to endear viewers to the reduced amount of intelligence . Does such a scenario , or the casting director and destroy this question is on Halmark producers . Cat is the main character is wonderful . The main character behaves according to his friend selfish .
pos	Some movies you just know you 're going to love from the first few seconds . This is one of those movies . Tracing it 's roots back to " Double Indemnity , " and " The Postman Always Rings Twice " in the 40 's - this was a great example of Modern Film Noir in the 90 's . Nick Cage plays the " down on his luck " main character who gets entangled in a husband - wife murder plot - and his luck goes from bad to worse to even worse as he tries and tries to get away from the people , town , violence and threat of Red Rock West . Lots of twists and turns , great performances by Cage , Hopper and Walsh , an hypnotic slide - guitar musical backdrop , and seamless directing make this a real joy . Favorite Line : When Cage looks at the empty gas gauge in the get - away car , shakes his head and says : " F***in ' story of my life . "
neg	As some other comments show , this movie might scare you , when you 're a little child . ( And that is probably all that it is good for . ) However , if you 're older , this movie only does one thing : suck majorly -and thereby I do n't mean the acting , its soundtrack , cutting or s.th . like that . I 'm simply talking about the " plot " ( if you can call it that ) .   SPOILERS ahead ------------------------ I do n't want to give any more spoilers than necessary ( if after reading this , you really still want to watch this movie ) but if you graduated from any school , this is just a big insult of your intelligence . When watching this , I was stunned most of the time , because what was happening was just THAT stupid . This includes : -the forming of UNITE ( an evil UN - association )   -- > we are just supposed to believe it 's evil . is it even evil at all ? if so : why is it evil ? -the mark of evil in the form of a tattoo   -- > there is no necessity to impose this on the people , so why the hell ( no pun intended ) are they doing it ?   -inviting Christ to your heart merely as lip service   -->because there 's nothing anybody , who in this movie is considered " a real Christian " , ever does , besides saying that stupid prayer . so ... just say that prayer before the rapture and you 're saved - no matter what ? !   Thus , rating 1/10
pos	Musings : Pure delight from beginning to end . Not a laugh riot , but a more subtle , sophisticated humor . What a goldmine of great scenes and character actors , including Reginald Denny , Nestor Paiva , Ian Wolfe , Harry Shannon and Jason Robards Sr ..   Cary Grant is at the building sight of his new home , which is at that point , being framed . A young carpenter , played by future Tarzan Lex Barker , asks him if he wants his " lallies to be rabbeted " , or some such thing that only a carpenter would know . Grant , not wanting to appear ignorant , replies in the affirmative . At that , Barker yells up to his mates , " OK boys , he wants 'em rabbeted , so .... YANK ' EM OUT ! " A second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about 20 big nails being pulled out of various boards . All Grant can do is moan . Yes , the movie IS dated . You 'd never see that many carpenters working at once on a single family home , and a place like that , in Connecticut of all places , would probably run a few million bucks . A classic movie that is really a treasure .
neg	Let this film serve as the death knell to the " big twist " films borne out of the 1990s . Known in some circles as The Kyser Soze Syndrome , this cinematic slight of hand has now been done to death by M. Night Shayamalan and even Ron Howard used a variation in A BEAUTIFUL MIND . However , in REVOLVER , director Guy Ritchie ( known in some circles as " Mr. Madonna " ) , utilizes the Soze motif in a far more obsequious manner .   Jason Statham ( with a highly questionable head of hair ) stars as Jack Green ( known to all as " Mr. Green . " ) He may or may not also be criminal mastermind Mr. Gold . Or , perhaps Mr. Gold is an irritable spirit who can possess members of the underworld . I 'm not quite certain , but I certainly do n't care . REVOLVER is one of the most overwrought examples of cinematic excess I 've had the displeasure to endure in quite a long time . Witness the fractured time structure , the painful jump cuts , the ceaseless inner - monologues , and the painfully pretentious animated sequence . This " everything and the kitchen sink " directing style makes Quentin Tarantino 's oeuvre look sedate . The cinematic smoke and mirrors only lead me to believe that Ritchie was as bored telling this trite tale as I was watching it . The film is filled with moments of revelation that are supposedly shocking but they only come as news to Mr. Green . I wanted to like Green as I always enjoy Stratham as a character who is two steps ahead of everyone else . Here , though , he struggles along like a remedial reader in a University English Literature class . His lack of wit is only matched by the lack of restraint shown by his nemesis , Macha ( Ray Liotta ) . Feasting on scenery like a starving man at a smorgasbord , Liotta spits , cries , and fumes through the film in an embarrassing display of overacting and leopard print speedos .   There are no redeeming qualities to REVOLVER . It 's yet another filmic faux pas from Ritchie and might even outdo his wretched remake of SWEPT AWAY as his worst film yet .
pos	The first installment of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and set up like an amateur camcorder tape , complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame . It presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black - clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her . The hapless victim is beaten savagely and pelted with raw meat before having her fingernails pulled out with pliers , her hand smashed with a hammer , her eye punctured with a needle , and so forth . In the most nauseating scene , the woman 's captors burn her with hot water and drop live maggots into the burns . The series received a great deal of publicity when American actor Charlie Sheen , believing the series to contain actual murder , attempted to ban its distribution in the United States . An FBI investigation revealed that the films were only what they appeared to be to most viewers -- sick re - creations using nasty , but obvious special effects . Gruesomely staged by acclaimed Japanese comic - book artist Hideshi Hino , who also directed the third and fourth episodes , this film is a sure way to clear all but the most tolerant of rooms . But , gorehounds probably wo n't find anything special .
neg	How this film was made with so many big stars is beyond me . This is a terrible cliché ' ridden film with the worst acting any of these actors have ever done . It really surprises me that so many of these A list stars would agree to this unfunny film . What 's even worse is the fact that is made almost 100 million here in the states . It does go to show however that big stars can pull in the bucks , even if the film is terrible . I felt sorry for everyone involved in this snore - fest . Billy Crystal tried his best with the what he was given and the rest of the stars seemed to be walking through the motions . Whatever you do , do n't fall for the excellent cast because no one could have saved this .
pos	If you have not seen this excellent movie about life in the 90s ( in L.A. ) then you 've missed a special treat . This is one of the most amazingly and most powerful movies ever made about life for Americans in the 90s and it even carries over into today 's world in which we live in . It covers everything from raising a child , prejudice ( more than one way),love , adultery , empty nest syndrome , selfishness , etc .. and the list goes on . This story builds up to an ultimate climax and then when nothing else matters it always goes back to love with friends and family and love of life . It helps us dig deep within ourselves and to make us search for what we want out of life . Makes us ask questions of ourselves . Have we done enough for others , are we like this , etc . ? ? ? Sit back and enjoy a wonderfully done and emotional movie that I 'm sure others will enjoy for a lifetime . Take note of Mary Mcdonnell , Kevin Kline and Danny Glover 's wonderful performance through this whole film . These actors are amazing and really show the true glow and meaning of what message is being sent to all of us . These are 3 of my favorite actors for life after seeing this film over 10 years ago now . I still enjoy it again and again . Also enjoy the wonderful soundtrack with it and do n't forget to count how many times you see the helicopter fly by and try to figure out it 's symbolism for the movie??hmmm ... I almost forgot this is probably Steve Martin 's very first serious acting role in any film he has ever done . He , too does an excellent job in this movie . This may come as a surprise to most of you . Sit back , relax and enjoy truly good film making .....
neg	Chesty gringo Telly Savalas ( as Frank Cooper ) is a US - Mexico " Border Cop " . He serves as a father figure to young immigrant Danny De La Paz ( as Benny Romero ) , who wants Mr. Savalas to be best man at his impending wedding . Savalas is tough , but boss Eddie Albert ( as Commander Moffat ) may be tougher . Tough is what you need to stop smuggler Michael V. Gazzo ( as Chico Suarez ) . Alliances may be in flux . If you find the possibility of hearing " Kojak " and " Oliver Douglas " uttering expletives to be repulsive , you ought to steer clear of " The Border " . If not , you may not have the stomach for the " realistic " cow slaughtering scene . Although it does n't end up being worth much , Mr. De La Paz and Cecilia Camacho ( as Leina ) steal the show .   * * The Border ( 1979 ) Tony Richardson ~ Telly Savalas , Danny De La Paz , Eddie Albert
pos	I saw this movie Sunday afternoon . I absolutely loved this movie . I loved everything about it , from the sappy moments of mothers and daughters to the scenes where Mamie Gummer ( Lila ) is crying because of her poor decision in marrying a man for her parents and not because she is truly in love . I loved these moments because they were just so real . At first I was seriously scared because I was hoping that it would not end up like Bobby , which was a great cast but a poorly written movie with no real meat to it . But during the middle of the movie i felt completely different . You will laugh and you will cry but in the end you will want to see Evening one more time . Trust me when i say GO SEE IT !
neg	This movie looked as if it might be good at the beginning , but never fleshed out to it 's expectations . The director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas ( typical of the Asian directors ) , but does n't know how to create or tell a good story to go along with it . The story was fragmented and seemed to go off in all sorts of different directions throughout the film , never finding a solid , explainable , interesting angle . Basically , the movie never fit the explanation on the press releases . The acting was very good , however . All the actors gave good performances , and Jude Law was outstanding as he is always is . It is too bad he chose to do such a weak film .
pos	My favorite Jackie Chan movie will always be " Drunken Master " ( 1978 ) , followed by this film from 1985 , " Police Story . " In it , Chan plays a Hong Kong super - cop who busts a notorious crime lord and his gang , and is then assigned to protect the man 's girlfriend ( Brigitte Lin ) so that she can turn state 's evidence . As the story goes on , the gangster sends his goons to dispatch Lin , but Chan takes matters into his own fists and feet , while keeping girlfriend Maggie Cheung at bay . Like " Drunken Master , " " Police Story " has many of the signature stunts and over - the - top martial arts / action choreography that Chan has become famous for , climaxing in a battle royal at a crowded shopping mall . In his role as director , Chan exceeds in excellence , giving a charismatic and funny performance that accentuates the action . While light on the overall slapstick humor of " Drunken Master , " at heart " Police Story " is just that , a police story , a gritty cop - thriller that would be oft - copied over the years to come . 10/10
neg	Strummer 's hippie past was a revelation , but overall this felt like crashing a wake . Campfire stories work best around the intimacy of a campfire . There were just too many semi - boring old friends anecdotes and too much filler stock footage . I love The Clash and Joe for not reuniting and selling their songs until now ( FU Mick Jones ) , but this doc left me wanting .. to relate more . Using campfire storytellers without proper explanation of who is telling the anecdote alienates the viewer to some extent . They should have been interviewed on their own . Even using Strummer 's ' radio DJ voice ' did little to glue the film together . And can someone explain all the flags flying behind the campfire scenes ? After the awesome " Filth And The Fury " I hoped Temple could deliver . A Joe Strummer doc deserves better .
pos	After you 've seen this small likable and comical film , you will for sure feel better . Cheer to Yves B. Pelletier to have given birth to this small magnificent movie moment , that according to me , will be recognized as a marking movie of year 2004 for the Quebec . The actors Isabelle Blais , Emmanuel Bilodeau , Sylvie Moreau and Stéphane Gagnon all deliver a touching performance . I would compare the feeling that this wonderful story gives you to the ones that Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain have given me . So if you 've like the Jean - Pierre Jeunet magnificent film , I would say that you should also like the first movie from Yves B. Pelletier , Les Aimants
neg	" The Rainmaker " released in 1956 - has some of the finest actors of its time . Katharine Hepburn , Lloyd Bridges , and Burt Lancaster being the principle players . Not even they can save this completely over acted melodrama . First of all , Hepburn is horribly miscast as a shy spinster - despite her brilliance as an actress , not even she can pull this off . She is too strong to be credible as being this much of a simpleton , and was just too old for the part . Lancaster over acts to the extreme , and Earl Holliman is way too hammy and comes off more like Jethro Clampett . Only Bridges and the ever reliable Wendell Corey seem to rise above the cast a bit - but even they can only do so much . It seems like the 1950 's was a time when Katharine Hepburn wanted to spread her wings a bit as an actress , and that is fine . She just made a bad choice here . Fortunately for her fans ( me being among them ) she did n't make too many of them . Despite an A - list cast and good production values , it does n't work .
pos	Secret Sunshine marks the return of director Lee Changdong to the film - making world after a multi - year absence . Having three critically acclaimed films already under his belt , he recruits now veteran thespian Jeon Doyeon and her considerable ( Cannes - winning ) talents for the primary role of Lee Shinae . What follows is a journey through one woman 's tragedy and an exploration of her coping mechanisms . One of the things that becomes apparent while watching Secret Sunshine is that it does n't really care to follow any specific genre , but rather picks up genre traits when necessary to convey what it 's trying to convey . The story itself follows Lee Shinae as she moves with her son to the city of Milyang ( whose Sino - Corean translates to Secret Sunshine ) . She moves to Milyang in the aftermath of the death of her husband as it was his hometown , so the film is born from tragedy . And you think things might just get better as she opens up a piano shop and encounters a bit of a bumbling nice - guy mechanic Jongchan ( played by Song Kangho ) . But this is n't a romantic comedy . As we ( and Jongchan , doggedly ) follow Shinae as she encounters Milyang and the fate that it has in store for her , the cracks in her armor quickly become apparent . She is a troubled woman trying to grasp onto her own strength to overcome tragedy and we watch as she finds that it 's not enough . Secret Sunshine still manages to follow a mostly Aristotelian dramatic arc , but pulls back on the catharsis , which might confound some viewers , especially the ending , but the novelistic symbolism present in the name of Milyang , the discussions of sunshine and the imagery used in the film very well left me satisfied , once I started to think over the film some more . Ms. Jeon is rather impressive throughout , especially considering that if the role were any less well played , it would 've quickly turned into a rather painful melodrama , but she captures the nuances of Shinae 's attempts to deal with her losses with a layer of subtlety . Mr. Song has a much smaller role in this film than other films , but he performs adequately , appropriately giving stage to Ms. Jeon . Technically , the film is well done in a classical sense . No flashy aesthetics are employed here -- the director is clearly trying to let the story tell itself . I think my only real complaint , and one that might not be able to be fixed , is that despite all the time we spend with Shinae , there is a bit of distance between Shinae and the audience ( or at least , me ) . I think some of this stems from the nature of the work , because if total empathy were pushed , then we would n't be able to see the problems that Shinae has objectively . On the other hand , I never felt moved along with Shinae 's plight , despite her many tears and increasingly erratic behavior . All the same , the film still stands quite impressive , especially in that it stimulated me to think about it , the further meanings present in it and its ruminations on tragedy , coping , self - deception , isolation and faith stuck with me well after the credits had finished running . Propelled by a strong lead performance , I honestly did n't notice its 2.25 hour runtime . And that says something . Well done . 8/10 .
neg	Not much to say beyond the summary , save that this is an example of J. Edgar 's Hoover 's constant attention to maintaining a good " PR " profile . They do n't make movies this bad very often , especially with the likes of Jimmy Stewart and Vera Miles in the blend . Too bad .  
pos	" Creep " is a new horror film that , without a doubt , will please many genre fans simply because it 's so down to the point and unscrupulous ! It has many genuine shock - moments , a whole lot of repulsive gore - sequences and a rare claustrophobic tension . What it has n't got is logic and a solid plot but , to tell you the truth , that did n't bother me for one second . When the end - credits start to roll , there are still many unanswered questions to ponder on but director / writer Christopher Smith ( in his debut ) seemly preferred to fully focus on tension and adrenalin - rushing action instead of long , soporific speeches and theories that could explain the existence of the " creep " in the London subway . The story revolves on the young and haughty Kate , who leaves her own party in order to go and meet the famous actor George Clooney who 's in town to present his new film . She falls asleep in the subway , misses the last train and she finds herself trapped in the underground subway network . Things really get terrifying when she encounters a mad - raving lunatic who lives in the old tunnels and kills / kidnaps people to experiment upon . Even experienced homeless people , security guards or sewer - workers ca n't rescue her from this ravenous monster ! I really dug the creep - character ! He 's nauseating , hideous and primitive but in a strange way fascinating . Christopher Smith only leaves us clues and hints , and it 's merely up to the viewer to guess this vile creature 's origin and background . I reckon this is n't very original , and I 'm sure many people wo n't appreciate the lack of content , but I forgive Smith and I think it 's better this way than going over the top completely , " Jeepers Creepers "- style ( that particular film started out great as well , but as soon as the Creeper 's identity was clear it turned into a very mediocre horror effort ) . The obvious aspect - to - love is the outrageous gore ! There 's some severe butchering going on in this film and the make - up , as well as the sound effects , are very convincing . The ominous setting of the abandoned London subway during night is effectively used . There also is some acting - talent present in this film , with Franka Potenta ( Run Lola Run ) returning to graphic horror nearly five years after the cool German film " Anatomie " . Creep is terrific entertainment when you 're in an undemanding mood and Christopher Smith definitely is a director I 'll keep an eye on . Make sure you do n't have to take the subway right after watching this film ...
neg	-=contains spoiler from both original and movie versions=- i am a huge fan of Notre dame De Paris musical , i also read book this summer and i watched movie today , in the beginning i was hopeful to watch a good film especially when i saw 6.3 IMDb point.first scenes were good but i actually waited for , theaters scene directly from book , but it was normal but when Esmeralda kisses gringoire i felt something is wrong .. they do n't even kiss in book , even in musical .. and there were huge gap why Esmeralda being judged by sorcerer , in the book she teaches her goat how to respond numbers of clock or write word " phoebus " .. wait there were a phoebus were n't there ? in this movie he is some soldier junk nothing more , the creators made Quasimodo 's love to show around and they even canceled Frollo 's love .. but Notre dame was frollo . his thoughts his struggles between love of god and love of human in movie we ca nt find anything like that all we have is , some villain who is really bad and kills people whose clashes with his thoughts .. and not mentioning phoebus , not mentioning love of frollo , not mentioning jehan ( brother of frollo ) not mentioning mother of Esmeralda ( maybe it is OK , the storyline would have chopped much)they even not mentioned the real story .. ( another PS : frollo was n't a opus dei or some cult member he actually in interest with alchemy he tries to make gold .. he was stuck in science and religion ) finally do n't watch this movie , it is some kind of directors edition to real masterpiece , and if you have watched it before read the book , god have mercy on you .. you must read to book immediately .. this movie is worse than hunchback of Notre dame II the animated movie , spend your time with watching Notre dame De Paris musical .. enough said ..
pos	Creature Comforts in America should have been released on a different network , or at least been given the chance to have its full run of episodes . Unfortunately , this was not the case . Given that American audiences ( seemingly ) have the attention spans of a gnat when it comes to the humor that does not consist of profanity laced diatribes , or has a preoccupation with scatological functions ( both sound and smells ) , shows like this will be few and far between . One of the main problems was that however brilliant it was , it was made for a rarefied audience who knew what to expect but was viewed by an audience and board rooms that did not have a clue at to what they were watching . Which is sad , but not unexpected . I would have liked to have seen at least three more seasons of this show even if it was produced for direct DVD release . The material and the interactions between the creatures were rich with sub context and there were other conversations just waiting to be had under the surface . But thanks to Political Correctness , such conversations take place only in my mind .
neg	Some people have made a point of dissing this movie because they question the plausibility of black people in the Old West , Asian people in the Old West or women with guns in the Old West period . Get a grip and read a book . There were quite a few Asians ( Chinese ) , there were quite a few blacks ( freedmen ) and everybody outside of the gentile class had ready access to guns ; it is the second amendment you know . And as far as the use of modern language goes , none of those Westerns people have waxed nostalgic about actually used language that was consistent with the era depicted . Americans had different accents , used different inflections , spoke at a very different pace and used plenty of words and phrases that would be unrecognizable today . Do n't blame historical inaccuracy for the fact that you just did n't dig it . Be honest . Maybe you 're just uncomfortable with what you 're seeing .

neg	Spoilers ahead if you want to call them that ... I would almost recommend this film just so people can truly see a 1/10 . Where to begin , we 'll start from the top ... THE STORY : Do n't believe the premise - the movie has nothing to do with abandoned cars , and people finially understanding what the mysterious happenings are . It 's a draub , basic , go to cabin movie with no intensity or " effort " . THE SCREENPLAY : I usually give credit to indie screenwriters , it 's hard work when you are starting out ... but this is crap . The story is flat - it leaves you emotionless the entire movie . The dialogue is extremely weak and predictable boasting lines of " Woah , you totally freaked me out " and " I was wondering if you 'd uh ... if you 'd like to .. uh , would you come to the cabin with me ? " . It makes me want to rip out all my hair , one strand at a time and feed it to myself . THE CHARACTERS : HOLY CRAP ! ! ! ! Some have described the characters as flat , I want to take it one step further and say that they actually have a reverse character arch .. They actually start working on a parallel universe and almost start acting backwards ... THE ACTORS : Worse than the characters are the actors . They take already poor written characters and add in terrible high school drama acting . The " Woah you totally freaked me out " was said so monotone and slow - like it was dumbed down . I could complain for hours on the actors alone . TECHNICAL : LIGHTING : An eight year old would be disappointed with lighting on this movie . Too shadowy in areas , too bleached in others . The director should n't use light as an emotion until he learns how to light a basic scene properly . Baby Steps ! SOUND : How many sound guys does it take to make a really shotty sounding movie ? 9 . With that many sound guys this should sound amazing but quite the opposite has occured . There is one scene in particular that really sticks out , these guys are driving in a car and the sound of the car changes with every camera angle .... WEAK ! CAMERA : Learn to use it . Anyway , I 'm running out of complaining space ..... rent it - I dare you ... Rent it and learn from it ... give it a 1 rating .. it deserves it . Signing off ... Amanda Christmas
pos	The Mother is one of those films that you know is good , maybe even great , but it is like eating vegetables or doing math homework is to a kid - too much work and a whole lot of pain to get invested in . The story is potentially distasteful in many ways : the death of a character within the first half hour , the December - May romance , the idea of a man cheating on his wife and then cheating on his lover with her mother , the collection of weak and rather unpleasant thirty - something characters , the apparent indifference of the adults to the children in their lives . This movie was made in the 2002 or 2003 , but is a throw back to a collection of British ( usually made - for - TV ) movies from the late 1980 's - it has a moral severity that never lets up , which produces an enveloping throbbing angst . The Mother is flawless , but that is in part the problem ; if a film dealing with so many sensitive issues has some flaws - inconsistencies of script , some lesser actors - it takes the edge off , but if such a film is so pitch perfect , the experience of watching it is raw and painful . Even the technical qualities - lighting , editing , etc . - make the viewer ache ; the London in this movie is bright and open , filled with harsh , cutting light . If you are tough as nails , or are one of those super - sensitive people who likes to torture themselves with gut - wrenching sad movies or novels , then you will enjoy The Mother . Anyone in between , give it a miss , or be prepared to squirm . And be warned : as tough as the movie is from beginning to near - end , the worst is to come . Toward the end of the movie , the mother asks her daughter what she can do to make up for it ( for having slept with her boyfriend ) , and the daughter calmly says that she has thought about it and would like to hit her . The mother agrees to this , they both stand up , and - instead of a well primed slap - the daughter clenches her fist and delivers a boxer 's blow . Argh ! ! !
neg	To describe this film as garbage is unfair . At least rooting through garbage can be an absorbing hobby . This flick was neither absorbing nor entertaining . Kevin Bacon can act superbly given the chance , so no doubt had an IRS bill to settle when he agreed to this dire screenplay . The mad scientist story of ' Hollow Man ' has been told before , been told better , and been told without resorting to so many ludicrously expensive special effects . Most of those special effects seem to be built around the transparent anatomical dolls of men , women and dogs you could buy in the early seventies . In the UK they were marketed as ' The Transparent Man ( /Woman / Dog ) ' which is maybe where they got the title for this film . Clever special effects , dire script , non - existent plot .
pos	Like Tarzan the Ape Man ( 1932 ) , only more so . There 's more of everything , more animals , more varied African tribes , and scenes in which the thought must be , if this was good with three or four lions , forty would be better . Tarzan wrestles with crocodilesthe the crocodile machine spins in the water like a rolling pin , around and around , jaws flapping . Tarzan can kill it with his ubiquitous knife if the blasted saurian would hold still . Tarzan kills lions and rhinos and a steadily increasing number of animals . His friends are real chimps , people wearing larger ape costumes , and elephants . In fact , they use Indian elephantsfar more friendly and trainable than African oneswith costume ears attached to their heads . The human story : another white man , worse than the rest , shows up to join with Holt to go after the ivory from the elephant graveyard . Tarzan wo n't show them the way , so the bad guy shoots an elephant so they can follow it to its deathbed . Tarzan intercedes , and the bad guy shoots himbut , of course , he survives and returns to save Jane . Everybody else dies , Holt and the bad guy and every single one of their " boys . " People are expendable , especially Africans , and there does n't seem to be much distinction between the black fellows who die because they work for the white men travelling through taboo country and those black fellows who kill them . This must be the last Tarzan movie before the Hays Code made Jane wear more clothes . There are a number of underwater scenes in which Jane swims nude , and though the light is flickering the movement and the glimpses are very appealing . Apparently one of Weismuller 's friends from the Olympic swim team did the nude scenes , and not Maureen O'Sullivan . She , however , moves through the movie wearing the same sort of loincloth Weismuller wears ( plus a bikini top ) , showing a splendid glimpse of thigh and hip . They still do n't need to talk a lot . They sleep together and hang out with cool animals and stay away from cities . No wonder they 're happy .
neg	I have seen a lot of bad movies with big actors in it . But this movie was terrible . I have yet to see why people thought it was funny . The idea behind it is stupid . Plus all the things that are supposed to be funny are just dumb . Why anyone would want to watch this more than once just baffles me !
pos	' Shock Corridor ( 1963 ) ' was my first film from Samuel Fuller , and there I was impressed with the director 's astute blending of B - movie and big - budget aesthetics , even if the story itself was pure schlock . ' Pickup on South Street ( 1953 ) ' was released a decade earlier in Fuller 's career , obviously produced on a larger budget from a big - name studio , Twentieth Century - Fox . Nevertheless , the visuals are still notable in that there 's a somewhat raw , naturalistic element to the photography , not unlike Dassin 's ' The Night and the City ( 1950 ) ' and Kazan 's ' Panic in the Streets ( 1950 ) ' { the latter was also shot by cinematographer Joe McDonald}. In some scenes , Fuller shoves the camera so close to his actors ' faces that they 're out of focus , bluntly registering the intimate thoughts , emotions and brief inflections that are communicated through that most revealing of facial features , the eye . Though ( unexpectedly ) prone to melodrama , and with just a hint of anti - Communist propaganda , ' Pickup on South Street ' is a strong film noir that succeeds most outstandingly in its evocation of setting  the underground of New York City . When just - out - of - prison pickpocket Skip McCoy ( Richard Widmark ) snags the purse of a woman on the subway ( Jean Peters ) , he pockets more than he 'd originally bargained for . The woman , Candy , and her cowardly ex - boyfriend Joey ( Richard Kiley ) had been smuggling top - secret information to the Communists , and McKoy has unexpectedly retrieved an important roll of micro - film . Will he turn in the MacGuffin to the proper authorities , or sell it to the highest bidder ? If ' Pickup on South Street ' has a flaw , it 's that the story seems designed solely to bolster an anti - Communist agenda , reeking of propaganda like nothing since WWII { Dwight Taylor , who supplied the story , also notably wrote ' The Thin Man Goes Home ( 1944 ) , ' the only propagandistic movie of the series}. For no apparent reason , every identifiable character  even the smugly self - serving Skip McCoy  eventually becomes a self - sacrificing patriot , the transformation predictable from the outset . In traditional film noir , the unapologetic criminal always gets his comeuppance , the rational punishment for his sins , but apparently not when they 've served their country ; patriotism wipes the slate clean . Richard Widmark , an actor who I 'm really beginning to like , plays the haughty pickpocket with composure , though always with that hint of ill - ease that suggests he 's biting off more than he can chew . The opening scene on the train is the film 's finest , as McCoy breathlessly and silently fishes around in his victim 's hand bag , recalling Bresson 's ' Pickpocket ( 1959 ) . ' Thelma Ritter is terrific as a tired street - woman who 'll peddle information to anybody willing to pay for it ( though , of course , she draws the line at Commies ) . Jean Peters is well - cast as the trashy dame passing information to the other side , playing the role almost completely devoid of glamour ; Fuller reportedly cast the actress on the observation that she had the slightly bow - legged strut of a prostitute . Nevertheless , Peters must suffer a contrived love affair with Widmark that really brings down the film 's attempts at realism . Fascinatingly , upon its release , ' Pickup on South Street ' was promptly condemned as Communist propaganda by the FBI , and the Communist Party condemned it for being the exact opposite . Go figure .
neg	I was expecting a movie similar to Deuce Bigalow , which I enjoyed . However , this dud seemed to last forever . It 's one of those flicks which enjoys the sad placement of PG-13 while not being kid appropriate . The jokes are n't just low - brow or f**t jokes , they 're crude , lewd , and many acts cross the boundaries to not only bad taste but beyond legal and moral decency . Many scenes appear to have been chopped to get the PG-13 rating ... too bad ... it might have made a bigger splash as an R - rated film if the funny was left in . ( Overstatement ? Probably . ) I do not recommend this movie . It is a full - on waste of time ... and I 'm a movie lover and ready to give just about anything a shot . At 45 minutes in , the movie felt like it should be winding down ... and boy were we ready for it to . The ending is quaint but does n't salvage the rest of this quagmire / tourist trap of a rental . 1/2 star ( glad I saw it as a freebie ... would have been sickened to pay hard - earned greenbacks for this tripe )
pos	Emory is a Cincinatti steel worker like his father before him and for most of the 20th century the twin pillars of his family 's existence have been the steel mill and the union . The mill , which once employed 45,000 , has seen its numbers dwindle to 5,000 recently and now 1 , as the plant just shut its doors , leaving a single security guard . At first , newly - unemployed Emory and his pals enjoy their independence , hanging out around town and carousing at their favorite bar , where they down " depth charges " with reckless abandon . They think the mill will reopen after listening to their union rep 's optimistic spiel , but reality starts to sink in when they find themselves selling their personal vehicles in a struggle to put food on the table and stave off foreclosure of their homes . Emory 's father - a dedicated union man - is sure the plant will reopen and recalls for his son all the short - lived closures during his own 35 years at the mill . Meanwhile , some of the unemployed men take demeaning make - work jobs or hop in their trucks and take off in a desperate search for employment .   Finally the union admits its helplessness , as Emory explains to his stubborn father that times have changed and that the mill wo n't ever open again . Emory tearfully asks " What did I do wrong ? " as a lifetime of hard work and devotion to job , union , church and family have left him with nothing and nowhere to turn . He hits rock bottom when in a drunken rage he manhandles his young sons and knocks his wife to the floor . Tossed out of his own home and stinging from the plant manager 's comments that he and his men did n't work hard enough to justify their substantial paychecks , Emory recruits the steel workers still left in town to do something that will demonstrate to all what they are capable of . Early in the morning they break into the mill , fire up the furnaces and work harder than they ever have in their lives , producing in one shift enough high - quality steel pipes to fill the loading docks from wall to wall , top to bottom - something the plant manager thought was impossible .   Arriving at the suddenly - reopened plant , the stupefied manager looks around him at the tremendous output that came from a single day 's work , realizing that production like this could make the plant profitable again . The manager asks Emory : " Can you do this every day ? " Emory is forced to nod " No " and the manager asks : " Then what were you trying to prove ? " Emory explains that the workers ' decades of hard work , honesty and devotion to their jobs had meaning and that by showing how much they could produce in one day " We just spit in your eye . " Emory bids a tearful farewell to his wife and kids as he takes off with his buddies to look for work down south , promising to relocate the family when he finds it .   This is a powerful and honest treatment of the plight of American workers displaced by foreign competition and gives a realistic view of the costs they bear for the short - sightedness of concession - demanding unions and greedy plant owners who extracted every penny they could from their factories but never gave back by modernizing them . Peter Strauss as Emory , John Goodman as his best friend , Gary Cole as his college - boy brother , Pamela Reed as Emory 's sympathetic wife and John Doucette as his dying father all turn in excellent performances in this fine picture .
neg	I bought this movie exciting a gloriously gratuitous , over the top , entertaining bloodbath . I got none of them . This film fails on practically every level , not in the least frightening , or funny , it is simply terrible film - making , and never provides the audience with anything worth seeing . What is so bad about it is that far from being as raw , violent and brutal as it had promised to be , there is very little violence at all . Virtually no blood shed , and no excitement whatsoever . Acting , direction and dialogue is absolutely unbearable . Honestly , it is truly laughable . I could hardly sit through this total garbage once ; I certainly will never want to watch it again . Do n't waste your time with a waste of celluloid like this ; it is truly possibly the worst film ever made . If I could give it minus stars , I would .
pos	Overall , I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to indie film lovers . However , I really want to note the similarities between parts of this film and Nichols ' Closer . One scene especially where Adrian Grenier 's character is questioning Rosario Dawson 's about her sex life while he was away is remarkably similar to the scene in Closer where Clive Owen 's character is questioning Julia Roberts , although it is acted with less harshness and intensity in " Love . " Also note that " Anna " is the name of both Dawson 's and Roberts ' character . Ca n't be coincidence . Now Closer is based on Patrick Marber 's play and supposedly this film is loosely based on Arthur Schnitzler 's " Reigen " so I 'm not sure how this connection formed . Anyone have an idea ?
neg	Could this be by the same director as Do n't Look Now or Bad Timing ? Poorly acted , clunkily edited . You only have to compare the various accident scenes in this with similar ones in Do n't Look Now to see how much Roeg has lost his touch . Even the generally reliable Teresa Russell ( looking a bit chunky these days , I 'm afraid to report ) can not save this one . The plot is pure pseudo - religious hokum , the acting is wooden and Roeg 's attempts at his trademark dislocation of time are pitiful . Avoid this one like the plague .
pos	The combination of reading the Novella and viewing this film has inspired my wife and I to new levels . Recently I was pondering a statement made by the artist Thomas Kinkade in one of his inspirational books ; He states : " You and I were not designed to breathe the fetid air of five o'clock traffic . Nor do I think God had banal television programs , media hype , worthless purchases , and soul pollution in mind when he created the universe ... " I had n't seen " A river runs through it " in a couple of years , but after pondering Kinkade 's statement something drew me to watch the film with a spiritual eye . I watched it and saw a whole new world to the film and it inspired me to read the book ( a must read ) . I have always been frustrated in Southern California but somehow got caught up in its materialistic society . The film really puts into perspective of how we should really experience God 's creations . A combination of Macleans story and my desire to move back to the Northwest has driven me to move to Montana . I want my future kids to be able to rome the landscape , go fly - fishing with me , ride horses into nothing but open land and serene lakes set in the mountainside . A place where you seldom worry about crime . I look around SoCal and all I see is shopping malls , rude snarling people in their Mercedez Bens , miles of vehicles on congested freeways , gangs , racial turmoil on the verge of violent eruption , and everyone skeptical of each others intentions . Anyway the movie is very inspiring with brilliant acting and a deep story about the fragile connections of loved ones . There is a lot of deep thinking in this film . The scenery is worth seeing alone and actually helps relieve tension . You should finish this film relaxed yet full of insights to your own life . It takes a compassionate , intelligent , and spiritual person to really grasp the meaning . If you do n't understand the art of cinema and how a director achieves his goals through dialogue , tone , light , colour , scenery , camera angles / movement , etc . Then this film is probably not for the crowd that thinks " The Fast and the Furious " is the greatest film . Granted it was entertaining but shallow . The bottom line : This film helps to realize that life is not about how much money you have or what things you posses . Rather it is about your relationships with family and friends and the experiences you share together . QUALITY NOT QAUNTITY
neg	Maybe I 'm really getting old , but this one just missed me and the old Funny Bone completely . Surely there must be something powerful wrong with this Irishman ( that 's me , Schultz ! ) . Lordy , lordy what I would give to see the light ! Firstly , that Phil Silvers manic energy , wit and drive was very much a part of the comedic upbringing and overall education in life , if you will . Although it is possible that the series , first titled : " YOU'LL NEVER GET RICH " ( 1955 - 59 * ) could have gotten on the CBS TV Network with someone else in the title role of Sgt . Bilko , it is very hard to picture any other Actor / Comedian in the business wearing those Master Sergeant 's stripes . Such a strong identification is inescapable , though not the same sort of career - wrecking typecasting of a nightmare that it proved to be to some other guys , like Clayton More("THE LONE RANGER " ) , George Reeves ( " THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN " ) and Charles Nelson Riley ( " UNCLE CROC 'S BLOCK " ) . One major stumbling block to successfully adapting and updating such a work from the 1950 's TV Screen to the 1990 's Movie - going public is our collective memory . Without being sure about what percentage of the crowd remembered the Bilko character from seeing the original run and early syndication revivals , and their numbers were surely considerable ; even a large segment of the young had seen Bilko reruns in recent times . It was obvious that the new film and the source were miles ; or even light years apart . So as not to be thought of as a totally square , old grouch please let 's consider some other points . Right here today , the 14th Day of November In The Year of Our Lord 2007 , let me swear and affirm under Oath that I have been a Steve Martin fan for nearly 30 years , Furthermore , I 've enjoyed the wit and talents of Bilko ' 96 Co - Stars Dan Akroyd and the Late Phil Hartman . After all , it was the talents of guys like this and so many others , Alumni of " NBC;s Saturday NIGHT " and " SECOND CITY TV " that kept the last quarter of the 20th Century laughing . But a BILKO re - make ; it just did n't click . Perhaps if the film had been made as a Service Comedy ( always liked ' em ! ) but without the Bilko Show names and gave it some identity of it self it would be more highly regarded by crabby , old guys like me . So , we 've already had so many sitcom and cartoon series turned into movies lately , what 's next ? Howse about somebody doing Hal Roach 's World War II Army Comedy Series of Sergeants DOUBLEDAY & AMES and TV 's 1st Cartoon Series " CRUSADER RABBIT " ? Remember where you heard it first ! POODLE SCHNITZ !
pos	Blade Runner ( Deckard is a Replicant ! ) ,   City of Lost Children ( augmented senses or whatever used and abused and mostly , well , just giving us far less than what we might dream of ) , and Dark City :   These really ought to be added . For a while now , I 've been waiting for an animated film that might affect me as much as Miyazaki 's stuff has . This one is the 1st . Hmm , scratch the " animated " part of that . I have an intense love - hate relationship with film noir and , hey , if you do n't leave , it must be mostly love , right ? But , there are so many sci - fi and noir themes totally submerged in this film that it 's just a wonder to watch . These people did an incredible job !
neg	First , I am not really a fan of the whole " things eating flesh in disgusting new ways " genre of film but I am a bad movie afficionado so my next door neighbor said he had the worst movie ever . This one . So we start watching it . First and foremost - it is recorded on a camcorder sans tripod ! Second the voice of the skinny white doctor is dubbed by a large black man ! Third , none of the dialogue makes any sense . Fourth , the zombie scenes , though unconvincing and chockful of poor makeup and tomato paste , lead me to believe the director ( and my next door neighbor ) are in need of psychological help . It 's funny for about 5 minutes but it gets old fast . It 's so amateurish it 's like watching a poorly dubbed high school video yearbook .... with zombies . A note to anyone involved with this movie - I want the 20 minutes of my life I spent watching this , before I fell asleep , back .
pos	this movie is so complex that it can be given any description and still roll with it . you have a insecure , troubled and fascinating main character ( played by Jean - Pierre Léaud ) who is trapped between two ( no , three ) women . we listen to his social , philosophical and moral idiosyncrasies in interminable monologues , we see him working his magic around the three women that he loves . this could be the premise for a fowl movie , full of rigid , cold , uninteresting commentaries . yet director Jean Eustache manages to keep it fresh , ironic and witty . being such a long movie , one can not but burst into laughing when , after 2 hours of speaking politely , Jean - Pierre Léaud all of a sudden screams on the phone while he remembers a cheesy line from a movie . this kind of situations are purely cinematographic and can not be fully restored in a commentary . nor can someone restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue of Françoise Lebrun towards the end of the movie . 3 and 1/2 hours and worthing every minute .
neg	- The movie opens with a meteor crashing into a lake . Unbeknownst to the locals , a dinosaur egg is also at the bottom of the lake . The meteor heats the lake , turning it into a giant incubator . You guessed it , the egg hatches releasing a dinosaur that proceeds to terrorize the community . - What utter garbage . It 's not that I mind the stop - motion clay dinosaur , it 's everything else about the movie that bothers me . The acting is atrocious . The dialogue is utterly ridiculous . The comic relief is anything but comic . Logic is non - existent . Any similarity between the " scientists " in this movie and an actual scientist is purely coincidental . I could go on for an eternity on the bad aspects of this movie , but you get the idea . I feel it 's fairly safe to call this disaster " MST3 K Worthy " .
pos	I still liked it though . Warren Beatty is only fair as the comic book hero . What saves this movie is the set , the incredible cast and it offshoots a mediocre script . I really expected something more substantial in the terms of action , or plot but I got very little . The main reason to watch this movie is to watch some of the biggest stars in Hollywood at the time in such an unusual film .   The one person who did a terrible job and did not even belong in this film was Madonna . She did not belong in this movie and her acting job was pretty bad . The movie at some points just stood still . You expected something more and you got nothing . Al Pacino plays a really bad dude and he does pretty good . He and Beatty do make an excellent good guy and bad guy .   It is also interesting to see Dustin Hoffman , and Warren Beatty in a film other than Isthar . I did not see Ishtar but I heard bad things . The thing about this movie is it is good , but it could have been so much better . I liked it as a child because I thought it looked cool , and visually the movie is amazing , the sets are incredible , the writing is only fair , and with such a cast in the movie I would expect a little better anyway .   SPOILER I especially thought the finale was not big enough . It was interesting but for such a grand scale film I just thought it could have ended with a little more of a bang . The reason to watch this movie is the atmosphere . The movie only uses the 7 comic book colors making it all that more excellent visually anyway . The costumes and makeup were flawless as well . The facial makeup for the villains was great . Beatty is just not up to such a bigger than life character . Still , this is a good movie that could have been much much more . It is to me better than Batman , the other comic book adaptation that came out close to the same time . Of course that movie was much bigger in terms of gross .
neg	Hollywood does it again . Lots of money , no creativity . I 'm sure the writers were on something other than oxygen when they wrote this one . Based on the previews , I thought that this would be a funny movie . But if you are not up on the latest stupid pop culture then you 'll miss most of the silly humor in this movie . Why waste your time . You can sit on a log doing nothing and have more fun than this movie will provide .

neg	I 've never actually seen this film but can tell you one thing about its production . While a comedy / oldies radio DJ in 1988 , I got a call from the production company . They asked if I 'd write and record a bit they 'd drop into the soundtrack as sounds eminating from a TV ( the television screen itself would never be shown ) . I said sure , wrote a parody of ' 50s sci - fi monster clichés , rounded up some sound effects and called in another DJ , Pam Landry , to play the female part . As she happened to be on the air at the time , she put on a long song , joined me at the mike in the production room and we cut the voicetrack in a single take . Giggling , she then went back to her show while I mixed in the goofy sound effects . We 'd have never done it if we 'd known that " Woodchipper Massacre " was going to be such a turkey -- but , then again , we never got paid for our efforts , either ! -- Gary Theroux
pos	" Welcome to Collingwood " offers some of the most hilarious dialog in recent memory . Watching this comedy directed by the brothers Anthony and Joe Russo reminded us of maybe another film we had seen in the past , but since we missed the opening credits , we had to wait until the end to discover that what we were reminded of , was the 1958 Italian film " Big Deal on Madonna Street " , directed by Mario Monicelli . The Russo brothers put together a magnificent cast to portray all the characters in the film . Anything with William H. Macy , Luis Guzman , Sam Rockwell , Patricia Clarkson , the late Michael Jeter , in it , ca n't be bad . Since this is an ensemble piece all characters get an opportunity in which to shine . The film presents us a group of inane would - be safe crackers from hell . No one could think these men could carry on a job like the one they undertake . Whatever could go wrong , and more , is what they succeed in doing . George Clooney makes a small appearance as the master safe cracker who is also seen impersonating a rabbi , only to be confused with a priest by the gang members coming out of Cossimo 's funeral . The best way to enjoy the movie is to sit back and relax , and let all these small time crooks do their thing . Let their funny lines make you laugh , as anyone can see this gang is doomed from beginning to end !
neg	The film is about a sabretooth on the lose at a amusement park where teens are on a scavenger hunt . Since there are no rules they break into a building and start getting killed off . The deaths are cheesy and are dumb . But at least it had better effects then sabretooth . I gave it a three because Stacy was in it and I loved the movie Sabretooth . I thought it was okay but some deaths were off - screen . There was a dumb scene where the two teens kiss and the sabretooth 's head pops out and the boy leaves his girlfriend behind leaving her to have her totally fake looking red guts out . Then the sabretooth gets up in the vents and bites the kids head off . The end death with the owner was totally fake looking graphics . Even that death was stupid because the statues tooth went through his mouth and hangs there like that will support it and there is a scene when a goth girl loses her contacts does n't find them , and seems like she does n't need the . The film is idiotic and a waste of time .
pos	The first was good and original . I was a not bad horror / comedy movie . So I heard a second one was made and I had to watch it . What really makes this movie work is Judd Nelson 's character and the sometimes clever script . A pretty good script for a person who wrote the Final Destination films and the direction was okay . Sometimes there 's scenes where it looks like it was filmed using a home video camera with a grainy - look . Great made - for - TV movie . It was worth the rental and probably worth buying just to get that nice eerie feeling and watch Judd Nelson 's Stanley doing what he does best . I suggest newcomers to watch the first one before watching the sequel , just so you 'll have an idea what Stanley is like and get a little history background .
neg	but there are not too many of them . Probably the worst " major release " film I have seen in my life . Definitely the worst for this year . There is no point in commenting on the plot , the cast or the acting . The problem is beyond all that . It lays in the absolute stupidity of the annoying kind ( not the funny kind ) of everything that takes place on the screen . I do n't know why I gave it a 2/10 instead of 1/10 . Probably , because of Steven Martini . He really did try . Bottom line - 95 minutes washed down the toilet along with a few brain cells . Avoid at any cost .
pos	The inspiring story of Carl Brashear ( Cuba Gooding , Jr. ) , a black man who grew up in poverty in Kentucky and then joined the US Navy , aspiring to be the first black Master Diver in Navy history . We are shown the series of struggles from boyhood on that Brashear has to overcome to make his dream come true ( and then to keep it alive . ) Not the least of the challenges was Master Diver Bill Sunday ( Robert DeNiro ) , the head trainer at the diving school the Navy sends Brashear to , who is not especially sympathetic to Brashear 's goals , but who ultimately becomes an unlikely friend and supporter . This is a good movie ; fast paced and with a lot of action , although not an " action " pic in the normal sense of the word . There 's a very human story here as well , and an interesting study of racism and the struggle to overcome it ; there 's also a sense of the struggle that took place in the 1960 's between older and younger naval officers ( the " old navy " vs the " new navy . " ) The performances are quite good - particularly Goodings ' . I thought DeNiro was perhaps a bit over the top in his portrayal of Sunday ( although , who knows , Sunday might well have been this extreme kind of loose cannon ) and the portrayal of Sunday 's wife Gwen ( by Charlize Theron ) also made me question whether these parts were " jazzed up " to provide entertainment value . A good movie , though . I never once wondered if it was worth tuning into . 7/10
neg	I rented this movie the other night because neither my girlfriend or myself had ever seen it , even though we had heard from a mutual friend how " great it was " . Now , I am pretty conservative in my views , but I knew going in it would be pretty liberal given who directed it . I figured before the movie started Michael Douglas would play a compassionate popular liberal beloved by the masses , and there would be a stodgy conservative opponent as his antagonist . But I thought that s where the political statement would begin and end . OK , the plot was solid : Single president falls for a lobbyist . OK , this has potential I thought to be pretty entertaining , since the plot was unique . But then the movie turned into a liberal infomercial . The movie became more about gun control and environmental issues than it did about the relationship between the President and Sydney(Annette Bening ) . There were several ridiculous premises in this movie : 1 ) The character Sydney playing this six figure lobbyist who is a " closer " . Could she have been more flighty ? She was constantly disorganized and seemed in awe of everything . Hardly a " closer " . I am an sales , and she could not " close " selling a glass of water to a man dying of thirst . 2 ) Secondly , is there anything more ridiculous than Richard Dreyfuss playing a right wing fanatic ? This is the most liberal man in Hollywood and her is playing some right wing ideologue . Give me a break . I liked how he took his conservative character and made him as sinister as possible . 3 ) The speech at the end was simply ludicrous . The line about " I am a proud card carrying member of the ACLU " was a joke . First , no president would ever admit something like that , being an active member of an ultra fringe group . Second , why even bring something like that up . You just alienated off over half the movie going audience who is moderate or conservative . I thought the plot was great and unique . I thought Michael Douglas was a good choice as president . But the movie went from being a " movie " to a left wing political statement , which is why the movie failed . Its a shame to see a great plot ruined by Hollywood having to force their political views on the audience
pos	I thought the original of this film was quaint and charming as well as having me sitting on the edge of my seat trying to figure it out . Since I had already seen the original , when I saw this on Sci Fi Channel- I do n't know if this remake was deliberately made for Sci Fi - I knew what it was within the first few minutes . Since I like Richard Burgi as a character actor , I wanted to see how he would pull it off . The writers / producers etc , modernized the film a bit by trying to explain the plight of the " aliens " ( They could no longer reproduce their own kind and needed help ) using the same pseudo science that has been crammed in our ears in the 90 's . Maybe it added a bit of polish to the film , or not . This film . Film ? This production takes on a more sinister edge than the original did- The original ended with a confrontation between the young woman and the alien and an understanding of sorts took place , although no resolution of the Alien 's problem . I sort of remember that in this remake , the woman became rather hostile towards the Burgi / Alien- I think it could have ended better . But the ending is just the ending , and the yarn is a swell yarn , being of the basic 1958 Science Fiction Pulp Stock . Many great science fiction stories were written in the 50 's and some of them even made it to film . This is a swell thing to watch on like a rainy day or something . I rate it highly cos of all the remakes of old 50 's Sci Fi , this one came off well . I actually enjoyed this quite a bit . But if anyone really wants to see this story told WELL , I suggest the original 1958 version with Tom Tyron and Gloria Talbott , directed by Gene Fowler Jr.
neg	East Palace , West Palace reminded me somewhat of The Detective , with Frank Sinatra in the role of the cop , and William Windom is the boy . It 's a progressive film for China , I guess , but it also perpetuates myths about the femininity of gay men : much is made of Chinese myths in which men take on female roles . The movie focuses on an effeminate man who wants desperately to be dominated and hurt by a macho guy . He cruises the park without fear -- he hopes to be taken into the stationhouse by the officer . And that in fact happens . Then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to mild torture : made to squat for a period of time , handcuffed , slapped . This is what the gay man wants , and , implicitly , the gay man is challenging the cop 's self - image as a manly man . The story 's about the gay man 's life ( which include flashbacks ) are tolerable , but when he starts describing old Chinese myths and dramatic works , the movie becomes unbearable . It becomes a cry of pity for China 's gays , who only want to fulfill a traditional role in Chinese society . Sorry , I ca n't relate .
pos	Flavia the Heretic is an undeniable work of art and probably my number one recommendation to state that the euro - exploitation cinema is severely underrated and not to be ignored . This is an intelligent and complex film , beautifully realized and  surprise  pretty damn accurate ! This is more than just meaningless sleaze or gratuitous violence and it 's about time those prudish film committees who categorize Flavia as forbidden trash reckon this as well . Flavia is a beautiful 14th century adolescent , forced to live the life of an obedient nun in a strict convent . She refuses to accept her being inferior just because she 's female and she curses her fellow sister for being so tolerant about this . After a fruitless attempt to escape , she befriends another rebellious nun and she even guides a troop of bloodthirsty Muslims into the walls of the convent . Flavia is a downright mesmerizing film ! Almost impossible to believe that director Gianfranco Mingozzi managed to make it appear so realistic and so disturbing . I challenge you to come up with a title that centers on the topic of pioneer - feminism more intensely than Flavia does . Several sequences are quite shocking ( on the verge of nightmarish , actually ) as the camera zooms in on brutal rapes , torture and mutilation . Yet all this raw footage is n't just used to satisfy perverted gorehounds , mind you . I 'm strongly convinced that they 're part of the statement ' Flavia ' is trying to communicate : Humanity ( the Catholic Church in particular ) historically proved itself to be a hypocrite and discriminating race and there 's no use in denying it any further . Films like " Flavia , the Heretic " have the courage to question and openly condemn our precious ancestors and I truly admire them for it . Flavia is an outstanding and fundamental exploitation film because of its substance , but it 's even brought to an higher level by the wondrous cinematography , the glorious costumes & scenery and a breathtaking musical score by Nicola Piovani . Florinda Bolkin is very convincing as the ambitious and headstrong nun but it 's María Casares who steals the show as Sister Agatha . She 's a man - hating and loud - mouthed nun who likes to urinate in the open field ! Amen , sister !
neg	A lot of promise and nothing more . An all - star cast certainly by HK standards , but man oh man is this one a stinker . No story ? That 's okay , the action will make up for it like most HK action flicks . What ? The action is terrible , corny , and sparse ? Dragon Dynasty 's releases up to this point are by and large superb and generally regarded as classics in Asian cinema . This is a blight . They managed to wrangle a couple of actors from Infernal Affairs , but they ca n't bring life to a disjointed script . There are scenes of dialogue where two or three lines are spoken with a cut in between each and no continuity in what the characters are saying . You almost feel like they 're each giving a running monologue and just ignoring the other characters . Michael Biehn is made of wood , really ? Sammo Hung uses a stunt double ? No way . Yes way . Stay away .
pos	The National Gallery of Art showed the long - thought lost original uncut version of this film on July 10 , 2005 . It restores vital scenes cut by censors upon its release . The character of the cobbler , a moral goody - goody individual in the original censored release of 1933 is here presented as a follower of the philosopher Nietsze and urges her to use men to claw her way to the top . Also , the corny ending of the original which I assume is in current VHS versions is eliminated and the ending is restored to its original form . A wonderful film of seduction and power . Hopefully , there will a reissue of this film on DVD for all to appreciate its great qualities . Look for it .
neg	I stumbled upon Nine Dead recently and read the current reviews thinking I could deal with an average movie . This movie however was slightly below average , yet watchable . The script was poorly written and the acting was at average for a B - level movie with a couple standing out as pretty good . The plot borders on that of Saw , teach people what they did wrong in a situation and try to make them appreciate life more , but that is really where the comparison ends . Nine dead tries to have heart and purpose behind simple ideas that are not new . The main fault that I found in Nine dead , was the slap in the face to the viewer of flashbacks that occurred 3 minutes before in the film and were completely unnecessary and a completely inadequate ending that people wo n't see coming , in a bad way . Barring any spoilers I have seen the worse of bad movies and even they did n't end this poorly . Decent flick , bad acting and ending though ...
pos	Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their roles with such believability , I simply cried . Glenn Close 's role as Ruth , showed her wanting to deal with the situation , but she was under the domination of her husband . " Let him think about what he did , " Robert Duvall 's character , Joe , said staunchly . The story depicted a rural family dealing with an accidental death of a son by his brother , called " The Stone Boy , " meaning he was so distraught and overwhelmed by what he did , he became emotionally paralyzed . Then towards the end when Jason Presson 's character , Arnold , let it all out to a stranger , I was so broken hearted for him , that I actually thought of some of the terrible things that I did in my life . I personalized and identified with his character . Frederick Forrest 's and Gail Youngs ' roles , did NOT add not much to the film . I thought of Frederick Forrest , who played Ruth 's antagonistic , womanizing brother , Andy , as a jerk who did nothing to try to help the situation . His wife , Lou , played by Gail Youngs , acted like a crazy - lady smacking Arnold around out of frustration with her own problems without pity and blaming him for her troubles . I could NOT really feel sorry for these two . Though Lou tried to keep her marriage together , she was unsuccessful . Both did NOT deal with their problems effectively . They really did NOTHING for the film and were totally ridiculous . Wilfred Brimley 's minor role as the grandfather was , touching for he was the only character that showed Arnold any attention . I felt his role should have been elaborated . The players were just doing what they felt was adequate and sufficient . However , I really liked the ending so much , I actually smiled and cried tears of joy . I felt good . The Hillermans were a family again . I actually wanted to be a part of this family . They were so realistic .
neg	The film starts with a manager ( Nicholas Bell ) giving welcome investors ( Robert Carradine ) to Primal Park . A secret project mutating a primal animal using fossilized DNA , like ¨Jurassik Park¨ , and some scientists resurrect one of nature 's most fearsome predators , the Sabretooth tiger or Smilodon . Scientific ambition turns deadly , however , and when the high voltage fence is opened the creature escape and begins savagely stalking its prey - the human visitors , tourists and scientific . Meanwhile some youngsters enter in the restricted area of the security center and are attacked by a pack of large pre - historical animals which are deadlier and bigger . In addition , a security agent ( Stacy Haiduk ) and her mate ( Brian Wimmer ) fight hardly against the carnivorous Smilodons . The Sabretooths , themselves , of course , are the real star stars and they are astounding terrifyingly though not convincing . The giant animals savagely are stalking its prey and the group run afoul and fight against one nature 's most fearsome predators . Furthermore a third Sabretooth more dangerous and slow stalks its victims . The movie delivers the goods with lots of blood and gore as beheading , hair - raising chills , full of scares when the Sabretooths appear with mediocre special effects . The story provides exciting and stirring entertainment but it results to be quite boring .The giant animals are majority made by computer generator and seem totally lousy .Middling performances though the players reacting appropriately to becoming food . Actors give vigorously physical performances dodging the beasts , running , bound and leaps or dangling over walls . And it packs a ridiculous final deadly scene . No for small kids by realistic , gory and violent attack scenes . Other films about Sabretooths or Smilodon are the following : ¨Sabretooth(2002)¨by James R Hickox with Vanessa Angel , David Keith and John Rhys Davies and the much better ¨10.000 BC(2006)¨ by Roland Emmerich with with Steven Strait , Cliff Curtis and Camilla Belle . This motion picture filled with bloody moments is badly directed by George Miller and with no originality because takes too many elements from previous films . Miller is an Australian director usually working for television ( Tidal wave , Journey to the center of the earth , and many others ) and occasionally for cinema ( The man from Snowy river , Zeus and Roxanne , Robinson Crusoe ) . Rating : Below average , bottom of barrel .
pos	Although I was born in the year that this movie came out and had never heard of it until my junior year of high school ( 1996 ) when I saw it I became totally engrossed laughing and crying and feeling along with the characters because me and my friends were them . Their hair , clothes and speech were outdated but the emotions and the desperation of each situation were so familiar ! I remember thinking how real it was and how I wished that they would make movies like that still . In fact I saw this movie the night after I had been at a crazy party ( not so unlike the one in Jay 's house ) which had been crashed by what we considered the loser derelicts who hung out on the fringes of our crowd . A world class BS'er and " responsible " mother figure type I identified immediately with Jeanie ( I was also the one with a car ) although I had a little bit of Madge 's insecurities floating around in there too . My best friend was a Deidre and her good friend from childhood was our Annie . Watching the scene when Jeanie is in school or the one where her and her boyfriend break up and then she is telling Madge how much she loved him felt like conversations and situations I had personally had . Now at the age of 27 I recently saw the movie again and felt a surge of emotions because it was like watching back a piece of my own youth ( though none of my friends died ) . I think this is a must see for all girls 13 and up .
neg	Although Bette Davis did a WONDERFUL job as Mildred , I felt that the film was n't the best I had seen . At the end of the movie I was left feeling like there was something missing in it . Bette Davis did a perfect job , though , and she made me hate her and pity her all the while . Leslie Howard did very good as the lovelorn Philip Carey , and I so pitied him throughout the movie for being in love with such a horrible dame . It 's such a sad thing when one finds him / herself in love with a bad seed . And especially if it 's someone like Philp Carey , who is a sensitive person , though pathetic . In the end , the acting was what came through and not the plot . The ending scene was particularly good , but I am not one to give it away . Although others may find this movie good , I was one who found it so - so . I should recommend this movie to those who like a bad seed so they can see what may happen to them if they find themselves in love with that horrible person .
pos	I read some previous comments stating that this movie loses steam towards the end of the movie and also that it has a similar ending to Cape Fear . I completely disagree . I 'm going to give a simple review for the normal moviegoers out there . I thought the casting was perfect . I thought this was one of Ed Harris 's best performances . What an evil psychopath ! ! ! I have a lot of respect for his acting after viewing his performance in this movie . I was riveted throughout this movie . If you like mystery thrillers then this definitely a movie you want to see . I also noticed a young Scarlett Johannson in this movie . This movie is filled with top stars and I highly recommend it !
neg	Nominated for the oscar " worst script ever " in my opinion . There 's no decent story , rediculous acting , VERY lousy humor . By every means possible , if you have little self respect please do n't waste your time seeing this movie . Although u can see the actors CAN act , it leaves you dumber after watching it . Precious braincells are being killed watching this crap ... i warned u DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE
pos	Usually I do n't really like Emma Roberts so much , but after watching Nancy Drew it kind of changed my mind . The actors in the movies made the whole thing exciting and funny . Most of the time when you watch a mystery movie you can solve it before the middle of the show , but in this movie it 's like you are actually there . The clues have to all fit together until you can finally understand the whole crime . I am still amazed how she found it out . The whole movie was really clever and the people who watched it with me loved the movie too . The clothes were my favorite part of the movie , it was so cute . I do n't think there will be another movie like this until the sequel comes out . I give it a nine because the popular girls did n't really seem to have the part just right , but they still make me laugh . It was a really great movie and a great mystery . I definitely recommend watching it .
neg	OK maybe a 13 year old like me was a little to old for this movie . Its about this pampered rat , who lives in a palace . Then a sewer rat flushes him down a toilet ! He ends up in this rat city and meets this girl rat who has a gem a greedy frog wants . He will do anything for this gem he sends a whole army after these two rats . He plans to take the gem and to flood rat city ! THe cool part about this movie is the slugs . They do all the sound effects . They sing , make noises , its awesome , its also pretty funny . OK bottom line , it is aimed at 7 year olds . Other wise , a great movie to take a younger family member to see . I did n't think the animation was real dreamworks art though , more like WAllace and Gromit . i thinkthey slacked a little on that . The movie was just decent , not worth spending $ 9.50 for though , sorry .
pos	Brutal , emotionless Michael Myers stabs his sister to death at age six on Halloween night in 1963 ; on October 30 , 1978 , he escapes from a mental institution and institutes a new reign of terror in his hometown of Haddonfield , Illinois . He is pursued the whole time by a psychiatrist ( Donald Pleasence ) who knows just how evil this young man is . It opens with a bang , and sets up a genuinely suspenseful and atmospheric chiller that is actually superior to the many slasher pictures it helped to inspire . It 's subtle compared to the nasty bloodbaths many of those subsequent movies were ; subtle , and scary . It retains the ability to make me jump even after repeated viewings . How many movies are there , really , that can continue to be frightening even after one has seen them before ? Not very many . Pleasence is great in what was probably the definitive role of his career ; Jamie Lee Curtis , in her motion picture debut , became a bona fide scream queen after acting in " Halloween " as well as a few subsequent slasher pictures , and she is an intended victim worth rooting for . Co - writer / director John Carpenter knows what works in this movie , making excellent use of shadows and dark skies ; notice how most of the movie is set after nightfall . With this picture , he and his former collaborator Debra Hill created a franchise that has spawned seven sequels , many imitators , and an upcoming " re - imagining " . It 's very quotable - who could ever forget Dr. Loomis ' ( Pleasence ) speech in which he describes Michael Myers to the sheriff ( Charles Cyphers , a reliable repertory player in several of Carpenter 's earlier works ) ? It 's fantastic , and worth seeking out . This is my favorite John Carpenter movie of all time . It 's not totally infallible - there are script holes , after all - but overall it makes a solid impact . 9/10
neg	I 'm grateful for one thing and one thing only - that this woman will now be thousands of miles away on an entirely different continent ! ! ! Yay ! ! ! This programme summed up perfectly just how obsessed Victoria Beckham has become with whoring herself and her family out to the media in the name of self promotion and ' Brand f*cking Beckham ' . A few years ago I used to really like ' Posh and Becks ' , I still very much admire David 's talent , but I have no respect for him anymore . How can you respect someone who has his wife 's hand shoved up his backside working him like a puppet . It was clear the hand of Victoria was all over Beckham 's premature departure from Manchester United and now the same thing has happened at Real Madrid . I hope Beckham can live with the fact that although he may be earning squillions of pounds - he 's sold his soul for the American Buck and will end his days playing for a team who would struggle to gain promotion from Division One in England ( no offence America - but at Baseball and Basketball you rule - football you do n't ! )   Anyway - I digress . It 's been years since I 've seen such an over - the - top , entirely false performance from ' Posh ' - this being topped only during her cringe worthy red carpet performances following the Rebecca Loos ' debacle ' , when instead of throwing all the cr*p at David he deserved , she desperately clung onto his arm trying to save the million pound money - spinner her marriage has become . This whole PR stunt was pathetic . Why ca n't she just go over there quietly , support her husband through the biggest mistake of his professional career and keep her head down ? When did she become so full of self importance that she feels the move to America should be shrouded by this huge fan fare ?   Incidentally , I saw the David Beckham documentary last night . At least he has retained a sliver of grace and humility . Two things his wife could do with learning . One more thing Victoria - you complain about constantly being hounded by the paps . Little hint - stop tipping them off about your whereabouts you stupid woman . Good Luck America ! !
pos	In complete contrast to the opinions of the other review , this film actually was surprisingly good ! I reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clichés , obvious jokes and overacting , all of which the trailer had promised . However , after 5 minutes in I found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting . With only one ' toilet humour ' gag , Over Her Dead Body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and , without spoiling anything too much , some of the moments involving animals are hilarious . The staple ingredients of a good film are all there ; script , director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy , this film stands tall . Sure , you are n't going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening , but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time !
neg	I have done quite a few reviews on IMDb and this film is unique in that I never saw the entire movie . It was so terribly stupid and unfunny that I just could n't sit through it -- though I tried . The biggest problem with this and any Mel Brooks movie I call " the Mel quotient " . In other words , the better his movie , the less of him you see in the film . Think about it -- The Producers and Young Frankenstein were great films and he was barely in them at all . BUT , films like Life Stinks and Space Balls are chock full of Mel and are pretty dopey movies ( yes , I DID NOT LIKE Space Balls -- but this is n't the place to talk about that ) . Second , apart from cancer , rectal itch and mental retardation , I ca n't think of a less funny topic than homelessness . This is just a comedy breaker . Think about it , folks . The FUNNIEST ( ? ) scene in the movie has Mel making whoopee with Leslie Ann Warren in a dumpster ! ! And this is funny in what way ?
pos	The key to the joy and beauty , the pain and sadness of life is our ability to accept that life basically is what it is so we do n't constantly struggle against that single compelling truth . In so doing , we find peace . Elegant in its simplicity but so hard for most of us to grasp . In this film , the director shows us this truth but allows us to discover it in our own way . This is a beautiful yet simple story , more of a fable , which is played very well . Watching the actors is more like being in a room with real people than it is just watching actors . I struggled with how to write a review of this fine film so others would be motivated to see it . I 'm at a loss . The story is about men in a bath house . Sounds like a real turn off , right ? But , nothing could be farther from the truth . The American title for this film is The Shower but that is almost an antithesis to a major thematic element in this film , which is the bath . I 'm still at a loss . Talking about the story or the characters will not do them justice . So , I 'll just tell you how much I enjoyed watching this movie and how touching and moving the experience was . I was also quite entertained . I cared deeply for the characters and I cared deeply about what happened to them . For any story , that is the highest form of praise . If you were moved by movies like The King Of Masks or Not One Less , then make sure you see The Shower . Netflix has it and the DVD video and sound quality are excellent . I watched it in the original lanquage with well done and well placed English subs .
neg	Really . Does any week go by that Oprah does n't remind us that she was abused as child ? She makes herself the focus of every interview . Oprah can not resist commenting on the answer to every question she asks . She often interrupts guests before an answer is finished to interject her own aside or anecdote . Directors are obviously instructed to focus on her closeup reaction rather than guest 's faces because that 's what counts - what Oprah feels , what Oprah says . Oprah , Oprah , Oprah . It 's always all about Oprah . Oprah says - Feel sorry for me , I was so poor . Feel the pain of my battle with my weight . Feel my hurt when I 'm turned away from a fancy store after they 've already closed . Feel good for buying my magazines and books . Feel good for my success . Feel good when you give to my charity to make me look good . Feel good for making me rich beyond belief . My interpretation of her point of view : YOU VIEWERS ARE ALL DEEPLY FLAWED AND YOU NEED MY DAILY ADVICE . I have all the answers for your life though I have nothing in common with you plebes . I have never been married nor do I want to be . I have never had to raise a family - but I know all about it . I have little respect for men or marriage . I clearly prefer people like me over others - witness " Legends Ball 2006 " . Gayle is my best friend but we are not gay . As of 7/31/2006 , the heading on her website actually reads : " Oprah.com is your leading source for information about love , life , self , relationships , food , home , spirit and health . " How presumptive and obnoxious is that ?   In June 2006 , she crashed two private wedding receptions in Oklahoma to gather footage for her September 2006 shows . She keeps promising to quit TV but her yapfest drags on with no end in sight . Contrary to what she thinks , Oprah is neither a queen nor a goddess nor on a personal mission from God . She 's just one very lucky , overweight , black woman who copied Phil Donahue 's style and called it her own . She happened to be in the right place at the right time and knew exactly how to suck up to the right demographic .   Oprah is the P.T.

pos	Romance is in the air and love is in bloom in Victorian era England , in this light - hearted story set against a society in a time in which manners were still in vogue , the ladies were charming and elegant , and the gentlemen dashing . ` Emma , ' based on the novel by Jane Austen and written for the screen and directed by Douglas McGrath , stars the lovely Gwyneth Paltrow in the title role . A self - appointed matchmaker , Emma takes great delight in the romantic notion of playing Cupid and attempting to pair up those she feels are suited to one another . Coming off a successful matching that ended in marriage , she next sets her sights on finding a mate for her friend , Harriet ( Toni Collette ) , but the outcome of her initial attempt proves to be less than satisfying . Meanwhile , her endeavors are tempered by by the handsome Mr. Knightley ( Jeremy Northam ) , whose insights into matters of the heart often seem to be a bit more astute than Emma 's , and lend some needed balance to the proceedings . And Emma , so concerned with what is right for others , neglects the heart that is actually the most important of all : Her own . The world goes round and love abounds , but Emma is about to miss the boat . Luckily for her , however , the is someone just right for her waiting in the wings . Now , if she can but stop long enough to realize it . But as everyone who has known true love knows , matters of the heart can go right or wrong in an instant , depending upon the slightest thing ; and while romance is at hand for Emma , she must first recognize it , and seize the moment .
neg	My title above says it all . Let me make it clearer . If you have seen the BBC 's " Planet Earth " , which I am sure most of you have , then you are not gon na like this movie too much . And I own all the discs of " Planet Earth " I had seen the rating for this movie very high , and read good reviews about it . I was excited to check it out . Alas , I went to the theater and the movie started , I saw it was a Disney movie with production companies listing BBC and Discovery . And when they started the first scenes about the polar bear , I recognized them from my DVDs at home of " Planet Earth " . The movie continued and went on and on and on , me and my friends kept on recognizing the scenes were all from " Planet Earth " . We were very very disappointed , as I think 90 % of the footage is from " Planet Earth " . I am saying 90 % , because some of the scenes I did n't recognize . I have a feeling that I simply did n't remember them . So finally what this movie really is , is a compilation of different footages from the different discs of " Planet Earth " , with a narration aimed at kids . Yes , the narration is quite kiddish . Let me give you an example . When they show the polar cubs walking away from the mother cub , the narrator says " The polar cubs are not like human kids . They do n't always listen to their mothers " ( I do n't remember the exact words , but this is how it is ) So in a nutshell . This is condensed " Planet Earth " for kids !
pos	Samuel Fuller is hardly one of America 's great directors . I 'm not sure he qualifies as one of Hollywood 's great craftsmen . But he certainly ranks up there with the best of Hollywood 's true professionals who were willing to march to their own music . During the time he worked for Hollywood studios , he knew how to take an assignment , shape the middling material handed to him and then turn it quickly and efficiently into something usually better than its parts ... on time and on budget . Pickup on South Street is a case in point . On the surface it 's one more of Hollywood 's early Fifties ' anti - Commie movies , complete with appeals to patriotism , a hard - boiled hero and a slimy ( and copiously perspiring ) bad guy . Fuller turns this bag of Hollywood clichés into a taut , exciting drama with any number of off - kilter twists . The hero , Skip McCoy , is a three - time loser , a petty crook with soft fingers who does n't change his stripes until the very end . The girl in the caper , Candy , has a level of virtue that would be easy to step over if you 're so inclined . One of the most appealing characters , Moe Williams , is a stoolie . And in an unusual approach to Hollywood 's battle against Commies , the appeals to patriotism fall on deaf ears ; the hero is n't motivated by anything so ennobling . He just wants payback for a personal reason , and winds up becoming ... at least for now ... a good guy .   Plus , all the actors were mostly assigned to Fuller by the studio . He had to make do . Richard Widmark by now had established his presence as an actor and star , but Jean Peters is a surprise . She gives a fine portrait of a woman sexy and dumb , and no better than her boy friends ... or her clients ... want her to be . And Richard Kiley , who later would become a two- time Tony award winning star on Broadway , is convincingly slippery and cowardly . It 's hard to remember that he was the actor who inflicted on us , I mean introduced to us , " The Impossible Dream " from Man of La Mancha ,   More than anything else , this tale of a pickpocket who picks a purse in a subway car and finds himself with microfilmed secrets instead of cash , pursued by the Feds and the Commies , moves straight ahead with great economy . The whole enterprise , with a classic noir look , only takes 80 minutes to tell . The dialogue , with Fuller as screenwriter , has that party corny , partly pungent hard - boiled pulp fiction style . " That muffin you grifted ... she 's okay , " one character says to Skip about Candy . Fuller moves us just fast enough from scene to scene to keep us hanging on what will come next . Then Fuller throws in the character of Moe Williams . All of a sudden the story ratchets up to a whole new level of interest , part comedy relief and part sad inevitability .   The thing I like best about the movie is how the opening exemplifies Fuller 's talents and strengths . In 2 minutes and 15 seconds , starting right after the credits , Fuller is able to instantly power up the movie , to establish for us what the story is about , and to show us what kind of characters -- Skip and Candy -- we 're going to be involved with . And he does this with so much enticing curiosity in that hot , packed subway car that we can just about feel Fuller setting the hook to catch us .   Says Glenn Erickson , in my opinion one of the best of movie critics , " In what should be an inconsequential story , Sam Fuller defines his peculiar view of Americanism from the bottom up : stiff - necked , aggressive self - interest that when fully expressed recognizes what 's wrong and what 's right and is n't afraid to fight for it . As always in his work , the individuals who fight the hardest for their country are the ones least likely to benefit from the effort . " He 's right , and it makes for a movie still vivid after 55 years .
neg	I loved this movie , I 'll admit it . This has to be the best ( straight to ? ) video movie I 've seen . Well ... me and my friend decided just for shits n ' giggles that we 'd rent this movie . We knew what to expect and we got exactly what we expected , plus more . When that red neck gets slammed up against the tree by the Sasquatch , we literally watched that part about three to four times , it was that amazing ( hysterically , of course ) . And why ? Oh why does the main character have to roll that much ? Like honestly , we know that you 're in danger , rolling that much is n't gon na help all that much . But really , if this movie is in you 're local video store RENT IT . It is worth the money and it 's not even that bad , like it 's bad , but not incredibly bad . Overall , complete amazing will be in store for you if you rent this movie .
pos	Undoubtedly the best heavy metal horror item made in the manically headbangin ' 80 's , which admittedly does n't sound like much considering how utterly abysmal many other entries in this odd little fright film sub - genre like " Hard Rock Zombies , " " Blood Tracks , " " Terror on Tour , " and the especially ungodly Jon - Mikl Thor - starring stinker " Rock'n'Roll Nightmare " tended to be . That aside , this one still deserves props for downplaying the excessive splatter and needlessly flashy special f / x razzle - dazzle in favor of focusing on adolescent high school characters who are depicted with greater acuity and plausibility than the norm for a mid-80 's teen - targeted scarefest . Moreover , the film 's pointed sardonic parodying of both ridiculously overblown 80 's heavy metal stupidity and the nauseating self - righteousness of the uptight killjoy conservative stiffs who claimed it was the devil 's music are very clever and on the money funny ( famed Greed Decade heavy metal god Ozzy Osbourne has a hilarious bit as a smarmy anti - metal TV evangelist ! ) . Marc Price ( the hopelessly dweeby Skippy on " Family Ties " ) gives a surprisingly strong and winning performance as Eddie " Ragman " Weinbauer , a geeky , socially awkward and severely persecuted heavy metal aficionado who 's constantly picked on by the stuck - up jerk preppie bullies who make up the majority of the student body at Lakeridge High School ( the cruelty and mean - spiritedness of the high school kids is nailed with painfully credible accuracy ) . Eddie 's life takes a turn for the worse when his rock star idol Sammi Curr ( an impressively whacked - out portrayal by Tony Fields ) perishes in a hotel fire . Hip local disc jockey Nuke ( KISS front - man Gene Simmons in a cool cameo ) hooks Eddie up with Sammi 's final , unreleased album , which when played backwards resurrects Curr 's malevolent spirit back from the dead . Sammi encourages Eddie to sic him on all the vile scumbags who make poor Eddie 's life the proverbial living hell , only to have meek Eddie prove to be a most reluctant would - be accomplice . It 's up to Eddie , assisted by token nice girl Leslie Graham ( likeably essayed by the lovely Lisa Orgolini ) , to stop Sammi before things get too out of hand . Ably directed with commendable thoughtfulness and sensitivity by character actor Charles Martin Smith ( who also briefly appears as a nerdy school teacher ) , smartly written by Michael S. Murphy , Joel Soisson , and Rhet Topham , and capably acted by a uniformly up - to - snuff cast , this surefire sleeper even comes complete with a handful of nifty " jump " moments ( an outrageous attack in the back of a car by a grotesquely lecherous long - tongued mutant thingie rates as the definite highlight ) , a rousing " Carrie "- style high school dance slaughter sequence , a neatly utilized Halloween setting , revenge being correctly shown as a truly ugly business , and a solid central message that you should n't make a particular over - hyped person your hero strictly because of the calculated anti - establishment posturing said fellow does to qualify for that special status .
neg	1 is being pretty generous here . I really enjoyed BOOGEYMAN , even though it is not really the BOOGEYMAN promoted on the DVD cover and we all know it ! It creeped me out . But this film , it is something else . For being directed by a guy who has been around a long time and directed a lot of movies , it looks like it was shot on a VHS camcorder by a 10 year old ! The story and acting are atrocious ! David Hess , you have let me down too . After playing one of the most menacing villains in film history , you have resorted to this ? The story and acting may have been able to be forgiven however , if anyone had taken the time to make the video look somewhat professional . There are a LOT of shot on video films out there that do n't look like it , or at least are n't so obvious that it detracts your attention from the film . I ca n't say it is the worst movie ever , because I could n't make it through the entire film , but it is certainly close .
pos	Somewhat too long and going over the top towards the end , this comedy is an utterly delightful , never condescending or ridiculing look into the problems of a " power man " , who likes to wear women´s clothes at nite . Julie Walters is lovely as always , but Adrian Pasdar is utterly credible and steals the film . He ( she)is absolutely gorgeous in high heels and silk stockings .
neg	If the makers of Atlantis had something to say in this film , its theme was ( literally ) drowned out by the emphasis on " special effects " over characterization . Almost as if in an attempt to " keep up " with the rest of the summer action blockbusters , Disney has ditched the character - driven , movie - with - a - message approach in favor of a Star Wars " shoot-'em - up " with stereotype heroes and villains . The art is cartoony and the producers think that they can rely on computer generated images ( CGI ) of flying fish - craft and submarines to fill the gap . They are wrong , and the days of beautiful , handcrafted animation is fast flying out the window in favor of assembly - line CGI . This movie is all spectacle with no heart . At times the film comes close to being a good , worthwhile movie , but frustratingly misses the mark so many times by copping out of talking about something meaningful and instead choosing to go with the glitz . Another problem with the movie is the pacing . It starts confusingly and then begins to rocket along with a choppy story editing style that is not appreciated . The viewer is rushed out of the door along with Milo Thatch ( voiced well by Michael J. Fox ) and is left thinking " Gee there must be an awful lot of stuff that 's going to happen once we get to Atlantis " . Unfortunately , not much happens . The secret of Atlantis remains a secret with the story - tellers not really knowing how to explain the legendary island / continent . They are afraid to commit to saying where Atlantis is , even in a fictional story . Is it in the Atlantic ? Is it in the Mediterranean Sea ? Who knows ? Nothing is hypothesized , even from a purely fantasy - based point of view . The viewer will leave the theatre asking themselves " Now what was that all about ? What was the point of the movie ? Why could n't the surviving Atlantean 's remember how to read when many of them lived through the disaster to the " present " day ? And WHY did Atlantis sink ? " and then promptly begin to forget about what they saw . There is nothing left to think about or mill over ... except the loss of money in their wallets . The characters and their motivations are equally unfathomable . From the eccentric zillionaire who founds the expedition with seemingly more money that existed on the entire planet in 1914 , to the ( spoiler ) collective consciousness that enters Kida and VOLUNTARILY deserts its people ! ? ! The crew are a collection of quirky , 2-dimensional people of anachronistically ( for 1914 ) P.C. race and gender . The demolitions expert talks like he came right out of a Warner Brothers ' Bugs Bunny short . Most of the jokes are gross one - liners that are largely missed by the audience for two reasons : They are delivered at lightning - speed pacing and usually mumbled . The way these supporting players do a moral turn - around near the end of the movie is hard to believe . While we applaud Disney for trying to create animated movies for adults - and this is the first Disney not to have cute , talking animals or objects - it fails to make the transition . Younger children will be frightened by some of the action scenes and be left in the dark by the large amount of subtitles ( when the characters speak Atlantean ) . In the first five minutes of the expedition , approximately 200 people are killed without a second thought . Obviously Disney thinks that if you did n't know who those people were , then why should you care ? Again , the movie has no feelings on any level . Mulan and Tarzan were the last animated movies produced by Disney that were done extremely well . Sadly , Atlantis harkens back to those failed attempts in the past such as the Black Cauldron and Hunchback of Notre Dame . Disney needs to get back to their roots . A sequel to Peter Pan is coming out shortly but one never knows what the results will be until you see it for yourself . And now that Disney has discovered Science Fiction one hopes that they will realize that that genre must have more than spectacle to it . We also hope that the upcoming " Treasure Planet " , a sci - fi adaptation of Robert L. Stevenson 's " Treasure Island " , will have more heart to it than the unfathomable " Atlantis : The Lost Empire " .
pos	Personally , I find the movie to be quite a good watch . It outlines the actual situation of triads in Hong Kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triads are organized . Not only that , it also shows the viewer how the Hong Kong police control the triad situation and why the police do n't just go all out and wipe out triads . Overall , the movie is rather violent due to the gangland methods of killings & torture . Nevertheless , the movie stays true to the real world , thus the violence on screen is just a reflection of what really happens . I 'd recommend this movie to any Triad / Mafia movie fan . Another good watch would be Dragon Squad . That movie has more guns than this , as in this movie there 's more knives than guns ( in fact I do n't remember seeing a single gun ) .
neg	yeah cheap shot i know , but this movie is a great example of how a collection of signifiers of ' deepness ' ( political turmoil , love / lust ) can be combined haphazardly to great critical acclaim ( see also ' american beauty ' ) . kaufman 's movie plods along with gratuitous sex scenes interspersed with often painful dialog sequences ( in one scene i counted three different ' generic European ' accents affected by the actors ) and displays of state might run amok , yet fails to tie them together into the coherent meditation kundera offered . and in its over - long three hours it manages almost completely to gloss over franz , the missing fourth piece in the love triangle that lies at the heart of the plot , and in this manner sacrifices the novel 's central mechanism of displaying the spectrum of emotions and of power relations that obtain in love affairs . it also fails to even include token screen time for tomas ' son , used in the novel to exemplify some of the political points kundera was making in the novel . combined with the overweening soundtrack , these flaws make this movie 's three hours unbearably weighty in tone yet light in content .
pos	This movie has taken a lot of stick . It was slated by critics when it came out and was blamed for wrecking Nicolas Cage 's career . The thing I do n't think people get is that it 's not meant to be an epic , Oscar contender of a movie , it 's just some brilliant " Bruck - buster " action at its best . Fast cars , quick editing and a great soundtrack - it does exactly what it says on the tin . Also , for anyone who likes cars its a pure treat . It has everything : Ferraris , Mercs , a Hummer and lets not forget Eleanor ! I think you 'd be hard pushed to find a better action movie , and personally , a better movie at all ! ! Then again maybe that 's just me !
neg	.... may seem far fetched .... but there really was a real life story .. of a man who had an affair with a woman , who found out where he and his new wife were staying , , and she killed the wife , , making it look like a murder rape ....... in her delusion she had told everyone that the man had asked her to marry him .. so she quit her job in Wisconsin ... and moved to Minnesota .......... last I heard she was in a mental institution , Security Prison .... she was still wearing the " engagement ring . " that she has purchased for herself ... and had told everyone that he had bought it for her . The events took place in a small town in Wisconsin , , , , , , , and the murder happened in Minnesota ...... There even was a feature story in " People " magazine ... Spring of 1988 , I want to say on Page 39 . I remember this as I was in college at the time , , and a colleague of mine had met the individual in the Security Hospital ....
pos	i would have to say that this is the first quality romantic - comedy i have ever seen . it had depth and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together there was still longing and anticipation . the thought that maybe they wo n't get together ... it is an indie film after all . this movie was well written , directed and acted . the dancing on the side of the road scene was magnificent .
neg	Let 's face it-- if you rented a STDVD sequel of a forgotten 80 's gem , and expected it to be better than the aforementioned , then you are an idiot . Wargames : The Dead Code joins the long running list of unnecessary sequels that the DVD market has filled so easily . Movies like this do n't need spoilers , because YOU already know them . The " plot " for this " film " , is as follows : Nerd meets girl ; girl likes nerd ; nerd likes girl ; nerd gets accidentally involved with Top Secret Government computer ; nerd and girl go to another country ; nerd and girl end up being persecuted by Government suits in the other country ; nerd and girl meet some important old guy that dies at key point in the " film " ; nerd and girl are captured ; the Top Secret Government computer gets crazy ; nerd is hired to beat Top Secret Government Computer ; nerd beats Top Secret Computer by using the same old Top Secret Computer from the first Wargames " film " ; nerd saves the day ; nerd gets laid .   The end . The acting , script , effects , score , and cinematography are what you would expect-- B - grade . Some familiar faces are in here , and unless you are a mega fan of Colm Feore , then you should avoid this one . Granted , the movie wo n't make you insane enough to eat your own toes by seeing it , so if you like cheap looking STDVD sequels , then you are right at home . Sadly , Mathew Broderick was too involved with some " masterpiece " , that he could n't even do a five second cameo in this one . But can you blame him ?
pos	A lot of people do n't think Branagh 's Hamlet film is all that good , but I must admit I think it is splendid . Like virtually every production of Shakespeare , it has problems and it has had to make hard choices , not all of which work out . The thing about the " secret doors everywhere " , for instance , simply does n't work . That element never achieves the ominous feeling of metaphor or analogy that it attempts to , which results in the play being too gaudy and losing its trademark sense of a thousand mysteries looming . This is the biggest problem with this production . And while it 's a biggie , I 'm also inclined to say that it 's the only problem . Almost everything else works out absolutely beautifully . All right , so Branagh is a mite too old for the title role . And the relationship with Ophelia seems a little forced . And he gets too hysterical at times . But that 's it . No other complaints . Even with these faults , I think this version is a seminal one , and if it 's not as powerful a drama as it ought to be , it 's every bit the literary work that it equally ought to be . We get the complete text of the longest version of the play , innovatively and expensively brought to the screen , mostly enunciated in perfect and modern and highly understandable voices - even if they sometimes speak too quickly in order to get the massive text over with . But in a staging of Shakespeare , it simply is not possible to speak slowly enough for the audience to really appreciate the full depths of the language . For that , one must delve into the print versions of the plays . All the actors of this version are simply mesmerizing and utterly and instantly classic ( incl . Jack Lemmon ) . Julie Christie as Gertrude is surely one of the best ever , and even the American actors are astounding , esp . Charlton Heston as the Player King - who would have thought it ? ! ( A story is going around that Heston once played Hamlet on stage , and when a critic in the front row could n't stand his hammy acting and said out loud , " This is terrible ! " , Heston reportedly retorted right from the stage : " Well , I did n't write this crap ! " Of course it may not be true , but it 's a funny story - and if true , a bold and ironic choice for Branagh to include Heston here . ) Robin Williams as " Young Ozric " is perhaps not young enough for the part , but he makes it a comical one , which is warranted . Overall it is a very well - produced version , with most of the key scenes being , to my mind , supremely memorable . Of course , I watched this movie just as I was becoming interested in Shakespeare ( and around the same time as Luhrmann 's formidable Romeo+Juliet ) , and it made a great impression on me , which must account for some of my fondness for it . All things considered , I must pronounce Branagh 's Hamlet to be my favorite one , with Derek Jacobi 's 1980 BBC version a close second . I probably like Branagh 's Shakespeare work more than most , finding him an expert interpreter and popularizer , with an attractively casual attitude to the words and a deep and appropriately and unashamedly enthusiastic appreciation of the text . In the world of Shakespeare acting , the two brightest luminaries remain Olivier and Branagh , and while Olivier is the superior actor , Branagh brings Shakespeare down from the pedestal of snobbery and artifice , and transforms it into churlish , easy - going , populistic worldliness while compromising none of its dignity . Branagh , I believe , brings out a truer Shakespeare than the world has yet seen . And so , 10 out of 10 for an absolutely tremendous Hamlet .
neg	Well where do I begin my story ? ? I went to this movie tonight with a few friends not knowing more than the Actors that were in it , and that it was supposed to be a horror movie . Well I figured out within the first 20 minutes , what a poor decision I had made going out seeing this movie . The Plot was crap , and so was the script . The lines were horrible to the point that people in the audience were laughing hysterically . The cast could n't have been more plastic looking . Even some of the scenes seemed like they should have been made much quicker ... like they dragged on for no particular reason . Very poor editing . All in all this movie was a giant waste of time and money . Boo .
pos	I have to admit , I was n't expecting much going into this film viewing in my Japenese film class , but this film really blew me away . The director does a wonderful job following through with the title of his film , truly portraying a picture of madness . I think the fact that this film is silent adds to the resemblance of madness , helping the viewer experience the characters inner world rather than the world outside his mind . This film just added to my feelings about foreign silent films vs. American , in that the foreign films work much more to exercise your mind and make you think rather than going for the fluffy film always with the happy ending , exercising the imagination very little .
neg	If there was a ZERO rating , I would give it to this movie . Today was the second time I tried to watch it and I still could n't make it through from beginning to end . I ca n't believe the multiple stars given by others & can only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise ! The acting is atrocious all around , the script is blah , the kid playing Nichole shows zero emotion even when she 's being threatened . The " southern " accent from the actress playing Amber 's mom is laughable - I 'm from Georgia and have friends from Texas - believe me NOBODY talks like that ! None of her emotions seemed real in any scene . The subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment .
pos	Yes , it 's another great magical Muppet 's movie and I adore them all ; the characters , the movies , the TV show episodes ( it 's the best comedy or musical TV show ever ) and all the artists behind it . But here they did such a rare fatal mistake and I 'm surely talking about the weird ending ! !   I think it 's very dangerous to involve that much , in American drama , and end a love affair by marriage ! ! We , as all the poor viewers , feel so free or maybe happy for the absence of its annoyance , peevishness and misery ! So we all enjoy these stories which gather 2 cute heroes as couple in love without the legitimate bond like Mickey Mouse and Minnie , Superman and Lois Lane , Dick Tracy and Tess , etc . So with all of the previous couples and their likes I bet that you feel safe , serenity and peace . Therefore when you look at what the makers of this movie had already done you 'll be as mad as me ! They made the weak miserable creature ( Kermit ) marry his daily nightmare , the most vexatious female ever ( Miss Piggy ) ! This is a historical change by the measures of the American entertainment 's industry ! And it was pretty normal to have a negative impact upon the audience whom just refused to bless or believe or being satisfied with that sudden marriage ( even the pathetic frog did n't have the time or the proper opportunity to think or to decide anything ! ) . Therefore no wonder at all when you know that this movie is the most failure one in their cinematic serious , grossing only 25 millions vis - à - vis 65 millions earned by the first one ( The Muppet Movie  1979 ) five years earlier ! ! Simply in this movie they took Manhattan , and my rest too !
neg	This would be a watchable Hollywood mediocre if it had a good editing . It relies on the typical American thriller plot - " who is going to outsmart everyone " . Acting is below average , but with shining appearance of the detective who is the best actor in the film and he is mostly responsible if the tension in the film rises . Film was completely suffocated by blank video and sound shots and most of it looks like raw film material . All in all , if you do n't mind watching a movie that looks like a student film project , this is a film to watch . I guess that would be enough to say on this film , everything else could really spoil the tension that is probably low enough .
pos	And this somebody is me . And not only me , as I can see here at IMDb or when leaving the theater . Why did the people love it ? It 's obvious : Everybody knows zombies by now ( at least the Horror fans by heart and the others through the " Dawn of the Dead " reinvention or Resident Evil movies etc . )   Or at least they thought they knew everything about zombies ... that is until this movie came along . And you 'll see zombies in a new light ( perhaps ) . This is not a horror movie , although it does contain some violent scenes , but is rather a comedy . A satire to be precise . And it never runs out of steam ! That is why I rated it so high . Pacing wise it 's incredible , the acting is great and the script has no ( obvious ) mistakes ... quite the contrary : It 's a gem and if you 're only a little bit interested in zombies you ought to see it ! And even if you dislike them , watch it ! Because it 's a great ( comedy ) movie !
neg	I can only believe that Garson Kanin must have been two people . The one who wrote the brilliant " A Double Life " and the funny " Born Yesterday " and co - wrote such excellent screenplays as " Adam 's Rib " and " Pat And Mike " with his wife Ruth Gordon and then the one who wrote and/or directed such tiresome , sad drivel as " Bachelor Mother " , " Some Kind Of A Nut " , and this . The cast tries , but the script is so tired and clichéd that even the efforts of the always wonderful Brenda Vaccaro are defeated . The script sinks to it 's nadir in the truly offensive sequence in which Janssen 's character tests Drivas 's character to make sure he 's not gay . An ugly sequence , but sadly one which could easily play in a film today . " Ethnic " jokes are now totally verboten , but " fag " jokes are still " good , clean , family fun " .
pos	Although I gave a rating of " 9 " , my expectations were higher than what the film delivered . I would have been happier had there been more deep diving since I am a diver myself , but it was supposed to portray the life of Carl Brashear and that 's what it was about . This film made me angry in the beginning , but happy in the end .
neg	I have never seen such terrible performances in all my life . Everyone in the entire film was absolute rubbish . Not one decent actor / actress in the whole film , it was a joke . Reminded me of drama at school ...
pos	This is a very exciting and romantic film . I have seen it several times and never get bored with it . Everything is realistic and it is a good plot . The actors are excellent Liam Neeson , Jessica Lange , Tim Roth and Brian Cox . I actually prefer this film to Braveheart as Braveheart contain so many historical misstakes . There is many exciting scenes - watch out for the Bridge Scen and the last fencing scene . This is really good and surprising scenes . The music are lovely ... it really suits to the movie . The setting is amazing .
neg	It seems like anybody can make a movie nowadays . It 's like all you need is a camera , a group of people to be your cast and crew , a script , and a little money and walla you have a movie . Problem is that talent is n't always part of this equation and often times these kind of low budget films turn out to be duds . The video store shelves are filled with these so called films . These are n't even guilty pleasures , they 're just a waste of celluloid that are better off forgotten . Troma Entertainment is known for making trash cinema , but most of their films are b movie gold . However , some of the films they 've put out they had nothing to do with making and some , like ' Nightmare Weekend , ' did n't deserve any form of release at all .   Pros : The cast members do the best they can with the lousy material . Some unintentional hilarity . Moves at a good pace ( Should at 81 minutes ) . Cons : Awful writing , which includes putrid dialogue and countless plot holes . Poorly lit , especially the night scenes and the ending , which you ca n't make out at all . Does n't make a lick of sense . Badly scored . Cheap and very dated effects . Total lack of character development and you wo n't care about anybody . This is supposed to be a horror film , but it 's lacking in that area and is n't the least bit scary . Nothing interesting or exciting happens . Loaded with unnecessary padding . Final thoughts : I never expected this to be some forgotten gem , but I never imagined it would be this bad . I do n't know if it 's the worst film ever made , but it 's a definite contender . Troma should have let this film rot instead of giving it a release . Do n't make the same mistake I did and let your curiosity get the best of you . My rating : 1/5
pos	I first read Pearl S Buck 's splendid novel in my ninth grade history class , and I enjoyed every thrilling page of it . It was almost inevitable that Hollywood would get hold of it , and considering that it was made in 1937 , the results are excellent . Certain things have to be accepted : in 1937 there was no question of casting Asian actors in a major Hollywood film . In a way this renders the end product rather more interesting than if they had been able to use a more authentic - looking cast . With that obstacle to overcome , executive producer Irving Thalberg and director Sidney Franklin ( among others ) took the trouble to hand - pick a splendid and stellar cast . Paul Muni plays Wang Lung . Muni was at the peak of his powers as an actor during this period , and could very nearly play anything he put his mind to . Once you get past the makeup ( it 's good , but no one is going to really mistake him for a Chinese man ) , his performance has all the verisimilitude of his best work . Then there is Luise Rainer . Coming off an Oscar win the previous year for her performance in THE GREAT ZIEGFELD , the Viennese actress 's star was on the rise and she was given the plum role of O - lan despite her lack of experience in Hollywood . Her performance won her a second consecutive Oscar , the first time in history that happened . Much criticism has been leveled at Rainer 's performance , and her Oscar win here . She has been called wooden and one - note . There is a small grain of truth in that . HOWEVER , that being said , all you need to do is go back to the book . For Rainer , though not Chinese , played O - lan pretty much as Buck wrote her ; it is in fact a splendid performance , and one of the best transfers from book to screen I have ever witnessed . As for the rest of the cast , well this was MGM . They had the biggest roster of stars and character actors in Hollywood at the time , and a big budget to pay for the best , and in the end they got the best . The film softens Wang Lung 's marriage to O - lan somewhat . In the novel , with wealth come the lusts of the flesh and he takes on a concubine , a move which devastates his wife but her feelings as a mere woman do not concern him . In the film , a contrite Wang Lung returns to his wife on her deathbed the two pearls he had taken from her years before , realizing too late that she was his true love . Corny , yes . But that 's Hollywood . Considering the obstacles they were up against , the film might well have opened to screams of laughter . But despite the noticeable dearth of real Asians in the cast , this film has worn surprisingly well with the passage of seventy - three years . In fact the most amazing thing about this film is how good it is , when it might so easily have been a disaster .
neg	I have seen bad films but this took the p***. Made no sense , and all the characters do is swear every couple of seconds , oh and i think one has a low sperm count . Its that good . A welshman plays a sweary cockney . A posh english bloke plays a foul mouthed unlovable rogue of a paddy , and some lesser lights play dim tarts . And there are some Russian gangsters . Oh yes some one has a gun and maybe talks rubbish whilst high on drugs . Avoid this film like the plague .
pos	Based on fact , this is the story of a teenager named Homer Hickam ( Jake Gyllenhaal ) , growing up in a coal town in West Virginia where a boy 's usual destiny was to " end up in the mines . " But Homer had his eye on the sky and a love for flying rockets , to the dismay of his mine - foreman father , and the consternation of the townsfolk generally . A misfit for sure , he and three of his equally outcast buddies begin making rockets , which they fly from a patch of barren land eight miles out of town , so as to no longer terrorize the community with their oft - times errant rockets . Unfortunately , most of the town and especially Homer 's father ( Chris Cooper ) thinks that they are wasting their time . However , the people become intrigued and soon start coming out in droves to watch the ' Rocketboys ' send off their homemade missiles . Only one teacher ( Laura Dern ) in the high school understands their efforts and lets them know that they could become contenders in the national science fair with college scholarships being the prize . Now the gang must learn to perfect their craft and overcome the many problems facing them as they shoot for the stars . Director Joe Johnston has always been a famous name for his movies such as Jumanji & Jurassic Park 3 & " October Sky " surely stands above all of his other films . Without any doubts , " October Sky " is his best effort & obviously his best film . It 's not only a true story filmed extremely well , but even as a movie , it has every single thing , which is required for a top level cinema . And along with Johnston 's extra - ordinary direction , are some exceptional performances . Jake Gyllenhaal was around 19 , when this movie was released & he gives a beautiful & natural performance . He is a perfect actor . Chris Cooper as his father , also gives a very fine performance . The same goes for Laura Dern & also she looks beautiful . Even the rest of the performances are extremely well . The background score was fine . Highly inspiring movie , which lifts up your spirit sky high . One of those movies which definitely inspires you for all of your life . An amazing inspiring movie along with loads of entertainment . Not to be missed .
neg	CLASS OF ' 61   Aspect ratio : 1.33:1 Sound format : Stereo In 1861 , class members from the West Point Academy are torn apart by the outbreak of the Civil War . Gregory Hoblit 's OK historical drama makes an obvious point - virtuous men are rendered blind by conflict - though the production seems a little stilted , despite authentic period detail and a cast of talented newcomers ( Clive Owen , Christien Anholt , Josh Lucas , Andre Braugher , Laura Linney , etc . ) , toplined by Dan Futterman as a conscientious Southerner who takes up arms in defence of slavery , pitting him in direct conflict with his former Northern friends . The movie 's emphasis on such a misguided - though sympathetic - character is particularly brave , but the drama is otherwise flat and superficial , and Hoblit 's direction is efficient rather than inspired .
pos	King of Masks ( Bian Lian in China ) is a shockingly beautiful and profoundly touching film . Winner of 16 awards from around the world , this film based on a true story centers on Wang Bianlian , a street performer in 1930s China who is growing older but has no heir to pass on his art of face - change opera . He has a unique talent of quickly changing masks in performance , and no one knows how he does it . He has a longing desire to have a grandson , as his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir . We then go to the streets , and see that people are selling their children because they ca n't afford to take care of them : some are even begging to take their daughters for free , because daughters are not worth much in this society . Wang Bianlian 's story goes on from there . The film was so astonishingly good , the acting was amazing , and the issues were so weighty and well - addressed . There is the gender inequality and the depressing fact that in this time and place , no one wants a little girl . Also interesting to note is that the famed opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the Living Bodhisattva is a man who dresses as a woman , and while he is famous and well - respected , he regards himself as something low , a half woman . As we go further into the film , the face the issues of human slave trade and its demand and thus the lack of a possible solution for it , the brutality and corruption of the military and police , and the helplessness and lack of power any individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions . This is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life , and Xu Zhu , the actor who plays Wang Bianlian , presents yet another beautiful performance .
neg	When I saw this trailer on TV I was surprised . In May of 2008 I was at Six Flags in New Jersey and this was showing at a 4-D attraction ( you know , the attraction that the seats move ) . I take it that the version I saw was a shortened version ( 15 min . ) and also re - created to add the motion effects . It was a cute movie ... but that was it . It was educational and told about the first mission but the ending of a CGI spacewalk seemed a bit ... well ... trite . I was not a big fan of the movie but i would recommend this movie for any parent wanting to inform their children in a fun way about the first moonwalk . I will say , the character actors were well selected and the characters themselves were cute . So all - in - all , I would say , if you want to bring the younger kids ... go for it . But if you are wanting to take your older kids , take them to another movie ... they will thank you .

neg	Where to begin ? How about with the erroneous synopsis :   " X - Men Origins : Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine 's epically violent and romantic past , his complex relationship with Victor Creed , and the ominous Weapon X program . " His epically violent past turns out to exceptionally non - violent . His relationship with Creed is so glossed over it 's difficult to understand how they have any connection at all . We are thrown from one point in the opening scene that shows them as children on the run , to a montage of war scenes that they have fought in throughout their long lifespan , and finally to the present where they are a part of a hardcore government team of assassins . There is nothing by way of showing their relationship as brothers at all . Nothing complex is laid down for us to believe is authentic or even loving .   The romantic element of the movie between Silverfox and Wolverine was forced and abrupt . We are thrown into a romance so fast that it 's over before you can blink an eye . Having just introduced the character , Silverfox is killed off roughly fifteen minutes later . We are left wondering why we should care about this . Who was she anyway ? For a pivotal element of this weak revenge driven story , the romance is surprisingly unexplored . It was rushed in simply because it was required . Oddly enough , when Wolverine finds that his love is dead he leaves her in the woods to rot as he goes off to find Sabertooth . Being the romantic that he is this was out of character for him yet necessary to serve the plot in pulling off a very predictable surprise . As for the weapon X program , lets just say that after the painfully crippling procedure Wolverine is up and running . Eventually he arrives at the home of a conveniently old yet overwhelmingly loving couple . Surprisingly Ma and Pa Kent are n't alarmed when finding a naked sweaty man in their barn . Is it any wonder what fate awaits them ? In the previous films and the comic books , the main reason that Wolverines ' amnesia plagued him partly hinged on the fact that he was said to have been viciously evil and coldblooded . Knowing this was the case ... did he really want to remember such horrors or keep them hidden and continue his current more positive lifestyle of fighting against the villains of the world alongside his team mates ? As hinted to in X2 : X - men United when Stryker gives up some of his secrets it is said that Wolverine would be disturbed if he had known of the evil works they committed together . This film sets up the team fairly well only they do n't really do much of anything . No disturbing violence , no ruthless actions , they merely harass a few natives in foreign lands for the ten or fifteen minutes they are on screen .   It seems that Wolverine was n't an evil man under Stryker at all . Instead he was constantly trying to put a leash on his brother Sabertooth which consequently WAS the violent agent we all thought Wolverine was . Eventually he just leaves all together . No conflict of duality here at all . Idiotically REMOVING that character conflict of good and evil DULLED the story immensely . They may as well have given him rubber claws . There were a ton of other errors in this film that contradicted the X - Men trilogy , including the introduction of one of the lamest Deus Ex Machinas to ever hit a script . Magic memory - erasing bullets .   Really ? Apparently they are the only thing to bring down Wolverine . Yet this was apparently forgotten when agent after agent was sent to bring him down with bullets and bombs that would surely not work on him at all . Another problem with this film is that it tried to focus on Wolverine while throwing in a ton of other mutants which did little to nothing at all . Interesting characters were mere window dressing and did nothing for the story . Most were in the film for 5 - 10 minutes max and yet you find yourself wishing we saw more of them and less of Wolverine . Fred Dukes ( the Blob but not the comic version ) can punch a launched tank missile with little to no physical damage to him at all , but a simple headbutt from Wolverines metal noggin is enough to daze him ? Cyclops optic beams ( which instead of being concussive force are now more akin to lasers ) can burn through buildings but when fired at Sabertooth directly it simply smashes him into the ground without even damaging his clothes . Adamantium trench coats anyone ? The ( gravity defying ) mutant Gambit , instead of utilizing his signature cards , is made into some sort of crazy acrobat . In one poorly edited scene he is knocked unconscious by Wolverine ... then amazingly enough a few minutes later he is on a rooftop running TOWARDS Wolverine . How he regained consciousness , ran away a few blocks , climbed up a building , then ran back to Wolverine and Sabertooth in the middle of a scratching match is a mystery yet to be explained . Some have excused this films weakness by claiming it was made from a comic and therefore should be weak on character and heavy on flash . The idea that this movie being a comic film is flimsy and superficial because of that fact is incorrect . The comic book source material , the REAL origin of Wolverine ... is a story worth bringing to the screen . It does n't sugar coat his past nor treat the reader like mindless CGI junkies . It is a well crafted story and although retold and readjusted over time , began with WEAPON X by Barry Windsor - Smith . A much more intense and exciting story . This FOX film should seriously be forgotten .   Anyone have that magic gun ? 4/10
pos	I liked the movie , first of all because it told an interesting story , but the story as told in the movie felt like it was condensed from a much - longer story . Since the book is over 400 pages , that makes sense . It spans a time period from the 1920s to the 1970s , in a fictional South American country , also a lot to fit into the time available . I think it would have been much better as a six - hour mini - series than it turned out as a 140-minute movie . Even though it 's rushed , the story does n't skip so much that it gets confusing . What is told is told fairly well . One fault is that Clara 's supernatural powers appear inconsistently ; either they should have appeared more evenly through the course of the movie , or they should have been left out . Two more faults ( which could be spoilers ) : Esteban 's eventual return to goodness happens somewhat too suddenly , and Ferula 's curse seems to wear off , even though the tone of the story suggests that it should endure forever . The acting is excellent . Glenn Close , as the tormented spinster Ferula , is outstanding . Jeremy Irons , as the brutal self - made rich man , is also excellent . Meryl Streep , as the main character Clara , is great , although she 's often even better than she was in this movie . There were many well - performed smaller roles too . The biggest fault is that the movie seemed to lack a dialect coach ; each actor seemed to speak in a different sort of accent .
neg	The cliché of the shell - shocked soldier home from the war is here given dull treatment . Pity a splendid cast , acting to the limits of their high talents , ca n't redeem ' The Return of the Soldier ' from its stiff - collared inability to move the viewer to emotional involvement . Best moments , as another reviewer noted , come when Glenda Jackson is on screen ; but even Jackson 's crackling good cinematic power ca n't pull this film 's chestnuts from its cold , never warmed hearth . Ann - Margret , she of sex - kitten repute and too often accused of lacking acting ability , finds her actual and rather profound abilities wasted here - despite her speaking with a nigh - flawless Middlesex accent . The hackneyed score , redolent of many lackluster TV miniseries ' slathered - on saccharine emotionalism , is at irritating odds with the emotional remoteness of the script , blocking , and overbaked formalism of the direction ; except for its score and corseted script and direction , ' The Return of the Soldier ' has all the right bits but it fails to make them work together .
pos	In Le Million , Rene Clair , one of the cinema 's great directors and great pioneers , created a gem of light comedy which for all its lightness is a groundbreaking and technically brilliant film which clearly influenced subsequent film - makers such as the Marx Brothers , Lubitsch , and Mamoulian . The plot , a witty story of a poor artist who wins a huge lottery jackpot but has to search frantically all over town for the missing ticket , is basically just a device to support a series of wonderfully witty comic scenes enacted in a dream world of the director 's imagination . One of the most impressive things about this film is that , though it is set in the middle of Paris and includes nothing actually impossible , it achieves a sustained and involving fairy - tale / fantasy atmosphere , in which it seems quite natural that people sing as much as they talk , or that a tussle over a stolen jacket should take on the form of a football game . Another memorable element is that Le Million includes what may be the funniest opera ever put on film ( O that blonde - braided soprano ! " I laugh , ha ! ha ! " ) Also a delight is the casting : Clair has assembled a group of amazing , sharply different character actors , each of them illustrating with deadly satiric accuracy a bourgeois French " type , " so that the film seems like a set of Daumier prints come to life . The hilarity takes a little while to get rolling , and I found the characters not as emotionally engaging as they can be even in a light comedy ( as they are , for instance , in many Lubitsch films . ) For these reasons I refrained from giving it the highest rating . But these minor cavils should n't distract from an enthusiastic recommendation . Should you see it ? By all means . Highly recommended whether you want a classic and influential work of cinema or just a fun comedy .
neg	After reading through many of the reviews , I do n't know what movie some people were watching , but clearly it was n't the same one I saw . This movie is horrible . The acting , primarily Moore 's , is just terrible . The woman can not act . Nice tits , but she just ca n't act . At no point did she come across as the actual character . Instead , it was spoiled Hollywood actress goes to the beach to play make - believe with the boys . And that 's what this movie ultimately is -- Hollywood make - believe . The training sequences are over the top . The politics -- over the top . The political correctness -- over the top . The combat scenes -- you guessed it , over the top . Your mission is to get in and get out without being detected . So what do you do ? Why shoot off as many rounds and make as much noise as possible , of course . Oh G.I. Jane , you can be my wing man anytime . The premise is good , but as soon as Hollywood gets a hold of it , we end up with Top Gun with tits . What more is to be expected from commercial US films anymore ? Not much I guess .
pos	He now has a name , an identity , some memories and a a lost girlfriend . All he wanted was to disappear , but still , they traced him and destroyed the world he hardly built . Now he wants some explanation , and to get ride of the people how made him what he is . Yeah , Jason Bourne is back , and this time , he 's here with a vengeance . OK , this movie does n't have the most elaborated script in the world , but its thematics are very clever and ask some serious questions about our society . Of course , like every Hollywoodian movie since the end of the 90 's , " The Bourne Suprematy " is a super - heroes story . Jason Bourne is a Captain - America project - like , who 's gone completely wrong . In the first movie , the hero discovered his abilities and he accepted them in the second one . He now fights against what he considers like evil , after a person close to him has been killed ( his girlfriend in " Suprematy " ) by them . That 's all a part of the super - hero story , including a character with ( realistic but still impressive : he almost invincible ) super powers . And the interesting point is that the evil he fights all across the world ( there 's no frontiers in the Bourne 's movies , characters are going from one continent to another in the blink of an eye ) , is , as in the best seasons of " 24 " , an American enemy , who 's beliefs that he fight for the good of his country completely blinds him . Funny how " mad patriots " are now the N.1 enemies of paranoiac Hollywood 's stories . Beside all those interesting thematics , the movie is n't flawless : the feminine character of Nickie Parson is for now on completely useless and the direction is quite unoriginal when it comes to dialogs scenes . But all that does n't really matter , for " The Bourne Ultimatum " is an action movie . And the action scenes are rather impressive . Everyone here is talking about the " Waterloo scene " and the " Tanger pursuit " and everyone 's right . I particularly enjoyed the fight in Tanger , that reminds my in its exaggeration and craziness the works of Tsui Hark . Visually inventive scenes , lots of intelligent action parts and a good reflection on American 's contemporary thematics : " The Bourne Ultimatum " is definitely the best movie of the series and a very interesting and original action flick .
neg	Not exactly my genre , this straight - to - DVD street fight action is one I only encountered due to a friend putting it on whilst we had a few beers . I 'm relatively open minded , and quite a fan of Eamonn Walker , so I sat back ready to enjoy myself . Blood and Bone is the story of Isiah Bone , an ex - con who becomes a street fighter for unclear reasons which eventually unfold as the film progresses . Blah blah blah . What a tedious film . I understand that films like this do n't rely hugely on plot , but do they have to stuff in such a silly , predictable and entirely stupid storyline ? It may not be important , but by golly gum does it annoy me . Better no plot and pure action than a clíche - ridden fleabag mongrel of a narrative . Infused with entirely unfounded and unachieving sentimental drivel , it is the cinematic equivalent of a thin - skinned turkey stuffed with rotten innards . I should probably at this point mention what is , of course , the film 's drawing point : the fighting . Even in itself , the fighting is rather poor . Bone manages to take out well established tough - man street fighters in single punches ( a large oaf or two is the filmmakers ' laughworthy attempt to rectify this inconsistency ) ; fighters who never seem to conclude that attacking one by one is a foolish ploy . Even this is repetitive and stupid , arms broken and faces kicked with a steady alacrity that we get to see time and time again . A run of the mill , film - by - numbers movie which fully deserves its straight to DVD status , doing absolutely nothing new and everything we 've seen time and time again . And not even particularly well .
pos	So I flipped on the digital subscriber channels one night a couple of years ago and thought I 'd pass a half hour watching " Girlfight " while waiting for " Hart 's War " to start . With a title like that I figured it was some exploitation ' B ' flic about inner city girl gangs . Much to my surprise it was n't about that at all . Instead it is a well acted , well scripted story about a young woman who almost accidentally gets into female boxing . She is responsible for taking her younger brother to his practice sessions and get interested while observing his bouts . As he does n't really want to be a boxer ( only following through on their father 's wishes ) she convinces his coach to take her on in his stead .   The story unfolds in an intelligent and believable way as she goes through various trials on her quest . For starters , her brother 's coach does n't want to take on a female boxer . After grudgingly doing so there is the problem of lining up matches for her . Then the confrontation with her father when he finds out what is going on . Yes , a love interest develops but it serves to enhance the plot , coming across more of an interesting inter - human reaction with its own fight related consequences . All in all this is a great little sleeper movie that few seem to have heard of . Some time later when I saw the much advertised and acclaimed " Million Dollar Baby " I thought " wait a minute , this seems kind of familiar " . Needless to say , I did n't watch " Hart 's War " that night .
neg	Once upon a time in the mid 1990s I used to write for DOCTOR WHO fanzines and the whole of fandom was holding its breathe about the new American produced DOCTOR WHO TVM . As soon as it was announced that the Doctor`s arch enemy the Master was going to be played by Eric Roberts everyone scratched their heads and exclaimed " Who is Eric Roberts ? " . I should point out this was before the IMDB came online when all you had to do was type in a name into this website to their resume , but one helpful soul wrote into a publication I wrote for to explain that Eric Roberts was best known for a role where he starred opposite F Murray Abraham , the film was called BY THE SWORD and was about a fencing school . Actually looking back now Roberts is best known for THE POPE OF GREENWICH VILLAGE and RUNAWAY TRAIN but that didn`t stop the person putting the boot into both Roberts and BY THE SWORD and his mind was made up that this American Master with his southern drawl was going to a debacle . Strangely most fans were furious about Roberts playing the Master but after they saw the DOCTOR WHO TVM a great many fans ( Myself among them ) thought Roberts performance was the best thing about the disappointing American production   Yeah I`m digressing but BY THE SWORD was a film that I wanted to see simply because it was the first time I`d heard the name of Eric Roberts but I didn`t get the chance to see it untill this weekend and I was fairly disappointed with it . I know nothing about fencing ( Everyone else on this page seems duty bound to mention if they fence or not . I don`t fence ) so I don`t know how accurate it all is , but as mentioned the film feels somewhat anachronistic even if you saw it on its release in 1991 , the hairstyles seem a few years out of date along with its mixed teenage cast doing a little dance routine that makes you wonder if it wouldn`t have worked a lot better if it`d had been produced by Jerry Bruckheimer in the mid 1980s . You could argue this would have meant the relationship between Max Suba and Alexander Villard being off centre for most of the film but I wasn`t convinced about their love / hate relationship and Abraham and Roberts have given much better performances before and since BY THE SWORD
pos	In " Brave New Girl , " Holly comes from a small town in Texas , sings " The Yellow Rose of Texas " at a local competition , and gets admitted to a prestigious arts college in Philadelphia . From there the movie grows into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty . I loved this movie . It was full of great singing and acting and characters that kept it moving at a very nice pace . The acting was , of course , wonderful . Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun were outstanding , as well as Nick Roth The camera work was really done well and I was very pleased with the end ( It seems a sequel could be in the making ) . Kudos to the director and all others that participated on this production . Quite a gem in the film archives .
neg	( Spoiler included , some would say ) This film is not possible to take seriously . At some parts it is so awfully stupid that I just ca n't help laughing at it all . Try me for the sequence where Stallone 's character jumps some 20 meters with full climbing gear or ( and this is really my favorite ) snuffs a bad guy by sticking him onto a stalactite . Yeah , what ungodly strength did he muster to accomplish such feats ? I dunno , but he sure gives reality a run for the money .
pos	This movie has great style , fantastic visuals and hot sex scenes with a beautiful woman . It falters at the end as the story twists get a little bit extreme .. but all in all , I would recommend this movie just because it has that good old Russian feel to it .. big , impressive , powerful , bleak and brutal and at the same time beautiful in the old tradition of tragic beauty . PLOT : A guy who can make a blade shoot out of his hand at will ( not a spoiler since they show it in the trailer ) when he is REALLY mad at you tries to have a girlfriend .. he discovers that after you kill one person with your sword hand , it 's kind of hard to keep a stable relationship .... Sword boy is on the planet for a reason .. he just does n't know what it is .. YET . Lots of dark street fights with guys unexpectedly getting filleted creatively . RUSSAIN w ENG subtitles .. slick worth a watch ..
neg	Everything about this film was terrible . To start with this film had a pretty good cast and I find it impossible to make such a great cast into the biggest disaster to the gangster film genre ever . The sound track was like one of a very bad slap stick comedy . It had this music through the whole film and it started to get quite irritating . PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT INFLICT YOURSELF WITH THIS DISASTER YOU WILL ONLY BE HURT
pos	While this is a faithful adaptation , it is much less exciting than Greene 's novel . Also , it 's a bit ridiculous when people say things to Boyer like , " You 're Spanish , are n't you ? " Still , the movie 's not at all bad , just slow - moving .
neg	A film with very little positive to say for it . Firstly it has zero pace and is positively lacking in any drama . Besides being remarkably slow The Empty Acre seems dedicated to using the same stock footage again and again . I lost count of how many times I had seen " that " field at night or that bit of cracked earth . It also has the fundamental flaw of thinking that if the audience do n't know about things they will be gripped rather than just confused . So with no signs that there are any issues we suddenly find the marriage is not what it seems to be despite being given the impression that it 's fine . We find Jacob is possibly the worst farmer in the universe as he seems to spend no time on the farm and also seems to have bought land with a wholly useless acre . Beth has a key to a warehouse of books ? There are innumerable other questions some of which are resolved later in the movie , much later , in fact too late . And on the point of the acre . Horror filmmakers note that large inanimate objects are inherently not scary  and also if they 're meant to be an acre big then make them so . There is also a frightening lack of reasonability as Beth ( the best performer in the piece , followed by Jefferson  the cop ) suddenly appears to be accused of everything under the sun just because she is on " medication " . With the full ten minutes plus of running round the fields looking for the missing child ( did he crawl out of the window ? He 's six months old ) the film descends into badly written scene after badly written scene . Bad plinky plonk " horror " music fails to add atmosphere . Often bad films can be amusing but not The Empty Acre , which is just bad .
pos	Sure , the history in this movie was " Hollywoodized "-- but it 's far from being the only bit of history rewritten for the masses . Lafitte sided with the Americans because he considered himself a Frenchman and therefore hated the British , not because of any sense of patriotism for a nation that had taken over New Orleans only a short time ago ; he broke his agreement and returned to smuggling , which caused his sailing to Galveston ; he was more of a petty criminal and scoundrel than a hero * or * a swashbuckler . But who cares ? This is one movie that 's sheer entertainment -- and face it , we all wanted Jean to go for the feisty wench rather than the prudish daughter of the governor . Brynner once again rises over mediocre writing to give a fascinating performance .
neg	I am very disappointed with " K-911 . " The original " good " quality of " K-9 " does n't exist any more . This is more like a sitcom ! Some of casts from original movie returned and got some of my memory back . The captain of Dooley now loves to hit him like a scene from old comedy show . That was crazy . What 's the deal with the change of Police ? It seems like they are now LAPD ! Not San Diego PD . It is a completely different movie from "
pos	The Theory Of Flight is an engaging character study of an artist ( Branagh ) yearning to break free of boredom and mediocrity , and a terminally ill patient ( Bonham - Carter ) in the last stages of ASL , confined to a wheelchair , who desires to make love to a man before dying . Helena Bonham - Carter exudes wit , defiance , and independence as an ASL patient who is virtually dependent upon people around her to take care of her . Kenneth Branagh , sentenced through community service to take part in caring for her , complements Helena 's charm with woeful melancholy , creating a sentimental , compelling love story in which two people try to help each other find the road to happiness , before time runs out .
neg	After watching this on the MST3 K episode , I have to wonder how many movies this film borrows from . It seems to combine elements of Logans Run , Farenheight 451 , Final Sacrifice and at least several others . At one point I was really expecting Cris Makepease to call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER .   I wonder if the director has any clue how many holes there are in the plot . like the fact that , even though gas is unavailable , there is plenty of it in abandoned gas stations , and the stations are located close enough together to keep an F1 race car going all the way across the country .
pos	This is a brilliant political satire . No wonder why it was largely ignored in the U.S. : it exposes our murderous foreign policy for what it really is . Another good film from this era , Rendition , was also totally dismissed simply because it showed , accurately , that the U.S. is a war machine bent on torturing , murdering , and maiming civilians in its quest for total world domination . A clever plot , good acting , some big stars ( John Cusack , Ben Kingsley , Marisa Tomei anyone ? ) and some scenes of hilarity should have made this movie a hit . Unfortunately , Americans do n't like to hear the truth about themselves , especially when they are complicit in mass murder .
neg	Shlock - merchant Leo Fulci takes a change of pace by making a trashy , barely coherent sword and sorcery fantasy movie instead of his usual trashy , barely coherent horror .   A wimpy Orlando Bloom type called Ilias , from some society vaguely resembling Ancient Greece travels across the ocean to caveman territory on some vaguely defined quest to battle evil , where he joins up with a animal loving hunter to battle the wolf - man and mutant minions of a vampiric topless evil sorceress . Wackiness ensues . The sorceress , is oppressing the local cavemen and wants the magic bow for herself . She sends various minions , each weirder than the last , after our heroes who win through in the end , striking a blow for oppressed cavemen everywhere . This movie contains a steady stream of WTF ? elements and moments . For some reason the entire movie is shot in soft focus and the picture is further blurred by the constant presence of mist on screen . This may have been an attempt to create atmosphere or to hide how fake everything looks . Either way , it failed . There is no atmosphere , unless it is one of scuzziness and mild bewilderment and there is no hiding how lame everything looks . The wolf - man minions look like a poor man 's wookie . For some reason the director fell in love with shots of them leaping through the air in slow motion , Six Million Dollar Man style , toward our heroes when they attack . There are probably about a dozen of these shots throughout the movie and it gets goofier every time . The other minions of the topless sorceress , other than the generic leather clad humans , are some lumpy white mutants who appear to be covered in cobwebs . Needless to say they are slow and unthreatening and when they speak sound like gay Hispanic , lisping Daleks . The fights are stilted and unconvincing and the special effects are woeful . Oh yeah , the music is cheap synthesiser stuff that the makers of Doctor Who would have been embarrassed to have used . Ilias , our nominal hero is bland and forgettable . He also looks a complete wuss , especially with his midriff revealing leather outfit and big hair , and is clearly a moron . Sure , he 's a dynamite shot with his magical bow but he only takes about three or four arrows with him in his mission to battle this entire continent of evil . Needless to say he runs out of arrows within a few minutes and has to be saved by more traditional sword and sorcery hero , Mace . When he meets Ilias he establishes himself as the taciturn loner type , claiming he has no friends but no sooner can you say latent homoerotic subtext they are bosom buddies , traipsing the misty hills together . Mace promises to take Ilias with him in return for bow related favours . Ilias asks where he is going . " Wherever my legs take me , " is his reply . Good enough for Ilias . Mace is also animal lover and outrageous hypocrite . He proclaims his great love of and affinity toward animals , citing the usual stuff about how he prefers them to humans because humans can be soooo mean . He says he would never hunt and kill an animal to feed himself but he will steal meat off other people who have hunted down animals . He is also not above randomly killing innocent passers by for no good reason . Not long after they meet , he is testing out Ilias ' bow and the movie cuts to some random caveman , minding his own business , walking along and Mace shoots him dead . There is no indication this poor soul did anything to deserve this and even Ilias , who supposedly hails from a more moral and civilised society does n't even raise an eyebrow .   The films villainess is quite unusual . For the entire movie she is completely naked except from a g - string and a golden mask that encompasses her entire head . It 's like Fulci included her to make the movies obligatory T&A quotient but decided she was bit too much of a butterface at the last minute . She spends a lot of time seemingly being pleasured by her pet snakes and dreaming about being shot by a faceless bow wielding man who is dressed like Ilias . Wow , such symbolism ! Later on in the movie she wimps out when she ca n't beat Ilias and Mace and promises to make herself the sex - slave of some ancient warrior dude if he kills them for her . Hardly the world 's most scary villain and not really a step forward for women 's rights . I think he sic 's the cobweb creatures on our heroes and impersonates Mace in a situation where there is no no - one else around but Mace to fool . Was he really worthy trading your self respect for , Ocron ?   There are quite a few other WTF ? moments . Most of them come toward the end of the movie . Ilias wusses out , I forget why , possibly his permed hairdo got mussed , but realizes the error of his ways and returns to aid Mace in fighting the forces of evil . All of a sudden , for no reason , his bow can suddenly fire out multiple target seeking bolts of energy . The bolts can also shoot through solid rock when necessary . Needless to say his makes short work of the hordes of bad guys who have captured Mace . The climax is also rather nonsensical . Mace decimates Ocron 's remaining forces using the bows targeted laser attack capability . He then is able to shoot Ocron from a kilometre away using its shoot through rock capacity . She starts dying . Her mask is ripped of revealing a hideous Muppet head . She staggers around screaming and turns into a dog and wanders off with another dog . Mace smiles . Roll credits . Strangely enough as far as these dodgy low budget sword and sorcery movies this one is reasonably lucid and focused . Any one who has seen Wizards of the Lost Kingdom can tell you how nonsensical and meandering these movies can truly be .
pos	I am of " the Christopher Reeve Generation " it is fair to say that he was the best actor to play Superman yet , but that does n't stop me from enjoying other actors in the role , and George Reeves makes a pretty good bid to knock Chris off the top , though he just barely falls short . That does n't stop me from enjoying this film , it has a lot going for it . It has all that a movie needs , a plot with beginning , middle , and end , plus all those parts are intelligently written . The film is edgy both in acting and storyline , something a film - noir but with tights . The story is both exciting and meaningful , this is a movie with a message that is n't too preachy . I am still amazed this was shot over 12 days , oh the glory days of Hollywood , when we did n't have to wait 5 years just to see if the movie would fall into development hell ... The film is polished and expertly made , directed by Lee " Roll'em " Sholem , best known for directing with both speed and efficiency . It never lets the constraints of technology slow it down , in fact there is some creative things done to create the effect of flight , including putting a camera on a boom on a truck and shooting high and traveling fast to make it look like we are seeing it from Superman 's point of view , also a few closeups of George in process work , and a long shot of an animated Superman .   This is now available on DVD as an extra feature on the first season of the George Reeves Television series . A DVD worth owning in its own right , the inclusion of the film as its original whole , is icing on the cake . Give Blood Today God Bless !
neg	SHALLOW GRAVE begins with either a tribute or a rip off of the shower scene in PSYCHO . ( I 'm leaning toward rip off . ) After that it gets worse and then surprisingly gets better , almost to the point of being original . Bad acting and amateurish directing bog down a fairly interesting little story , but the film already surpasses many in the " Yankee comes down South to get killed by a bunch of rednecks " genre because it is actually shot in the South . A group of college girls head to Ft . Lauderdale for summer vacation and are waylaid in Georgia by a flat tire after getting off the main road . ( Note to Yankees : stay on the highway when you go to Florida . ) Sue Ellen ( Lisa Stahl ) has to pee so she heads into the woods . When she finally finds a good spot to do her business she witnesses the local sheriff ( Tony March ) strangle his mistress ( Merry Rozelle ) to death . ( Note to Yankees : do not wander off into the woods when in the South ; not because you might witness a murder , but you may run across a marijuana plantation . ) This is the point where the story , not the movie , actually comes close to being good . While Tony March will never have to practice his Oscar speech , his Sheriff Dean becomes a creepy facsimile of a normal guy torn by what he has done and what he must do . Tom Law is likable as Deputy Scott and is as authentic a Southern deputy as I 've seen since Walton Goggins ( Deputy Steve Naish ) in HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES . A few scenes in the movie are worth the mention . The girls stop at a BBQ in South Carolina and display their racism when a big black guy checks them out . Sue Ellen runs into a barn to hide behind some hay bales and in a shockingly realistic moment a large snake is hiding in the hay with her . And in the strangest scene , Sheriff Dean makes like he 's about to rape Patty ( Carol Cadby ) and tells her to take off her clothes . Dean has turned the radio up to drown out the noise of what he 's about to do . The preacher on the radio needs to go back and read his Bible . His sermon is about how Jezebel is saved by the blood of Jesus Christ . I feel sorry for this preacher 's flock . Jezebel was in the Old Testament a few thousand years before Christ was born and by no means is she one of the five people you are going to meet in Heaven .
pos	This film revolves as much around Japanese culture as it does the lives of one modern Japanese family . Physical contact is frowned upon for those over 7 ( especially in public ) hence all that bowing instead of hugging even when you are close friends/ relatives . Ballroom dancing involves putting your arms around someone else and that in public too ! Never the less Ballroom dancing is ( on the quite ) immensely popular . People who do Ballroom dancing in Japan are viewed a bit like nudists in the west ... many more would like to than do but are inhibited by the culture . A delightful family film , which any amateur dancer would enjoy for the dance sequences alone . I understand that it was more popular than Titanic in Japan . I guess the Japanese are just like the rest of us - they like to be hugged too .
neg	The film was made in 1942 and with World War 11 around , the movie industry decided to capitalize on the fact that spies were around . The film is fun to watch due to the fabulous dancing of Eleanor Powell . The late Miss Powell was certainly a great hoofer in every sense of the word . She is again paired with a very young looking Red Skelton here . The two of them also starred in " I Dood It . " Moroni Olsen , who 3 years later , was superb as the interrogating police officer in " Mildred Pierce " again appears as an officer asking Powell to deliver an item . Trouble is that Olsen and his rogues are really the Japanese spies . Bert Lahr is his usual brilliant self here and he gets ample support from Virginia O'Brien .
pos	Sunday would not be Sunday without an action movie , and when you want intense combat , you turn to Tom Berenger ( Platoon ) . Here he plays a sniper in the jungle going after rebels and drug lords . Life 's a bitch , so he gets a green office type ( Billy Zane ) to help on the mission . The film is in the hands of Luis Llosa , who stunk up Anaconda . he does n't do much better here , but Berenger makes the movie worthwhile . Sure , it may be a little long - who wants to see a lot of walking through the jungle , but is is good , tense action when the time is right .
neg	Bela Lugosi is great as usual but the movie is nothing compared to Dracula . He is probably the only one that played a perfect part in this movie but not even a legend like Lugosi could save the badness of the idea of this movie and unlike most old unspenseful horror films this movie does n't set the mood very well . Even at its worst any of Bela 's movies is only mediocre though .
pos	I was n't expecting to be so impacted by this film portraying a family just like the one you 'd expect to be living next door . They are ordinary flesh - and - blood people , not like the typical Hollywood fare . They face an all too common problem -- debilitating illness . But the story - line grips the heart with a powerful lesson . Casting , script , direction , and acting flow together with a surge that draws the viewer deep into the story . Give this film your full attention and its message will truly inspire .
neg	Bugs Bunny accidentally ends up at the South Pole while trying to vacation in Florida . Where he meets a little penquin , which he tries to save from an Eskimo . This short tries and the penquin is adorable , but in the end it 's a bit too light in the laughs department . The Eskimo is n't really that great of a foil for Bugs and I just seen a lot better Bugs Bunny cartoons frankly , even other shorts when he 's paired with other unknown antagonists . So I ca n't in good conscience recommend this one . However it is nice to see it in it 's uncut form . This cartoon is on Disk 3 of the " Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1 "   My Grade : C
pos	John Garfield plays a Marine who is blinded by a grenade while fighting on Guadalcanal and who has to learn to live with his disability . He has all the stereotypical notions about blindness , and is sure he 'll be a burden to everyone . The hospital staff and his fellow wounded Marines ca n't get through to him . Neither can his girl back home played by Eleanor Parker . He 's stubborn and blinded by his own fears , self pity , and prejudices . It 's a complex role that Garfield carries off memorably in a great performance that keeps one watching in spite of the ever present syrupy melodrama . The best scenes are on Guadalcanal , where he 's in a machine gun nest trying to fend off the advancing Japanese soldiers in a hellish looking night time battle , and later a dream sequence in the hospital where he sees himself walking down a train platform with a white cane , dark glasses , and holding out a tin cup , all the while his girlfriend walks backward away from the camera .
neg	I admire ' Kissing on the Mouth ' for its frankness  pubic hair cutting and masturbation , especially from the lead / director Joe Swanberg . They were n't afraid to show trueness to everyday " private " occurrences . Unfortunately , the film falls under the ' The Brown Bunny ' realm , though with a slightly more developed plot of jealousy . Yes , it mirrors ' Bunny ' with a whole lot of nothing going on , or too many cinematography shots focused ( or sincerely unfocused ) on absolutely nothing  feet , hands or genitals . Again , unfortunately , I can see why this film was released , and why people are renting : true life sex scenes and full frontal ( equally , both male and female ) nudity . Other than that , it was a complete waste of time . We quickly learn of a post - college male / female roommate pair in which the male has obvious feelings for the female that sees him as just a friend while continuously having sex with her ex - boyfriend . Other than that , we are subjected to the every - day events of their boring lives : she works for her parents ; he works on an extremely uninteresting sexual awareness project on his computer . For this all to work , the dialogue has to be interesting and the acting real . Neither work and it 's as boring as watching someone drive for an hour , i.e. ' The Brown Bunny . ' The only actor that stands out is Kate Winterich , and even she does some questionable acting . ( The DVD extra with her in front of a mike is actually worth watching / listening to . ) Again , I admire the filmmakers , especially Swanberg , for baring it all and not being afraid to expose themselves or shower - habits , but overall the film falls flat . It has narrations that does n't fit the scenes , too many boring everyday events and unconvincing acting that you wonder , other than the soft - porn factor , why you rented this .
pos	* * * Spoilers * My dad had taped this movie for me when I was 3 . By age 5 , I had watched it over 400 times . I just watched it and watched it . And I still do today ! It has a grim storyline , a lamb 's mother is killed by a wolf -- a very emotional scene -- and wants to become a wolf , like him . After years of training , the lamb is made into a really REALLY evil looking thing . He and the wolf travel to his old barn , but he can not kill the lambs , no matter how much he wishes to . He ends up killing the wolf , but is no longer seen as a lamb by his former friends , and ca n't return to his previous way of life . The art is beautiful , the songs are .. well , okay , and the voice acting is better than some things today . All in all , you just * have * to see this movie , it is a great masterpiece . Although , it 's very hard to find today .
neg	fulci experiments with sci fi and fails . usually in his non horror films we still get sum great gore , but not here . Sum very funny scenes like when the prisinors are forced to hold onto a bar for 12 minutes and if they drop they are electecuted . the guy falls and and has some kind of fit on the floor for about two minutes until his friends who were struggling to hold on anyway lift him off the floor . The city is an obvious model but not a bad one . and the end explosion is at best laughable . And do nt get me started on the terrible battle scenes . 4/10
pos	No Strings Attached features Carlos Mencia doing stand - up that makes us both laugh and think . Not only does he poke fun at racial issues ( like many haters claim ) , but he also talks about the best way to get illegal immigrants out of the country ... what women mean when they say they want to be treated equally ... why Americans are crazier than Arab terrorists ... why nobody needs to pray for the pope - and what he hopes he 's doing in heaven ... a theory of how Easter ( aka Big Ups to Jesus Day ) traditions got started ... his viewing of the movie Passion of the Christ - and his sub - sequential argument with a woman about whether or not he 's affected by Jesus ... how society should treat the physically handicapped ... and even if you have the right to tell a joke or not . Also , he never stops reminding us that each of us has a voice . So we should use it to speak the truth , say what we think , and not be afraid if others are offended . Carlos is the bomb .
neg	... and how they bore you right out of your mind ! The Crater Lake Monster is one of the classic BAD films from the 70 's made with no actors of any note , an embarrassing script , woeful direction , and a tireless desire to fuse " horror " with light comedy . This movie introduces a paleontologist who finds drawings of an aquatic dinosaur underneath Crater Lake ... a meteor falls from the sky , and an aquatic dinosaur of the claymation variety begins to terrorize and eat the inhabitants surrounding Crater Lake . The whole matter is taken care of by Steve our local sheriff . Much of the film - when not showing pools of blood left behind from what we imagine must have been the beast dining - is spent following the bumbling antic of two guys named Arnie and Mitch who run a boat rental place . They try so bad to be funny , that we get lines like , looking at a business sign , Mitch saying to Arnie " You spelled bait wrong , it 's spelled B - A - T - E. " The laughs were rather scarce here . We then see them get drunk together and imagine a tree trunk to be the dinosaur . Laurel and Hardy watch out ! The dinosaur looks fake , but the movie is fun in a bad way . And at the very least , the lake is beautiful .
pos	Robert Urich was a fine actor , and he makes this TV movie believable . I remember watching this film when I was 15 , and when seeing it a second time my opinion stays the same . People lose who they were when enter this exclusive club , in a computer rich Californian town . Urich try 's to figure out what is wrong with his family , and I love the Halloween space suit idea , brilliant . This film is about the battle of one 's sprit . TV quality , that exceeds , the big budget , Gangs of New York . I wonder if Robert Urich was the compassionate man he portrayed in many of his movie ? I hope so ! 6 or 7 out of 10 .
neg	I was n't really fond of the first " Cube " movie .
