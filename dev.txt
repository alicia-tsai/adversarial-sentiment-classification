pos	Despite reading the " initial comments " from someone who curiously disliked the film -- ( WHY IS THE ONLY NEGATIVE COMMENT VERY FIRST ON THE LIST?)it was very nice to note that virtually everyone else loved it ! Obviously the Church wanted to stress certain points and portray the prophet Joseph Smith in a positive manner ~ that s the whole idea . And in fact , those points were extremely effective . We already know Joseph Smith was human ... but despite that , AND all of the horrific negative attempts stirred on by the adversary , it showed just how he was able to complete a remarkable , God - given work . I 'd recommend it to anyone !
neg	Someone had a great idea : let 's have Misty Mundae do her own , R - rated version of Lara Croft - firing two guns not only in skimpy outfits , but topless as well . It WAS indeed a great idea . The problem is that the people who had it could n't come up with any sort of script or budget to support it . Therefore , we get a " film " that barely reaches medium length by replaying many of its parts ( often in slow - motion ) , and was apparently shot entirely inside a garage . The appeal of Misty Mundae is still evident : she is unbelievably cute and has a natural girl - next - door beauty . However her two female co - stars here , with whom she shares a lengthy lesbian scene , are nowhere near her league . If " Mummy Raider " was presented as a Youtube video , I 'd rate it higher , but as a " film " destined for DVD consumption it can not get more than 1/2 a * out of 4 .
pos	I had the privilege to see this movie at the Intenational Film Festival of Rotterdam . ' Xizhao ' or ' Shower ' is a $ 200.000 lowbudget movie about a father and his 2 sons . The father has a traditional bathhouse somewhere in a traditional Chinese village where local , mostly aged men , come to relax and to go bathing . The father has to sons : a ' retarded ' son who lives with him and a son who lives in a big modern city and who comes to visit him . To this son the traditional village , the bathhouse and his ' retarded ' brother seem strange and annoying , but this changes along the movie . Though the story may sound cheesy or cliche , it 's not . With really great performances , especially of the father and the ' retarded ' son ( sorry , I do n't know their names ) and a great story the movie was touching and funny at the same time . If you got a chance to see this movie do it . It 's a great alternative to mainstream Hollywood cinema .
neg	I hope the viewer who regards ' Dream Machine ' as one of Corey Haim 's finest and the " best movies of the century " was kidding . Undetected sarcasm on my part ? I sincerely hope so . ' The Dream Machine ' marks the first of a long line of mediocre capers that would plague the rest of Corey Haim 's career ( except ' Prayer of the Rollerboys ' which was surprisingly decent ) . Here , Haim plays nonchalant college boy , Bernie , who supposes that a cool car will attract his dream girl 's attention . Lucky for Bernie , a rich woman aiming to get back at her cheating husband , hastily decides to reward her faithful piano tuner -- Bernie -- with a gift : a slick Porsche Turbo . However , unbeknownst to the woman , and unfortunate for Bernie , is that her dead husband was murdered and his body was hidden in the trunk . Now , being that in this movie , bodies do n't seem to decay or possess a rather foul funk , Bernie is unaware of this . In fact , the oblivious boy has no idea that something suspicious is afoot despite several odd circumstances that arise . In particular , a grizzly man follows him around , desperate to get hold of that body relatively undetected . This is a low - grade action fizzle as many of Haim 's films like this are ( see The Double O Kid ) . Despite being part action , part romantic comedy , this movie fails to offer the viewer much of anything of interest for at least the first forty - five minutes in which the filmmakers take more than enough time to show the immediate problem ( i.e. Bernie being in possession of a car and a dead body , and a hit - man finding out that the Porsche is going to be hard to find ) . After which , and thanks to poor acting by Haim ( I loved this kid , too , but it 's not exactly sacrilegious to admit the times when he obviously could n't act well ) and the lack of real immediacy and emergency between Bernie and the villain that makes much of the events unconvincing and as a result , inappreciable . To add injury to insult , the soundtrack was unbelievably laughable and sounded more like self - evident songs you would hear in Team America ( see the ' date ' montage ) . Loyal Corey Haim fans , however , should not be disappointed to see their boy in abundance . However , others understanding that Haim 's career probably peaked when he was 14 or 15 and never recovered , might expect mediocrity , as will viewers just looking for early 90s b - comedy fluff to pass the time .
pos	First things first , I was never once scared of this underrated gem as a kid ( " Little Mermaid " on the other hand ... ) . As my title says this was one of my fav childhood movies that I still love as a teenager . It 's a beautiful , bittersweet movie about a misfit German Shepherd called Charlie ( fantasticaly voiced by Burt Reynolds ) who is killed by his boss / partner in crime ( is name ha , ha is Carface ) . Charlie is sent straight to heaven by default because " all dogs go to heaven because unlike people , dogs are naturally good and loyal and kind " . Chalie gets sent back to Earth 'cause he winded up his life clock where he gets into even more mischief with his best friend , Itchy and a little orphan girl , Anne - Marie . I used to watch this all the time as a kid and I still sometimes watch it . Anyways , it 's a beautiful bittersweet film as I said before that might just leave a tear in your eye ...
neg	Saw this ' film ' recently and have to say it was the worst attempt at film making I have ever had the misfortune to see . What the Hell was going on with Coolio ? Totally unprovoked shooting at people in distress . Totally uninvolving , slow , tedious and detached . Worse than Spawn . long live " Evil dead II " .
pos	At first I was weirded out that a TV show 's main character could bring the dead back to life , but then I thought I 'd give it a shot . Guess what ? I love " Pushing Daisies " and look forward to Wednesday nights just to watch it , then for the next week I watch it a few more times on my DVR . The colorful characters , witty banter , fast - paced dialogue , and new unique situations draws me in and captivates from beginning to end . Ned and Chuck Charles ' relationship is interesting to watch as they work their romance around the fact that they can not have physical contact . Even Detective Emerson Cod 's character has continued to grow in complexity . And Olive Snook ! Jiminy Crispies ! She cracks me up ! The narrator 's voice is fun to listen to and the cinematography gives me the impression that I am watching a movie instead of a TV show . I have recommended my family and friends to turn on " Pushing Daisies " and they are hooked too ! ! ! The show is well worth waiting a week for a new episode and if you have not seen " P.D. " , I highly recommend watching it !
neg	I figured the whole joke of the movie would be to see some rich white guy acting like Chris Rock , and then see Chris Rock react to people 's reactions . Instead you just see Chris Rock being himself and people not understanding him . There are maybe 2 scenes in the entire movie where they use their gimmick . This should have been a lot better .
pos	Jackie Chan is considered by many film and martial arts movie fans as one of the greatest action stars ever to grace the silver screen and Police Story cemented his reputation as the likely successor to the late , great Bruce Lee . If Enter The Dragon bared the so - called bench mark of Lee 's greatness in the 70s , then the same can be said about Police Story and Jackie Chan in the 80s . Forget about the Rush Hour trilogy , or any of his US efforts- the one film that really typifies Chan 's excellence , not to mention kick starting his status as a high kicking , bone - crushing kung- fu talisman , as well as his movie career was this , Police Story- the first in a series of successful cop films , set in mainland , present day Hong Kong . I 've seen many of his efforts- likewise the US - based Rush Hour , Rumble in the Bronx , The Medalian and The Tuxedo to name- and frankly many of them pale into insignificance compared to Police Story . In those movies , we saw a less ' dumbed down ' version of Jackie , of whom did n't get the opportunity to utilise his fighting abilities to the maximum , not to mention the fight sequences were no where as good as those in such efforts as Drunken Master , Police Story to name .   The stunts in this movie are extraordinary and are the best featured in any action movie . The shopping mall scene is literally one of a kind and has to be seen to be believed : the flying shards of glass , Chan who is left dangling outside the bus only by his walking stick as a madman frantically drives through the streets of the town , and Chan successfully making usage of all sorts of inanimate objects and prop devices as weapons to fight the bad guys with .   Considering he is known for injuring and breaking every bone in his body and putting himself in harm 's way , Jackie 's persistence in showing his versatility as a stuntman himself by not relying on one , is somewhat of a testament to his reputation as a kung fu expert . Especially as he has the bruises to show for it . Thus , he has proved that he is no one - trick pony when it comes down to devising and coming up with various and clever looking moves . Story - wise , there is not much to discuss but what it lacks in narrative , it makes up with its end - to end action and fight sequences . As for the dialogue , well it 's not a really huge aspect of the film- which is why most fans of Jackie 's and martial arts films are more interested in action , as opposed to the story . Unlike say The Matrix , there are no wires or CGI , or any form of computer trickery involved . What you see is what you get- and what you get with Police Story is a great Jackie Chan epic , full of action and pulsating stunts . It is miles better than Rumble In The Bronx , Rush Hour and all his other American efforts . Police Story is an excellent film and one I 'd definitely recommend to anyone who is a novice Jackie Chan fan , but of whom are unsure which one they should watch first .
neg	Acting was weak , but in a horror flick , I can live with that if the story is good . It was n't . The initial event was an clumsy and obvious ploy to exploit most people 's adoration of kids . OK , fine . Fast forward to the " place in the country " where they will recover emotionally . I like the revelation of the ghosts . OK , cool -- this will be a supernatural kinda horror story , with rotting things partly in our world partly in ... where ever . Then the action starts pulling like a three headed dog in a flurry of cats and birds -- Is there an evil force trying to attack them directly ? Is there an evil force trying to attack them INdirectly -- make people do awful things they would n't really do ? Oh , wait , no , maybe the whole REGION is some kind of psychic echo chamber where ambient discord can reverberate into murder ? OK , hold on -- maybe it 's really just one little mentally tangled " Delbert "- style redneck boy who misses his Mommy and is on some kind of spree like a K - Tel Norman Bates knock off ? Oh , yeah -- extra points off : the only Black character seems to be the grandson of an " Our Gang " pullman porter . The actor plays it as straight as he can given the crummy dialogue , but the fact is , his purpose is " Y'all done betta get outa heah , Boss ! " At least they wrote him smart enough to GTF outta there . The bit with the little girl being silenced and pulled away was definitely creepy , as was the chick in the shower . Those were just two of quite a few really delicious tidbits in this movie . The problem is that they are combined in disharmonious ways , like a bite of steak , a bite of chocolate and a bite of a Gummi bear . Each is great on it 's own , but mixed up ? Bleah ! Such potential . Wasted .
pos	A lush fantasy world with quirky characters and annoying 80 's music . This epitomizes the 80 's desire to rewrite fairy tales and make fun of how they work . Personally I liked Greensleeves and the other harsher characters . They had some of the more amusing lines .
neg	no redeeming qualities can possibly be expressed . i wish i could get my time back . nice skull face broad really smiles , bright at the camera when the disease has already wreaked enough havoc on the ill informed script . i was ( ( spoiler ) ) happy to see all the characters dead or severely incapacitated by the end , especially the party poopers that drink the tainted juice on their way to the alleged sunset . Eli Roth does shine for moments of maybe ten , putting forth the theory on how well weed smokes in the woods when others really fiend on top of beer consumption . overall , i found most of it pointless , though not without gratuitous violence and not enough nudity , happy to witness the demise of cast , in a way though , wishing that journey never happened ( probably should 've been getting laid instead of watching TBS late night , ugh ) .
pos	Overall I was rather impressed with the pilot . The initial first fifteen minutes were worrying , as it did feel the creators were trying to create a science fiction version of The O.C but this fear is rectified when a terrorist incident occurs and from here the show steps into themes and situations that I very rarely see television tackle . BSG dealt with themes such as monotheism , existentialism , reality , death and terrorism but they were primarily subtext , there for the viewer to contemplate on or ignore if they so choose . Here on the other hand these subjects are the focus of the show and I personally found myself evoking such works as Ghost In The Shell and The Matrix as reference points while watching and being surprised by how well the themes were being discussed . I think if you are a fan of the two I just mentioned or other films / television shows , which deal with the subjects I referenced , I think you will find at least something here . In terms of a starting point to explain how the situation we know in BSG came about I believe they handled it in a very interesting way , I especially liked how they explained where the Cylon 's belief in one God came from and the creation of Caprica had just enough advanced and contemporary technology thrown in to make it appear in the future but not completely alien to us as viewers . The only real weak points I noticed were the relationship between the Greystone parents and the actress who plays ' Lacy Rand ' . While I like Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson individually , together their scenes seemed to lack chemistry , at this point it could simply be down to developing their characters , but this is something I think needs work . I also found Magda Apanowicz to be unconvincing in her role . This again could be down to experience and time needed to develop , but throughout the episode her acting appeared forced and not completely confident . Based on the pilot I greatly look forward to seeing where ' Caprica ' goes in the future and hopefully it will touch the greatness that BSG once did .
neg	This series is one of the worst shows I have ever seen . Terrible acting , terrible effects , terrible writing , you get my drift . The stories are so far from the legend of Robin Hood it 's amazing . Looks like they just wanted to use the name Robin Hood to attract an audience . It might as well have been called New Adventures of Mr. Bland Acting . Someone commented before me that if you had imagination , you 'd love this show . That is a horrible approach to a TV - series . A visual media like this should spark your imagination , you should n't have to force your imagination into something to make it good . That would be like the Simpsons episode where they try to brainwash Homer with a religious propaganda movie , and he starts talking about who killed who or whatever . " If a movie is boring , I just make up my own story . " In conclusion : Absolute human waste .
pos	As an adult I really did enjoy this one . I watched it with my 2 granddaughters and the 3 1/2 year old was fascinated and the 15 month old giggled at the mice . The music is fun and the animation is wonderful . This sequel does what Return to Neverland did n't accomplish . A good follow - up to the Cinderella story ; but what becomes of Drusilla ? Another sequel ? I hope so !
neg	3lbs is obviously just a self indulgent programme for Stanley Tucci to be a producer / moody deep doctor . Unlike House he has absolutely no personality and unlike Grey 's Anatomy the brain surgery cases are't even interesting . This programme is supposed to be set in a leading centre for Neurlogical cases - yet there 's nothing interesting or exciting going on ! Not even the so called pathetic ' feud ' between him and a rival adds anything to the show and neither do those hallucinations . In the pilot there was a brief glimpse into the leads 's social life as a father - snooze ! boring and pointless . This show is pants , there 's a glut of medical dramas around at the moment and this does nothing to make it stand out as special .
pos	I can tell you just how bad this movie is . I was in the movie and I have n't seen it yet , but I cringe at the thought of anyone actually paying to see me drunk . Especially considering what we did that year . The thing is that they probably over edited it . Especially the scene where my roommate was snorting coke of the tits of a Mexican prostitute ( they probably should have followed him around ) . We made a few come and go appearances but aside from that I ca n't really remember anything . I was the MC in a few scenes ( from what I 'm told . What I can tell you is that everyone avoided the camera crew since who wants to be remembered as the guy who threw up or the girl who showed her tits to the world ( or the girl that loser lost his virginity to ) . Overall the trip itself was crazy but people act different once the camera is on them .
neg	At first glance this documentary / fiction / cartoon is quite entertaining and thought provoking . Of course , when something provokes thought , it can then be scrutinized . The reality is this movie combines metaphysics with innuendo and baseless conclusions . The link that " What the Bleep ... " would have you see between science and spirituality is , in fact , not rooted in science at all . The Transcendental Meditation study mentioned in the film claims that meditation by a group can reduce crime in a given area , Washington D.C. in this case . In reality the HRA ( Homicides , Rapes , and Assaults ) crime rate was about 30 % higher in 1993 than the average crime rate between 19881992 . There was absolutely no decrease in the homicide rate during the study . In fact , each and every claim that links metaphysics to science can and has been debunked . My conclusion from this information is that this movie is either a poor attempt to indoctrinate people or a joke . Either way , I suggest that you do not waste your time . If you are looking for a long winded movie about science that could provoke thoughts , you might consider Mindwalk ( 1990 ) .
pos	I guess if a film has magic , I do n't need it to be fluid or seamless . It can skip background information , go too fast in some places , too slow in others , etc . Magic in this film : the scene in the library . There are many minor flaws in Stanley & Iris , yet they do n't detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible , the hardest to fix . Both characters are smart . Yet Stanley ca n't understand enough to function because he ca n't read ; he ca n't read because he 's had too much adventure in his childhood . Iris , although well - educated , has n't had enough adventure and so ca n't understand how to move past the U - turn her life took . In both their faults and strengths , the characters compliment each other . It may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an Iris would wind up working year after year in a factory , or that a Stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better - paying job . And while these " mysteries " are explained in the course of the story , their unfolding seems somewhat contrived . I assume no one took the time to rethink the script . Even so , it 's a good moviejust imagine what De Niro , Fonda and Plimpton would have done on screen if someone had !
neg	Despite some occasionally original touches , like the " virtual sets " that provide the background for the Victorian interiors featuring Ada Lovelace and her circle , this film falls short and ultimately disappoints . Newcomer Francesca Faridany seems talented , but is wasted as Emmy , a character who by mid - film is reduced to nothing more than staring at a monitor watching Lady Ada narrate an autobiography . ' Conceiving Ada ' takes off briefly when Lady Ada ( Tilda Swinton ) appears ; the camera lingers on her facial expressions , mannerisms , even making her appear to be translucent or momentarily invisible , apporting into scenes to dramatize Emmy 's " virtual " rendering of her . A straightforward biopic of Ada Lovelace would have been worthwhile , but this film unfortunately makes a hash of both Lady Ada 's life , and that of a modern - day computer scientist ( and her broadly - drawn , doltish boyfriend ) .
pos	I was so impressed with Doug McGrath 's film version of the Jane Austen novel " Emma , " and I loved the music score by Rachel Portman so much , that when I went to the video store one day and discovered the two had re - united for " Nicholas Nickleby " I immediately rented it without any other consideration . I have read the book , and for those overly - critical fans of this Jane Austen adaptation , I do n't know what else McGrath could have done to more perfectly capture the spirit and major plot elements of Miss Austen 's work , especially given the limitations of a two hour movie ( which some have complained about being too long ! ) . And as far as Gwen Paltrow 's accent is concerned , I must confess I was n't too familiar with her when I saw this at the theater initially , and I was absolutely convinced at the time that she was an English actress ! I am taken aback by those who criticized the film for its lush scenery . That is one of the things I enjoy and look forward to seeing in period pieces set in the English countryside . The film 's beautiful backgrounds are a major contributor to its appeal and success . If your idea of escapist fare is something bleaker , then perhaps you should rent something like " Death Wish III ! " The English country settings are as attractive and charming as the cast , and combine with the story and soundtrack for entertainment that makes you not tire of repeat viewings . McGrath is a wonder at choreographing the interplay of subtle expressions that are so essential in conveying the complicated romantic intrigue that occurs in this story . This refreshing movie could also be a clinic on how enjoyable a film can be minus sex , violence or even a villainous antagonist . The story is often amusing , endearing , and at times , quite touching . I have seen many competent Jane Austen book adaptations but this is without question my favorite .
neg	I was surprised when I saw this film . I 'd heard it was the best ever filmed of the novel . How disappointed I was . How any true Jane Austen fan can rate this adaptation is a mystery to my eyes . The scriptwriters have decided to stick in bits of ridiculous humour which are embarrassing at the best of times , but also ruin the feel of the period . As for the cast : Gwyneth Paltrow makes a rather shallow heroine ( but then any ' hot ' American star would be questionable in the role ) , Toni Collette is miscast , and poor Ewan McGregor is made to look laughable ! I really could not say a good thing about this film . I seem to be among the very few who do n't rate it , but if you want my advice , see instead the TV production starring Kate Beckinsale - believe me , that is far preferable to this superficial trash .
pos	The superb star quality of Gerard Philipe , who died way too young , leaps from the screen in this witty , funny , sly swashbuckling comedy with plenty of sword fencing and knockabout antics . Charmingly loopy in its ' storytelling , impossible to resist . A sweet romantic comedy with a very young Gina Lollobrigida as the love interest . A movie one will remember with great affection .
neg	I was skimming over the list of films of Richard Burton when I came to this title that I recall vividly from when I first saw it on cable in 1982 . I remember dialogue from Tatum O'Neal that was just amazingly bad . I remember Richard Burton 's character looking so hopelessly lost , and then remembering how his motivations did n't translate to me . In short , I remember " Circle of Two " because it was so phenomenally awful . This movie came out at a time when America was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed angles on teenage sexuality . Recall " The Blue Lagoon " ( and other Brooke Shields annoyances ) , " Lipstick " , " Little Darlings " , " Beau Pere " and other films that just seemed to dwell on teens having sex , particularly with adults . As a teenager during this time , I found the obsession , combined with the sexual excesses of the 70 's and 80 's , made for a subconsciously unsettling environment in which to figure it all out , so to speak . " Circle of Two " is not execrably acted or needlessly prurient , like " Blue Lagoon " . In fact , it tackles the question of love between the young and the old in a brave , if totally failed , way . But honestly , it is one of those films you will * never * see if you did n't see it on its first run because it was so truly awful . No one would want to have this garbage ever surface to be publicly distributed again .
pos	The Sentinel is a movie that was recommended to me years ago , by my father , and i 've seen it many times since . It always manages to entertain me , while being effectively creepy as well . The flashback scenes are what really made it for me . Cristina Raines 's father running around all creepily , with the two creepy woman , always manages to send chills down my spine . it 's your typical good vs evil thing , but at least it manages to be entertaining . The ending I consider to be one of the finest in Horror history . It has plenty of shocks and suspense , seeing Burgess Meredith do his thing as Chazen , had me on the edge of my seat . The Sentinel has the perfect build up of tension . We are never fully comfortable whenever Allison is on screen . We know something terrible is always awaiting her , and that made things all the more tense . This movie is often neglected among horror fans , but I personally think it 's one of the better one 's out there , and it certainly has enough for all Horror fans , to be satisfied . Performances . Cristina Raines has her wooden moments , but came though in a big way for the most part . She 's beautiful to look at , and her chemistry with Saranadon felt natural . Chris Sarandon is great as the boyfriend , Michael . He had an instant screen presence , and I could n't help but love him . Martin Balsam , José Ferrer , John Carradine , Ava Gardner , Arthur Kennedy , Sylvia Miles , Deborah Raffin , Jerry Orbach , Richard Dreyfuss , Jeff Goldblum and Tom Berenger all have memorable roles , or small cameos . Burgess Meredith is terrific as Chazen . He looks like a normal old man , but what we find out , is absolutely terrifying . Eli Wallach&Christopher Wlaken do well , as the bumbling detectives . Beverly D'Angelo has one chilling scene , that I wo n't spoil . Bottom line . The Sentinel is an effective Horror film that Horror fans , sadly tend to neglect . It will give you the thrills and scares you need to be satisfied . Well worth the look . 7/10
neg	David Chase 's " The Sopranos " is perhaps the most over - praised television show in recent memory . Not only is the series devoid of intellect and passion , it 's devoid of a soul . As anyone reading likely knows already , James Gandolfini * IS * Tony Soprano , a big , fat a**hole of a mob boss with a spoiled b*tch of a wife , and two bratty , sh*t - brained kids living in - you guessed it - the armpit of America ( that 's New Jersey , by the way ) . Not only is Tony a womanizing adulterer , he 's also an unrepentant murdering scumbag , with a crew of " Saturday Night Live " skit - worthy caricatures for subordinates . It 's not the fact that Tony is a piece of sh*t mobster that offends me ( and apparently only me ) . Allowing characters to be who and what they are , without judgment , is something American TV hardly allows . But Chase - and his entourage of money - gorged , Emmy - gored writers - have not simply allowed us to observe Tony and his crew as they behave , nor have they even attempted to provide any insight into the action / reaction reality of ( even obviously fictionalized ) organized crime ( a la " The Godfather " ) . Instead , Chase glorifies and endorses his characters ' greedy , violent , and corrupt lifestyle in the same way that Tony , his wife , and even his hair - brained psychologist do week after week ( or should I say month after month . Or is it year after year ? It seems like the show 's paltry 13-episode seasons come out with the same regularity as a lunar eclipse ) . Much has been made of the series ' refusal to adhere to " network " structure , with plot lines that go nowhere , and characters that pop - up and disappear like backyard vermin . But if the show is so brilliant in its lack of structure , why does it always feel like I 'm watching a soap - opera ? Tired mob clichés , bored housewives , self - serving , irredeemable characters AND plots that go nowhere . More than ever , I can see why so many Americans of Italian heritage are p*ssed at this show . It 's enough to make you want to curl up with a good book ( Danté 's " Inferno " springs to mind ) . People on IMDb love to claim that there 's nothing good on television , and therefore " The Sopranos " is a breath of fresh air . Are these same people too busy paying their cable bills to watch " The Shield " ? ( It 's included in Basic , ya know ) . How about the ( still good ) " The West Wing " ? Or the brilliantly acted ( if erratically written ) " Boston Legal " ? What about possibly the best comedy of the last few decades , " Arrested Development " ? And lest we forget that we live in an age of DVDs - nobody * has * to watch * anything * new . I 'd much rather shell out $ 40 for an over - priced boxed set of , well , pretty much * anything * , than give HBO $ 10 a month ( or $ 80 a DVD set ! ) to continue to prove how much of a hack - factory it can be . You want good television ? Watch " Homicide : Life on the Street . " Or " Murder One " . Or " Picket Fences " . Or even Chase 's prior show , " Northern Exposure . " If you 're already among " The Sopranos " 's legion of brain - washed fans and critics , it 's too late for you . But if not , leave Tony and his worthless kin where they all belong - rotting with the fishes . ( " Sleeping " would be way too kind )
pos	I saw this film at the Taos Film Festival last year , and was just overwhelmed by it . It 's a rich , warm novel brought to the screen , beautifully acted , and well directed . More than anything , it reminded me of the films of David Lean , both in its ability to handle a complex story , and its knack for creating powerful scenes that affect you on several different levels . The best movie I 've seen in years .
neg	George Brent is a reporter sent to interview an heiress . She is supposedly the heir to a face cream fortune . He interviews her on her yacht . They fall for each other in bathing costumes . It turns out ( quite early ) that she is not an heiress . She part of an advertising campaign for the cold cream . The movie follows the ups and downs of their romance . The supporting cast does little to buoy it up . Davis and Brent carry the picture . Though it 's fairly predictable , it is also fairly entertaining . It 's far from her best . But , especially considering its obscurity in her oeuvre , it 's not one of her worst , either .
pos	Principally it is the story of two men who were part of the Portuguese revolution . It was easy to understand the contest , but usually directors starts from a historical fact to speak about something else , or they shows also the period before or after this fact , here everything happen during that couple of days when the revolution acts . It could also be seen as a kind of documentary . The movie focalize to these two people , showing as normal they were , not like common heroes , because the revolution come from people . Although it was made from military army from the title you can understand that they were just " capitaes " as the main characters . Nice colors and lights during the whole movie , excellent work for the director being her first movie , she does n't fall to the banal way . Well shown emotions and passion of people and crowd . The character of Maia ( main one)is well - made and there is also a good interpretation for Stefano Accorsi , able to show Maia 's limits , this not - being an hero .
neg	Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer do not provide the right chemistry here in this 1945 film . There is a good story here about the Axis trying to obtain coal to use for the upcoming war . Unfortunately , this part of the story is not emphasized . Instead , we deal with a supposedly bungling Boyer . By the way , Bacall is as British as Vladimir Putin . The real acting kudos goes to veteran Oscar winner Katina Paxinou . As was the case with her memorable Pilar in the 1943 Oscar winner , " For Whom the Bell Tolls , " Paxinou again plays a Spanish revolutionary but this time she is a double - crossing counter - spy for the pro - Franco group . She is quite a vicious character here;especially , when she throws a 14 year old child out the window . She believed that Boyer had given the child important material to hide .
pos	I had lost faith in Sooraj R. Barjatya after the movie Main Prem Ki Deewani hoon , then a year back now I saw promos for Vivah which looked good . But I did n't want to waste my hard earned money watching it in cinema . When the film first came out on DVD I rented it and watched and I loved the movie and took back my words for Sooraj . I just finished watching it yesterday again and this time I thought I have to review this movie . Sooraj R. BarjatyaGot it right this time , okay I was not a huge fan of Hum App Ke Hai Kaun . But I have always loved Manie Pyar kiya , after Manie Pyar kiya to me I think Vivah is Barjatyas best work . I hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying . If you have ever been in love before then there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie , the movie is just too sweet and will have you falling in love with it , my view a much underrated movie . The story of this movie you might call desi and very old times , but to me it seemed modern because the two couples which are getting an arrange marriage are aware it 's an old tradition . It 's done in present times , lots of people do n't believe in this arrange marriage , but I do . The journey between the engagement and wedding which will always be special and this movie shows it clearly . When Prem meets Poonam for the first time , they show it how it is and that 's reality and my parents where saying that 's how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way Prem and Poonam meet in this movie is how most marriages happen . It was a very sweet , you feel nervous yet excited , the song " Do Ajnabe " shows that very well . Getting back to the story yes it 's a journey which you soon get glued to between Prem and Poonam ( Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao ) and there families . A twist occurs in this movie which is really good , the last 30mins you all will be reaching for the tissue box . What makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between Prem and Poonam , how they fall for each other is too sweet . Simple boy and Simple Girl , when they first meet during and after the song " Do Anjane Ajnabe " It 's very sweet to watch , She hardly says anything and Prem does all the talking being honest with her about his past and the girl he liked and him smoking . Then it leads on to them all having a family trip and then that 's when they really do fall for each other . It makes you just want to watch the couple and watch all the sweet moments they have . Another factor is that Poonam chichi is really mean to her and you feel sorry for Poonam because she has been treated bad and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness , you too start feeling happy with her the movie basically makes you fall in love with Poonam more then just Prem . When she finds happiness through Prem you want her to stay happy and also hope nothing goes wrong because the character is shown as a sweet simple girl . Which brings me to performances and Amrita Roa as Poonam is amazing in the movie , her best work till date you will fall in love with this innocent character and root her on to find happiness . Shahid Kapoor as Prem is amazing too , he is Poonam support in the film , he is her happiness the movie , together they share an amazing chemistry and I have never seen a cuter couple since SRK and Kajol . If Ishq Vishk did n't touch you to telling you how cute they are together this surely will . " Mujhe Haq hai " the song and before that is amazing chemistry they show . Scenes which touched me was when Prem takes Poonam to his room and shows her that 's where they will be staying and he opens her up and they have a moment between them which is too sweet . Again if you have ever been in love with someone that much these scenes you can defiantly connect to . The film is just the sweetest thing you will see ever . The direction is spot on , to me a good movie is basically something that can pull me in and stop me believe for this hours what is being seen here is fake and there is a camera filing them . To me this film pulled me in and for those three hours I felt really connected to the movie . The songs you will only truly like when you have seen the movie as they are songs placed in the situation after I saw the movie I been playing the songs non stop ! The music is amazing , the story is simply amazing too what more can I ask for ? What I can finally say it , rarely do we get a movie that makes us feel good , this movie after you have seen it will make you feel really good and make you want to be a better person . Its basically the sweetest journey ever , its basically showing you they journey between engagement and marriage and many people say it 's the bestest part of your life  Well this movie actually shows you way do people actually say that ? Why do people actually say that the journey is just that amazing ! Watch this movie and you will find out why the journey is amazing !
neg	This is the worst documentary to come out of Canada ever ! ! ! ! I 'm glad to see the guys have n't made another movie . All they want to do is get a movie made and it does n't have to be the one they wrote . They keep changing the script to suite the person they 're pitching . I could not get out of the theatre fast enough when I saw it at that year 's Toronto Film Festival . Please never see this film .
pos	The name of this film alone made me want to see just what it was all about , so I taped this film during the early hours of the AM . If you ever wanted to see what miners had to go through during the early days and actually see a dramatic scene when the mine crumbles in on the men . This film clearly wants to show that Germany and France can work together and be friends after WW I and how the Germans came to the aid of the French miners much to the unbelief of the French townsfolk . The actors were all outstanding , with unusual scenes in the mine with a horse and a small young boy who worked in the mine . There is an old old retired miner who manges to go down the mine by ladder when the elevator breaks down . If you are a real film buff , this is a film you will not want to miss .
neg	You may consider a couple of facts in the discussion to be spoilers . I 'm sorry , but Spielberg did n't deserve to win any Oscar for this piece , and I think the Academy was right in that vote . ( Other Oscars for best actor nominations and such ... that I do n't know about . But it would be hard to justify , given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product . ) The way Spielberg directs this is so contrived , so meddlesome . While watching this movie a distinction made during a Film as Art course I have taken was screaming at me : " Sentiment is honest emotion honestly rendered . Sentimentality is sugary and unreal , a false view of life . " This is over - the - top sentimentality . When in real life to two people ever begin to read out loud in synchronicity , as Celie and Shug Avery do when sitting on the bed going over the letters from Nettie they have found ? There are examples of this type of faux behavior throughout the film : all the men crowding around Miss Millie 's car and then jumping in unison like a flock of birds taking off when she goes to drive away ; Harpo falling through the roofs of various buildings he 's working on ( a cheap slapstick gag ) ; the whole troop of revelers heading from the Jook Joint en masse to the chapel , as if magically entranced by the choir 's singing ... on and on . Nothing rings true . I even wondered if Harpo 's name was chosen purposefully because it 's his wife Sophia 's real name , " Oprah , " backwards . Spielberg is n't above such " cuteness . " It 's not that Spielberg is incapable of honestly rendered action and emotion . Schindler 's List was amazing , deeply touching for me , and I greatly admire Saving Private Ryan too for its realism , even if the story is a bit contrived .
pos	" Så som in himmelen " was probably one of the 3 most beautiful films I have seen in my life . That it did not win the Oscar , I will not shed a tear . This movie is in a kind of class of its own , that an Oscar win would possibly have detracted from it ! ! ! My dearest friend Anders ( Nyberg ) , you have done true magnificence with your pen here ! Kay Pollak , with your creation , and everyone contributing , you all have given a gift of Love to our world . Between the points of entering this world of ours , then exiting it - you really can say that you made it better ! A special personal thank you from my soul to all of you , that you brought back some precious memories from the second decade of my life . I grew up in Sweden , and my young mind and present Beingness was formed and shaped by many beautiful Swedish influences , individuals , traditions , music and nature . My blessings with gratitude to you all . With Love and Light , George - Gabriel Berkovits Soulhealer , Johannesburg , South Africa
neg	I guess this movie is a fitting tribute to the first Superman film , as it is just as crummy and painfully long as the original . After an opening scene consisting solely of murky intergalactic visuals , the credits pay homage to the even - crummy - looking - for - their - time futuristic sweeping credits of the original Superman film . Then there is some more murky stuff . Ma Kent sees some kind of murky ruckus on the farm , and spends a good portion of my life slowly walking up to some debris in the cornfield . Then Superman sneaks up on her and faints . Next we catch up with Lex Luthor in a scene about many murky close - ups of an old lady as she dies . We do n't see Luthor 's face until the end of the scene , an early instance of the film 's drive to leave no hackneyed stone unturned . Lex Luthor is a guy who does n't like Superman because he is not human . Also , he probably does n't like humans either , as the movie occasionally features some kind of plot about Lex Luthor planning to kill most of Earth 's population . After a while , Clark Kent shows up back at his old job ( I forgot to mention , he had been away on a five year trip where nothing happened ) . Then he finds out Lois Lane has an illegitimate kid and is dating Cyclops . It upsets him so much that he loses control of his super strength to such an extent that he accidentally breaks a picture frame . At this point we see that Miss Lane is on some kind of jet attached to some kind of space shuttle . It is some kind of important event on account of it is on television . Then we learn that there are people in a control room monitoring this event . There are also people watching it on television and there are pilots in the cockpit . The film then reminds us that these people are involved by cutting between them for most of the summer . As the events leading up to the inevitable disaster started to build , I excused myself to get a soda . I accidentally walked back into the wrong theater and watched that movie about Al Gore showing slides in its entirety . I tried to find my way back to Superman Returns , but I somehow wandered into Prairie Home Companion , which I watched twice in a row . Then it was time to stop messing around . I walked back into the first theater , found my seat , and looked up to see that the impending Lois Lane space shuttle disaster was almost upon us . Still , it seemed to be taking forever , so I wandered around the theater , met a girl , got married , raised a son and sent him off to college . While attending my son 's medical school graduation , I remembered that I should probably check in on Superman Returns , so I excused myself and raced back to the theater only to learn there was no need to hurry . It still took about another half hour before things went wrong for Space Shuttle Lane . When they did , Superman saved everybody , which was pretty cool . . And then there is a a subplot where Superman turns really creepy and starts stalking Lois Lane and her family with his x - ray vision and super - hearing . Then he tries to get her to cheat on Cyclops , who seems like a good guy . Meanwhile , Lex Luthor is involved in some kind of contest to display every possible generic villain behavior before the end of the movie . I forgot to bring my scorecard home with me ( they give you one at the door ) , but I think he scored damn close to one hundred percent . I hope he wins the million dollars . At this point , things start to gear up for the big murky finale . I think maybe the projector was broken , on account of the movie seemed to be in some kind of loop for a while here . I remember seeing murky things growing out of the water , Superman getting sick , Superman getting better , back to the murky things , he 's sick again , no wait , he 's okay again . Then Lex Luthor unleashed his final bad guy move : yelling at his girlfriend a little bit . Then Superman died and came back to life . I thought the movie was over , so I left . Ninety years later , the nursing home where I lived felt a little chilly . I realized I left my sweatshirt back in the theater , and I went to retrieve it . When I did , I was slightly surprised to find that Superman Returns was n't over yet . I tried to ask some of the viewers what I missed , but most of them were only skeletons with long gray beards by now . I sat back in my old seat and watched as Lois Lane puttered around her house for a while . Then Superman showed up and started quoting the beginning of the movie , and since I already saw that part I thought it was okay to leave . So that is my review of Superman Returns . Oh , also , if you like jokes about people eating dogs or jokes about one dog eating another dog , you will love this movie . On account of there are two jokes like that in it .
pos	IQ is a wonderfully original romantic comedy that pits the greatest and deepest - thinking scientific minds of the 20th century as Cupid 's helpers . The juxtaposition of heart and mind is the central theme of this light - hearted yet thoughtful movie . You do n't quite know how to react because part of the time you are seeing great scientists do silly things to nurture budding love , but at other times , you hear them discuss some of the deepest puzzles of space / time of our age . The end result is a fun movie with surprises throughout . Walter Matthau is a perfect Einstein , Meg Ryan creates a quirky , scatter - brained mathematician , and Tim Robbins brings to life the contradictions of a poorly educated working man who is fascinated by science . All together , they create a farcical trip through love and science , mind and heart .
neg	Amelia and Michael are a married couple that are cheating on each other . Amelia has a long - time lover in the hospital and Michael hires a prostitute that does n't satisfy him . The two smolder with their infidelity but manage to connect to each other in the end . There 's not a whole lot to this particular short . The direction is straight - forward and dramatic , which is good , the acting is sincere , but the story leaves a little bit to be desired . Why , exactly , do we care about these two people ? It 's a little hard to see how this story sticks out from any other infidelity story except that it 's much more pared down and does n't search for meaning in it ( a welcoming change of pace if anything ) . I do n't know , it 's possible I do n't connect to these stories because I 've never experienced them . But I have noticed that the blocking in these narratives are typically the same , i.e. , a couple talking together while avoiding eye - contact by pretending to be immersed in magazines , etc . The nice things about short films is that they provide a bit more room for trying something different , and I 'd like to see a different take . --PolarisDiB
pos	This movie is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving acting alone , but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation . Women and performers ( both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star ) are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in China . This makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culture . The only problem I had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors ' performance . A welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies .
neg	Greenaway seems to have a habit of trying deliberately to disgust his viewers . This film opens with incest -- and purposeless , meaningless , casual incest at that . That 's Greenaway 's big problem . He prefers parlor tricks to shock over actually doing anything meaningful . Technical skill is n't enough . He 's just a bit perverse for the sake of perversity .
pos	I got to say that Uma Thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet . this movie was uber cute and I mean uber cute . It had all the " sex " content that most Ivan Reitman comedies have but with something a lil extra , CHEMISTRY . Uma and Luke both have this awkrawrd but believable chemistry that seem to transcend in each scene . Both seem to create this odd , twisted and interesting relationship with powerful " sexual " tension that you laugh until you ca n't feel your face anymore . Anna Farris and the rest of the supporting cast seem to play off each other 's roles perfectly and even Wanda Sykes ' rather small role will keep you laughing . Though these kind of comedies are n't for everybody , but I have to say I went with a person that does n't usually enjoy these films and he was laughing like crazy . This movie is certainly not for everyone . especially younger children since some moments are little too ... well lets say ADULT for younger viewers . All in all I was pleasantly surprised by this movie , tough the ending I found was a little weak compared to the rest of the film . ( 3 1/2 * out of 5 * )
neg	I do n't hand out " ones " often , but if there was ever a film that deserved this sort of attention , it 's " Gas ! " This is self - indulgent crap that reaches for some of the ambiance of M*A*S*H and falls completely flat on its face in the attempt . I see what Corman was going for - Malcolm Marmorstein and Elliott Gould tried to reproduce Gould 's deathless role in the original movie version of M*A*S*H with a similar plot ( in the movie " Whiffs " - look it up here in IMDb , http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073891/ for more information ) . Marmorstein and Gould got closer to the brass ring with " Whiffs " than Corman did with " Gas ! " but did n't quite get there . Neither one of those films even got close to the success of M*A*S*H. What 's wrong with " Gas ! " ? What is n't ? No one comes close to really acting at a level above junior high school theatrics . The production values stink . Someone else here mentioned the magically regenerating headlights on a getaway car , and there 's more of that lack of attention to detail . Nothing works the way it 's supposed to in this film , and nobody cares . " Gas ! " actually put me to sleep . It 's not a sure cure for insomnia , but really close . On the Cinematic Sleep Induction scale , " Gas ! " falls somewhere between " Last Year at Marienbad " and George Clooney 's remake of " Solaris " ( which itself was remarkable for being more boring than the Mosfilm original , despite that studio 's seeming unfamiliarity with the idea of keeping the audience 's attention by judicious editing ) . Judicious editing would have decimated " Gas ! " to about twenty minutes . The result would be pointless , but no more so than the original film . Certain films are so bad that they have a compelling quality that makes them worth watching anyway . This is n't one of them . Do n't waste your time . It 's not even amusingly bad .
pos	In the film " Brokedown Palace , " directed by Jonathan Kaplan , two best friends , Alice ( Claire Danes ) and Darlene ( Kate Beckinsale ) decide to celebrate high school graduation by taking a trip to Hawaii , but hear that Bangkok , Thailand , is much more fun . They switched plans and decided to go to Thailand without telling their parents the change of plans . While they were in Thailand , Alice and Darlene met a really handsome guy named Nick Parks ( Daniel Lapaine ) . He tells them that he would trade in his first class ticket to Hong Kong for three economy tickets so that they could spend the weekend in Hong Kong . They accepted his offer and upon entering the airport the two were arrested for smuggling drugs . They were convicted and sentenced to thirty three years in prison .   I think Kaplan was trying to show the audience that it is wise to make good decisions because in one instance one bad decision can change the direction of a life forever . Also , a friendly face may not be as friendly as we think once we find out the real intentions of that friendly face . Those girls made a decision not to tell their parents that they had switched their plans and it changed their lives forever . Things have a funny way of happening showing us what decision we have made verses the decision that we should have made . Sometimes life is not fair , that is why it is important to think long and hard about the choices that we make because we can never go back and change the choices that we have made . This movie has a great setting ; it was filmed mostly in Bangkok Thailand . This film also has great music ; a few of my favorite songs are ' Silence ' by Delerium , ' Damaged ' by Plumb , ' Deliver me ' by Sarah Bightman and ' Party 's just begun ' by Nelly Furtado . I went out and bought the soundtrack after watching this film . These girls where young and naive and failed to think their plans out thoroughly , a mistake that anyone could make , therefore this film is good for any audience . It makes no difference young or old -- we all are human and subject to mistakes . Even though , I did not like the way this film ended leaving me in question of --who really smuggled the drugs ? -- I would definitely give this film two thumbs up .
neg	Here 's how you do it : Believe in God and repent for your sins . Then things should turn around within the next day or so .   Until the last fifteen minutes , this movie just plays as a bad recap of a drunk 's crappy life . His mom dies . His stepmom 's a b_tch . His dad dies . He drinks . He gets married . He has kids . He drinks some more . His wife gets mad . He disappoints his kids . The wife threatens to leave . He calls up a reverend late night b / c he wants to kill himself . Then after the recap happens , that 's when we get the " Left Behind "- like subtle message . " He needed a paycheck " . This is the phrase I had to repeat over and over once credits started to roll so I would n't lose my respect for Madsen . Madsen drops to his knees and begs Christ 's forgiveness . Once he does , he walks outside and actually says that he sees the world in a different way . He tells his wife that he 's found God and that 's good enough for her . Flip scene four months and the wife is tired of going to church . End the movie as Madsen walks by the bar and gives a soliloquy about how happy he is with Christ and without alcohol . Final moment ? He gives a little dismissive wave to the bar ( i.e. sin house ) and give a gay , Miami - Vice , after - school special congratulatory jump in the air as the camera freeze - frames . See why I had to repeat the phrase ? " He needed a paycheck " . Man this movie is bad . The B - Grade 80 's production values do n't help much . The script could have easily been a " Touched By An Angel " episode . It could have been knocked out in 30 minutes plus commercials . The acting is wooden and never believable . Even Madsen , of whom I 'm a big fan and is the sole reason I sat through this , makes it clear that this is his first acting job and he does n't know his a$$ from his elbow yet on camera . 45 minutes into it I started to get discouraged . This thing was like homework . I just wanted to put it away and say that alright , I saw half of it . That 's good enough . But no . If I sat through Cheerleader Ninjas , I could sit throughout this . The only reason I 'm not giving this thing a 1 is for two points : 1 ) I love Madsen . I know it 's not fair . But it 's great seeing the opening title " Introducing Michael Madsen " . Sue me . 2 ) Some of the Dialogue is so bad that it 's classic . I 'll stick some quotes at the end of this so you can enjoy them too . That 's about it . To wrap it up , this thing is a piece of crap that should stay flushed with the rest of the turds . But hey ! Look ! Michael Madsen ! ( See also TILT , EXECUTIVE TARGET , MY BOSS 'S DAUGHTER , etc ) . Now I 've got ta rewatch Reservoir Dogs and watch Madsen torture a cop to get my respect back for him . See ya , Kids . " This stuff 's gon na make me go blind , but I 'm gon na drink it anyway " - Madsen 's first taste of cheap alcohol " I do n't understand ! Everything seems so beautiful ! " - Madsen walking outside after confessing to God " I 'm going downtown later and pick up a bible and I 'm gon na get a haircut too " - Madsen after converting at the dinner table , because Satan lives in your hair
pos	This movie was very funny , I could n't stop smiling when watching this and have already watched it twice in a period of 2 days ! The movie is distinctively unique in it 's humor and visuals , both are terrific and on par with Natali 's other ( more serious ) movie gems Cube and Cypher . I have become a huge Vincenzo Natali fan ever since watching Cypher and everything he 's made is very interesting . Very likable about this movie are the music and " loser " characters Dave and Andrew , portrayed by David Hewlett and Andrew Miller ( co - writer of the story ) , actors I both like very much . Also cool are the X - Box Dead Or Alive fights ( you even see Dave playing Halo at a point ) and Andrew 's amazing guitar solo , among many other things . All in all a great feel - good film about friendship . You have to see this !
neg	I was very disappointed by this movie . I thought that " Scary Movie " although not a great movie was very good and funny . " Scary Movie 2 " on the other hand was boring , not funny , and at times plain stupid . The Exorcist / Amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie . James Woods was great . Now , I 'll admit that I am at a disadvantage since I have not seen a few of the movies that this parodies unlike the first , where I had basically seen them all . But bad comedy is still bad comedy . Something that really hurt this movie was the timing , which ruined some of what might have been good jokes . Scenes and jokes drag out way to long . Also , the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again . For example , the talking bird . Ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time . But it kept getting repeated to the point of annoying . The routine between the wheelchair guy and Hanson ( Chris Elliott ) was amusing at first but it kept getting repeated and ended up stupid and even tasteless . Some jokes even got repeated from the first movie . For example , the ' creaming ' I guess you would call it of Cindy ( Anna Faris ) was funny in " Scary Movie " because Cindy had been holding out on giving her boyfriend sex for so long , that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he ' creamed ' her . But this time around it was out of place and not funny . The bathroom and sexual humor in general was more amusing and well timed the first time around . The scat humor was excessive though and rather unneccessary in the second film . Tori Spelling was annoying and really had no place in this movie . But I did enjoy Shorty ( Marlon Wayans ) who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first film . The scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second film . Do n't get me wrong , I love the Wayans family and their humor . That is why this film is so disappointing . . . they have a lot more comic ability than endless scat jokes .
pos	This is the second Baby Burlesk short to be released , and probably the most popular one , is a spoof of the 1926 silent film What Price Glory . I watched this and I do not understand the kiddie - porn that is being claimed . It is just a cute little film . I have seen family shows that I grew up watching in the ' 80 's and ' 90 's that had little girls dressed more provocatively acting in a ' mature manner ' . It was more provocative because they WEREN'T dressed in diapers . There 's nothing provocative about a diaper unless you have one of those fetishes . ( just a joke ) I read that description of the movie and where it states only a pedophile would enjoy watching this . That is sick . To me , if you watch this and are bothered by it , then maybe you need to look into your own psyche and try to figure out why it bothers you . It is an innocent film that was made as a parody of another film . All of the B.B. films were parodies , nothing more . The parodies / spoofs of today are graphic in nature and have true almost pornographic scenes and quite vile language . Should n't those be more appalling ? I can watch those without issue , but they sometimes take children 's stories and turn them into filth on those parodies . That is what should get under your skin . Not that they babified ( not a word , I know ) an adult movie from 1926 , because we know how PORNOGRAPHIC those silent films were , huh ? Not to mention those ' Forbidden Hollywood Pre - Code era films ' so vile and filthy . They would NEVER make such filth today ? ( note the sarcasm )
neg	That reviewers liked this movie surprises me . The plot is a muddle . The characters are wooden . Michael Bowen spends most of the film spying on the other characters and misjudging all of them . No one has any redeeming quality or point - of - interest . This is not an edgy work . It is not imaginative . It is not ironic . It is no clever . There is nothing straight forward about this tedious work . That is missed theatrical release is not surprise . That the " This Network " airs it diminishes that venue . I definitely recommend turning to a rerun of the Garden Smart show on PBS or even a good informational if you encountered this mess on late night television . If you encounter it on daytime television , take a long walk . Even if you walk in smog , you will feel better not having suffered through this shambles . Life is short . This movie is long .
pos	Although there were a few rough spots and some plot lines that were n't exactly true to character , this was Classic H : LOTS . The characters , outside of Mike Giardello ( Giancarlo Esposito ) , were true to form , and the reunion scenes of Pembleton ( Andre Braugher ) and Bayliss ( Kyle Secor ) were as deep and well acted as anything ever to grace the small screen . " Homicide : The Movie " aka " Life Everlasting " is a fan flick , but stands on its own as well as any 2-hour episode of the series . Fontana , Overmeyer and Yoshimura did a wonderful job in pulling loose ends from 7 seasons and every major cast member of " the best damn show on television " together for the series finale that NBC never bothered to give it . True to " Homicide " form , there were no happy endings , such is life . That 's what has always set this show apart from the mindless cookie - cutter cop shows left on television . Kudos to the writers and the cast for creating something over the span of the series and in the movie that challenged television viewers and producers alike . * * I call myself a " Homicidal Maniac " if for no other reason than to keep my co - workers in a cooperative mood . * *
neg	In 1967 , mine workers find the remnants of an ancient vanished civilization named Abkani that believe there are the worlds of light and darkness . When they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago , something evil slipped through before the gate was closed . Twenty - two years ago , the Government Paranormal Research Agency Bureau 713 was directed by Professor Lionel Hudgens ( Matthew Walker ) , who performed experiments with orphan children . On the present days , one of these children is the paranormal investigator Edward Carnby ( Christian Slater ) , who has just gotten an Abkani artifact in South America , and is chased by a man with abilities . When an old friend of foster house disappears in the middle of the night , he discloses that demons are coming back to Earth . With the support of the anthropologist Aline Cedrac ( Tara Reid ) and the leader of the Bureau 713 , Cmdr . Richard Burke ( Stephen Dorff ) , and his squad , they battle against the evil creatures . In spite of having a charismatic good cast , leaded by Christian Slater , Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff , " Alone in the Dark " never works and is a complete mess , without development of characters or plot . The reason may be explained by the " brilliant " interview of director Uwe Boll in the Extras of the DVD , where he says that " videogames are the bestsellers of the younger generations that are not driven by books anymore " . Further , his target audience would be people aged between twelve and twenty - five years old . Sorry , but I find both assertions disrespectful with the younger generations . I have a daughter and a son , and I know many of their friends and they are not that type of stupid stereotype the director says . Further , IMDb provides excellent statistics to show that Mr. Uwe Boll is absolutely wrong . My vote is three . Title ( Brazil ) : " Alone in the Dark  O Despertar do Mal " ( " Alone in the Dark  The Awakening of the Evil " )
pos	This show is about three little girls . ( D.J , Stephanie , and Michelle ) Their Mother is killed by a drunk driver so their father Danny invites his Brother - in - law ( Jesse ) and his Old Friend(Joey ) . So the whole show is about living life . The girls go through life 's troubles and have life lessons . They develop crushes , boyfriends , and many more . The whole show is basically about to go with the flow . You do not have to hold grudges you just have to let it go . I think this show is really good and fun to watch . I grew up watching this show and still watch it today . I am glad they still air this show on television . I watch it almost every day . I rate it 10/10 .
neg	Despite the gravity of the subject and probably the good intentions of the filmmakers to make a film addressing white supremacy , the inconsistencies of its main character , Bronson Green , aspiring New York actor easily turned L.A. phony , makes it hard to take the story seriously . Green , who is constantly rejected by Los Angeles casting agents for being obsolete ( i.e. too New York when the 80s is looking for big , blonde , and dumb ) , he finds success comes easily when he 's willing to succumb to falsifying his image . Unfortunately , the new hair dye and pacified " surfer " attitude lands him an acting opportunity with the Jericho Church , which subscribes white supremacist teaching of the Aryan nation . Green is willing to easily forget his past , and particularly turning his back on his young black friend of ten years , in order to be the Church 's new spokesman . This makes no sense , seeing as how principled our character initially is . It is this sudden , and loose change in character , coupled with an abrupt reversion back to the hardened , DeNiro - obsessed ( as his Taxi Driver character ) form who is able to battle the villains . A noble attempt on the filmmakers , but one that ultimately reveals itself as anything but serious . The other characters , too , are quite annoying and what we are forced to recognize in them comes too easily -- the psychotic paranoia of the Church leader , the self - interested actress girlfriend ( the first girlfriend Bronson has when he 's in L.A. ) , and the new blonde girlfriend who 's character lacks so much development , she is , for the most part , just a walking , talking void . We are just supposed to see them in fleeting moments in which something random forces us to draw assumptions about the characters . But there is really little development of any of them . The other problem with this film is the ungodly amount of time the characters are involved in very little important action . Much of the beginning concerns introducing the characters , obviously , and later we see Bronson 's difficulties with breaking into the L.A. acting scene and the frustrations which stem from constant rejection . But after he does willingly change his looks and personality in order to become accepted , there is at least a good twenty minutes to thirty minutes of wasted film in which very little of anything happens . For films that seek to draw attention to the irrational fears behind racism , this was not one done with enough credibility .
pos	I was all ready to pan this episode , seeing that this ' Master ' really does n't have any horror films under his belt .. but this is easily the best episode of the season . The acting was good ! ! I do n't know how he wrangled it , but we 've got some real talent in this episode ! And while you could see things coming from a mile away plot wise , at least it was entertaining and managed to keep me engaged for the full 56 mins , something that has been lacking up to this point in the series . I especially liked the bit at the end , not a twist per say , but just a funny little bit where he becomes , as ever , the hen - pecked hubby . Really good effort . Like I 've said in other reviews- these are not true masters doing a lot of these episodes .. but they may someday end up being masters in the future .
neg	... this verson does n't mangle the Bard that badly . It 's still a horrible minimalist production , Hamlet 's Dutch uncle is inexplicably dubbed by a Spaniard ( whether it 's Ricardo Montalban or not is subject to debate ) , and Maximilian Schell overacts like never before . Most of the dialogue makes it through unscathed , and the fact that the MST3 K version feels obliged to point out repeatedly that the speeches are long * duh * does n't strike me as incredibly humorous . Mostly it 's just bad acting , though .
pos	For me this is Ealing Studio 's most perfect film - as fresh and relevant half a century later as it was the day it was released . As a satire on economic notions of ' growth ' and the commercial need for in - built obsolescence , it could scarcely be more up - to - the - minute . And of what other film can it be said that the hero literally wears the plot ? Oddly , there are parallels with Jurassic Park , in which messing with the environment will literally turn round and bite you . But Spielberg shied away from the book 's brilliant central conceit to tack on some nonsense about ' children ' . Hmmm . In The Man In The White Suit , Alec Guiness plays an idealistic young scientist who comes up with a cloth that never gets dirty and never wears out . Suddenly workers and capital at the northern English mill where he is working are united as never before in protection of their livelihoods . Of course , being Ealing , it 's a comedy , but it need n't have been . The complex interplay of vested ( should that be suited ? ) interests plays out beautifully , as one by one all parties realize that ' progress ' is a threat , and that disposability and waste are what keep the looms turning . But , yes , this is a comedy - albeit a pointed one - and amid the political ironies are delicious performances , and some good old - fashioned knock - about laughs . Nonetheless , it 's the biting satire that endures - dazzling and white .
neg	I could barely keep myself from either nodding off or just turning off this turd , but I decided to stick it out if only for the reasoning that maybe * something * would happen . This is the work of a writer / producer / director / special fx , Kenneth Herts , who wants to make a statement on ecological damage while making a monster movie . That 's what he wanted , anyway . What it turns out to be is a lot of acting , either slightly hammy or just mundane and without much merit , and scenes that seem to repeat themselves as the monster ATTACKS in the river waters ( oh , and what luck , a woman just happens to be naked in it ... even though there have already been DISAPPEARANCES ! )   This is just nonsensical stuff , but I suppose it 's not too harmful ; it 's not very obnoxious at the least and once or twice we get a semi - interesting peek at Brazilian " culture " ( which is the father walking through town with his flock or other pieces of a semblance of ' hey , this is NOT America ! ' ) . But whatever hope the director had in casting Mitchum or Carradine is squandered on at best pedestrian and at worst excruciatingly banal and dumb dialog . It does n't help that when we finally get something of a good look at the monster and the " action " happens , it too is stupidly staged and with only sleazy appeal . Usually I would feel sorry for a filmmaker who had a lot of problems getting a particular picture finished- in this case it took the better part of the mid 70s- but with Monstroid or Monster or whatever it 's called ... nah . If you happen to get the Elvira DVD double - feature of this ( bad print with bad transfer quality ) with Blue Sunshine , make sure to skip this one . Unless , of course , you 're an Elvira die - hard and ca n't help yourself to hear her luscious commentary ; personally , I 'd rather get Joel or Mike Nelson with the robots from Mystery Science Theater on this roast turkey .
pos	Years ago , I found a " bargain bin " copy of this film for a buck or two . In so many ways , this is quite fitting , as when it was made back in 1933 , it was truly a cheaply made film by the " poverty row " studio , Majestic . However , while the film is rather derivative , it is STILL well worth watching and provides a few surprises . The story is very , very familiar , as in some Germanic town , the people are upset because of some recent deaths that appear to be the work of vampires ! Adding to this familiarity is Dwight Frye . He played Renfield in Dracula , and here he is very , very similar -- though he plays a much more harmless weirdo . In this case , he 's obsessed with his pet bats and people begin to blame him for the deaths . The film does a good job of providing some " red herrings " ( i.e. , false leads ) and while it does n't take a genius to figure out Frye may not be responsible , the WHO and WHY are intriguing and make it VERY different from the average horror film . In addition , while the production had little money to speak of , it still had some good actors of the day -- Lionel Atwill and Melvin Douglas -- and it also used Universal Studios sets at night ( when they were done filming for the day ) . As a result , the film looks pretty good overall , though I also thought that , as usual , Fay Wray was terrible -- thought it did n't noticeably detract from the film . I have seen her in more movies than most people on IMDb and I have come to notice that her characters have no depth -- she always seems to be cast as the " screaming lady " and provides little new in each film . Overall , for fans of old horror films , this is excellent and worth seeing . For people who are NOT fans of the genre , it 's probably pretty skip - able .
neg	Without a doubt , this is one of the worst pictures I ever actually paid money to see - the kind of flick you choose out of desperation at the mall cinema during a Christmas holiday when you have missed the start times for anything good but still are dead set on seeing a movie ! And that is exactly how I came to see this stink bomb ... At the distance of the better part of three decades I can still smell the rotting fish that constitute this story line . Unbelievable plot - that a killer whale carries a grudge against an individual not of the sea - is laughable . And that 's about all , except for a completely out - of - place " love theme " that plays over the finish of a film devoid of a love story . At least Charlotte Rampling is lovely ( in a two dimensional role ) but Richard Harris just chews up the scenery . He was no Captain Quint ( Robert Shaw ) and this is no " Jaws " . Mercifully , I have put most of it out of mind and when I run across it on television air casts I move on immediately . " Danger , Will Robinson ! " See the current t.v . commercial showing a husband and wife whale - watching ( " Orca - I love Orca ... " ) - at least it is over in sixty seconds . This flick represents 92 minutes of my life that I will never get back .

neg	Identical twin sisters Mary - Kate and Ashley Olsen climbed to fame in sitcoms like " Two of a Kind " , I had never seen them in anything before , but I had an idea of what to expect , but it was much worse . Basically the Hunter sisters Charli ( Mary - Kate ) and Leila ( Ashley ) are in Rome for a Summer Intern Program , but not long after starting their jobs they are immediately fired for a series of mishaps . But the man who owns the company they are working in , Derek Hammond ( Julian Stone ) , gives them their jobs back , and they they do slowly prove themselves useful assets , and talented ( fashion ) artists , and help stop a mean man taking over the company . Also starring Leslie Danon as Jami , Derek Lee Nixon as Ryan , Ilenia Lazzarin as Dari , Archie Kao as Nobu , Valentina Mattolini as Heidi , Michelangelo Tommaso as Paolo and Matt Patresi as Enrico Tortoni . You can tell that this film was made to go straight to video , the camera - work is completely mismatched , and it does n't help when you want to admire the sights of Rome . In fact the background is the only good thing to watch , the twin sisters are two of the most annoying celebrities around , I knew before watching that they were n't going to interest me in any way ( their not even that pretty ) , this is awful gush of rubbish film . Pretty poor !
pos	I thought this movie was fantastic . It was hilarious . Kinda reminded me of Spinal Tap . This is a must see for any fan of 70 's rock . ( I hope me and my friends are n't like that in twenty years ! ) Bill Nighy gives an excellent performance as the off kilter lead singer trying to recapture that old spirit , Stephen Rea fits perfectly into the movie as the glue trying to hold the band together , but not succeeding well . If you love music , and were ever in a band , this movie is definitely for you . You wo n't regret seeing this movie . I know I do n't . Even my family found it funny , and that 's saying something .
neg	In the autobiographical coming - of - age tale " Romulus , My Father , " Eric Bana , of " Munich " fame , plays an impoverished German émigré struggling to raise his son , Raymond ( Kodi Smit - McPhee ) , in rural 1960 's Australia . The major obstacle to the family 's stability and happiness is his wife , Christina ( Franka Potente ) , who flagrantly violates her wedding vows by shamelessly shacking up with other men . Despite her highly unconventional behavior , Romulus refuses to grant her a divorce , masochistically torturing himself in the vain hope that she will one day return to him . It is , unfortunately , the good - hearted and good - natured Raimond who must bear witness to all this marital turmoil - and it is his memoir that serves as the basis for the movie ( Raimond Gaita would later grow up to be an author ) . Even though I admire " Romulus , My Father " for what it is trying to do , I ca n't honestly say I enjoyed it , for while the film has some fine performances and serious intentions going for it , these simply are n't enough to counteract the dour storyline and funereal pacing , which leave the audience as despairing and depressed as the people on screen . A serious slice - of - life drama is one thing , but this unremittingly downbeat wallow in adultery , insanity and multiple suicides ( let alone attempted suicides ) is something else again .
pos	The 74th Oscars was a very good one . Whoopi 's work as EmCee was very funny , and light . I personally loved her last apperance , which garnered some frigid reviews due to coarse language and salacious jokes , but that 's fine . The audience seemed to like it . Halle Berry , Denzel Washington , Ron Howard , Woody Allen , and Sidney Poitier made this an Oscar telecast to remember .
neg	believe it or not , this movie is worse than number three.it's slower , the acting is worse , and the story is very weak.there is n't a lot of good to say about this movie.even the fight scenes are more dull than number three , and i would have thought that impossible.this is a very slow 90 minutes.painful,in fact.i stuck it through , hoping it would get better.if you really want to see this movie , you should try to find a cheap rental of it.it is hard to find(for purchase , that is)and probably for good reason.like number three , this movie has nothing to do with the first two.it is the same in name only.anyway,the most i can give Best of the Best : Without Warning is 2/10
pos	This crime thriller is sort of like a film noir , though changes the context from post - war to Cold War and has something relatively decent to say about humanity . In " Pickup on South Street " , policemen are good guys , criminals are genuine guys , and the only enemies are " The Commies " , who are ultimately differentiated from the good - guys in that they are emotionally personable , driven by an actual care for their own worth , as shown in the constant tracked - in close - ups that speckle the movie . This movie revolves around characters . The personalities in this film are rather unique and detailed : Skip the pick - pocket who is able to stare down any danger , and sometimes while going through their personal possessions ; Moe the informer who is just trying to save up for a spectacular funeral , but who manages to capture the hearts and respect of nearly all the other characters ( and the audience ) ; Candy , the ill - named innocent girl who only thinks she 's doing government work and does n't fully comprehend the conspiracy she 's involved with ; and Joey , the ex - boyfriend evil Commie baddie who is trying to hide everything from everybody and , ironically , is the worst person at doing it . Throw in a bunch of very colorful supporting characters ( such as the guy with the chopsticks and the policemen ) and " Pickup on South Street " treats you to a splendor of personalities as they hunt down the mysterious and accidentally stolen microfilm frames . --PolarisDiB

pos	North Africa in the 1930 's . To a small Arab town on the edge of the Sahara comes a beautiful woman looking for meaning to her life & a handsome Trappist monk fleeing from his crisis of faith . They will meet and passions will be stirred , but not even the Sand Diviner knows if they will find happiness or sorrow , here , in THE GARDEN OF ALLAH . The plot is pure hokum , but the film is still great fun & beautiful to look at . Marlene Dietrich & Charles Boyer are a superb screen couple . She is , to put it simply , gorgeous , and Boyer gives a most effective , understated performance , letting his sensitive face do much of his acting for him .   The supporting cast is excellent : Basil Rathbone , in a sympathetic role as a Count who loves the desert ; Joseph Schildkraut as a friendly , talkative guide ( all the " Arabic " he & others speak in the film is pure gibberish ) ; Lucile Watson as a gentle Mother Superior ; Alan Marshal as an honorable young French officer ; Tilly Losch as a dangerous dancer ; Henry Brandon as a comic porter ; John Carradine as the mysterious Sand Diviner ; and magnificent Sir C. Aubrey Smith as a wise old priest . Movie mavens will recognize Helen Jerome Eddy as a nun ; Marcia Mae Jones & Bonita Granville ( peeking over the nun 's shoulder ) as convent girls ; gaunt Nigel De Brulier as a monastery lector ; and Ferdinand Gottschalk as a hotel clerk , all uncredited . Color films of the 1930 's are both rare & lovely to look at , and this movie is no exception - the cinematography is as colorful as the desert itself . THE GARDEN OF ALLAH was the first Technicolor film to be shot on location . Yuma , Arizona gave the film makers all the sand dunes they could desire , but contaminated drinking water & 135 degree heat soon had the company in revolt . When the daily rushes showed Boyer 's face had burned a bright tomato red , producer David O. Selznick finally gave in . The remainder of the film was shot on a Hollywood sound stage .
neg	WOW ! Why would anybody make a sequel to an already rancid film ? Half Past Dead was a bad movie but at least at had an idea of what it wanted to be . HPD2 has no clue of what it wants to be . It just exists on screen for reasons I ca nt explain . Spoiler : The whole movie is this : Twitch(played by Kurupt of Tha Dogg Pound ) gets transferred to another jail where there might be a box filled with gold bricks buried . In the jail , a riot breaks out between rival inmates , one of them gets shot by a guy named Cortez and Cortez plans his escape . During a conjugal visit , Twitch 's fiancée and Burke's(played by Bill Goldberg)daughter get kidnapped by Cortez and are held in an execution room . Burke reluctantly befriends Twitch and they end up getting into trouble with the idiotic inmates while finding out that Cortez has their loved ones . Opinion : This is the most unnecessary sequel since Universal Soldier : The Return . The script is terrible , the acting is horrendous , the dialog is a joke and everybody in this movie is a caricature . Look , I know it was low budget film but that is not an excuse for these guys to not put effort into what they do . Nobody in this " movie " believes in the characters they play . Nobody in this " movie can be taken seriously as an actor . Kurupt should be ashamed of himself . His character " Twitch " is pretty much a spineless minstrel puppet who spends most of his time posing while getting jacked up by Burke or the other inmates . Bill Goldberg spends most of his time sulking throughout the movie as if he had to take a PHD(pretty huge dump ) . The fight scenes are poorly choreographed and pathetic and for an action movie HPD2 is pretty boring even when action is happening ! Do n't let anybody tell you that this movie is somewhat decent . It stinks and is a prime reason why people despise Follywood .
pos	I saw this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and was completely blown away . The structure and execution of the film was fantastic ... I know it wo n't , but it really deserves an Oscar nod . Cal and Andre were phenomenal as the two disturbed classmates . Yes , the film is very controversial and I can see a lot of people having a lot of problems with it , as it deals with school shooting and especially makes you identify with the killers . However , despite its harsh and blunt subject matter , Zero Day is SO worth watching . I 'm looking forward to it coming out on video so I can buy it - it 's very , very good . Very powerful and intense ... the end shooting sequence leaves you speechless because it 's almost too realistic . Their uncertainty , the " recordings " , the footage and panic of the students , totally indescribable . I really hope it gets the attention it deserves . It 's done in the same format as The Blair Witch Project , handheld camera , made to appear as a true home video documentary kind of film - but god is it INFINITELY better . Very impressive , hats off to everyone involved . If you 've got the chance you really should see it .
neg	Even if you could get past the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed every Significant Moment of the 1960s ( ok , so Katie did n't join the Manson Family , and nobody died at Altamont ) , this movie was still unbelievably awful . I got the impression that the " writers " just locked themselves in a room and watched " Forrest Gump , " " The Wonder Years , " and Oliver Stone 's 60s films over and over again and called it research . A Canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode " head spinning " . He was right .
pos	I thought this movie did a down right good job . It was n't as creative or original as the first , but who was expecting it to be . It was a whole lotta fun . the more i think about it the more i like it , and when it comes out on DVD I 'm going to pay the money for it very proudly , every last cent . Sharon Stone is great , she always is , even if her movie is horrible(Catwoman ) , but this movie is n't , this is one of those movies that will be underrated for its lifetime , and it will probably become a classic in like 20 yrs . Do n't wait for it to be a classic , watch it now and enjoy it . Do n't expect a masterpiece , or something that s gripping and soul touching , just allow yourself to get out of your life and get yourself involved in theirs . All in all , this movie is entertaining and i recommend people who have n't seen it see it , because what the critics and box office say does n't always count , see it for yourself , you never know , you might just enjoy it . I tip my hat to this movie 8/10
neg	Unfortunately this film , 54 was a pathetic attempt of the true story of ' Studio 54 . ' The only thing that was good about the picture was ' Mike Myers ' who was a joy to watch . ' Neve Cambpell , ' although her role was little was unfortunately bad . The bottom line is that this film lacked a good performance from the actors , except one and that the conversion of the true story was a desperate attempt for a good screenplay .
pos	I 've watched it plenty of times and I 'm planning on buying the full feature . I love all of Jason Steele 's comedy . It 's very different and unique and is very enjoyable . I love indie films and this one is just great . The plot is strange but very funny . This short film is about a talking Spatula named Edward . The order of the events are a bit jumbled , making this film very interesting to watch . At first you see Edward fighting the spoons , but then the focus changes to earlier in his life . This is a silly movie , but of course , it 's still great . I highly recommend that you watch this film at www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com . It 's very funny . The humour may not match everybody 's taste but watch anyway . It 'll only take 16 minutes of your time , and it 's free . GO WATCH SPATULA MADNESS !
neg	Anne Bancroft plays Estelle , a dying Jewish mother who asks her devoted son ( Ron Silver ) to locate reclusive one - time movie star Greta Garbo and introduce the two before Estelle checks out for good . Might 've been entitled " Bancroft Talks " as the actress assaults this uncertain comedic / dramatic / sentimental material for its duration . Hot - or - cold director Sidney Lumet ca n't get a consistent rhythm going , and Bancroft 's constant overacting is n't scaled back at all by the filmmaker -- he keeps her right upfront : cute , teary - eyed and ranting . Estelle becomes a drag on this scenario ( not that the thinly - conceived plot has much going on besides ) . Silver and co - stars Carrie Fisher and Catherine Hicks end up with very little to do but support the star , and everyone is trampled by her hamming . * 1/2 from * * * *
pos	I watch a lot of films , good , bad and indifferent ; there is usually something of interest to fixate upon , even if it is only set design , or the reliable labor of a good character actor , or the fortuitous laughter that emerges from watching ineptitude captured forever . However , I was quite pleasantly surprised by this film , one I had never seen before . Graham Greene has been translated into film many times of course , in such masterpieces as " Thin Man " and in lesser vehicles . " Confidential Agent " is one of those lesser vehicles , yet it manages to get me somewhere anyway , despite lackluster direction , the incongruity of Bacall and Boyer 's depictions as ( respectively ) British and Spanish , and the almost complete non - existence of any chemistry between the two leads . In some ways , this last " problem " actually begins to work in the film 's favor , for how can love really blossom in the killing atmosphere of fascism and capitalism meeting about one person 's tragedy ? The most compelling aspect of the film arises directly from Greene 's complex and guilt - ridden psychology , which pervades the film . I know some see the deliberate pacing here as dull , and I can understand that . Yet I found that plodding accentuated rather than detracted from what is a claustrophobic world . I was compelled to watch , not by any great acting ( although Boyer is marvelous as usual , managing to convey a rich mixture of world - weariness , tragedy , hope , and fervor with his magnificent voice and yearning eyes ) , but by the down - spiraling rush of one man 's slim hopes against a world of oppression and money . What is a thief ? What good is love in the face of death ? Where does mere profit - taking end and exploitation begin ? The film does not rise to the level of art , and thus can not hope to answer such questions , but it is much more than mere entertainment , and its murders and guilts are very grimly drawn . The lack of glitz , of " bubble , " of narrative " bounce " help to make this movie very worthwhile . And there is no happy ending , for history wrote the ending .
neg	It 's difficult to know where this adaptation starts going wrong , because I think the problem begins with the books themselves . Alexander McCall Smith has worked out that you read them not for the detective stories , but for his deeply condescending and completely spurious vision of an Africa that does not exist . He 's done for Botswana what Borat did for Kazakhstan - not as successfully , but based in as much fact . Once I realised this , it ceased to gall me that Jill Scott , an American singer / actress , is cast as Mma Ramotswe . If she is to represent a land that is not Africa , how appropriate that she is a black woman who is not African ? She 's not the only American on the cast ; Mma Makutsi is played by Anika Noni Rose . Both women are far , far too young for the roles they 're playing , and far too glamorous . Both brutally murder the local accents , and both focus so entirely on this brutality that they fail to offer much in the way of acting . Scott 's Mma Ramotswe is bouncy , cute and soft . Rose 's Mma Makutsi is an annoying motor - mouthed bitch . The result is almost unwatchable . The principal cast is redeemed only by the presence of Lucian Msamati , who turns in a decent performance as Mr JLB Matekoni . He s comes off smarter and more intense than in the books , but I find myself unable to blame Msamati for this - he 's a shining light in an ocean of suckage . The contradictions between his performance and the books are clearly laid at the feet of whichever committee of butchers wrote the script . To me , McCall Smith 's writing has always been highly entertaining yet notoriously bad . He refuses to be edited . As a result , his books contain experiments in grammar that border on the scientific , and characters that change name mid - sentence . It is therefore something of an achievement that the writing team on this project actually made it worse . The dialogue is now largely Anglicised . Characters speak of " opening up " and " sensitivity to needs " . Mma Ramotswe and Mr JLB Matekoni flirt openly . Mma Makutsi moans about not having a computer , but given her constantly restyled hair , makeup and jewellery , I 'm surprised she does n't have a MacBook in her handbag along with her Visa card . So what are we left with here ? It 's difficult to be upset with this crappy adaptation because honestly , most of the things I like about the original books are apocryphal anyway . McCall Smith paints a fictional Botswana populated with cute , non - threatening black people who are full of amusing and palatable wisdom - nuggets . It reads well despite linguistic travesty , but it is a vision of how a certain type of white person wishes black people were . It just is n't true . Given that , it 's hardly surprising that this show sucks as much as it does . It remains to be seen whether European and American audiences will even notice , however .
pos	Julian Noble ( Pierce Brosnan ) is a hit - man . Or a " facilitator of fatalities " , as he prefers to be called . He is also a drunk , a womaniser , and in the middle of a mid - life crisis . On a job in Mexico City , he bumps into Danny White ( Greg Kinnear ) , an unconfident businessman who thinks he 's just nailed a recent pitch , but is unsure . They meet in the hotel bar late one night , after they 've both had a few too many margaritas . Sounds like the set - up for a by - the - numbers comedy thriller , does n't it ? But it is n't . Instead , The Matador is a funny and sometimes touching character study . It avoids every twist that the above summary would suggest , sometimes even setting them up just to gleefully tear them down . It is a film that respects it characters enough to just let them get on with it , without feeling the need to shove them into needless plot contrivances . Brosnan 's hit - man will inevitably be compared to his Bond , but this is unfair to both performances . Bond is a half - formed idea , a product of all that has gone before ; while Julian is a fully - formed character with his own motivations and flaws . He has existed in his own shadowy , seedy world for so long that he has forgotten how to talk to another human being . When he meets Danny in the hotel bar , he sees his opposite : a normal guy with a normal job and normal problems . He envies Danny ; the hit - man has become fed up with his life , sees himself edging ever closer to his inevitable " burn out " , as he puts it . But when Danny opens up about the death of his only son , Julian tries to change the subject with a dirty joke . He is a man who has , in his own words , been " running from any emotion . " Kinnear holds his own opposite Brosnan 's performance , and injects Danny White with his effortless everyman charm . He is the perfect foil to Julian ; while the latter is drunken bravado and hedonism , Danny is down to earth , with just a hint of eccentricity . But he too goes deeper than his established persona , showing us how far the everyman will go when faced with financial and familial ruin . There is real chemistry between Brosnan and Kinnear . It is most visible in the film 's three key scenes : the hotel bar ; a bullfight , during which Julian tells Danny what he does for a living , and takes him through a dress rehearsal of an assassination ; and a scene in which Julian turns up at Danny 's house six months later . This scene also introduces us properly to Danny 's wife , Bean ( yes , Bean ) . In another example of how much The Matador respects its characters , Bean ( Hope Davis ) , instead of panicking at the presence of a hired killer in her house , merely asks with forced calm , " Did you bring your gun ? " The script is n't quite as good as could have been after maybe another rewrite . One or two lines seem a little forced , and a couple of the jokes need a little more work . But in the scenes where Julian and Danny ( and later Bean ) just talk , the writing is superb . The film feels no need to put the characters in any outlandish situations ( other than meeting a hit - man , and said hit - man turning up on your doorstep ) . It just lets them talk , gently nudging them toward necessary plot points . There is action , but only when it reflects on the characters . One notable instance is when Julian botches a job in Budapest because he keeps seeing himself through his rifles scope . The rest of the film is about the characters , how they interact , how they each affect one another . And , ultimately , it is about friendship , even in the most unlikely of places . At one point Julian tells Danny that he is his only friend . And he really means it .
neg	Perhaps one of the worst teenage slasher films I ever did see . I 'll start with the bad points of t he movie , which pretty much covers the entire film . First of all , something no one can avoid : TERRIBLE ACTING . I swear they picked up some random kids off the street based on how they looked . Secondly , BAD / UNCONVINCING CHARACTER WORK / DEVELOPMENT . You hardly even know half the kids who are killed in here . All you figure is that they deserved it one way or another . The scarecrow 's character was overdone , and a cheap rip - off of the other great fantasy killers such as Freddy or Pinhead . Next : BAD DIALOG : The Scarecrow was full of horrid one - liners that would make you laugh , only because it was so terrible . Lines like " Let 's go find some small animals to torture ! " really just leaves you with an eyebrow raised . Last but not least : Next off : BAD CASTING . How old was the guy who played Lester ? Like 30 ? The back of his head was balding for God 's sake . There is much more I could say about this film , like it 's cheap special effects , it 's " high school film class " effort , but the point is understood . It 's just bad film making at it 's worst . As for what I found to be " good " in the movie : -Entertaining for those with low , low , LOW standards -Would help put insomniacs to sleep . -A very cheap laugh , or even a giggle .
pos	Sniper gives a true new meaning to war movies . I remember movies about Vietnam or WWII , lots of firing , everybody dies , bam bam . " Sniper " takes war to a new level or refinement . The movie certainly conveys all of the emotions it aims for - The helplessness of humans in the jungle , the hatred and eventual trust between Beckett and Miller , and the rush of the moment when they pull the trigger . A seemingly low - budget film makes up for every flaw with action , suspense , and thrill , because when it comes down to it , it 's just one shot , one kill .
neg	Robert Forster , normally a very strong character actor , is lost at sea here cast as a New York family man seeking revenge on the thugs who murdered his son and attacked his wife in a home invasion . Scary subject matter exploited for cheapjack thrills in the " Death Wish " vein . It is n't difficult to scoff at these smarmy proceedings : the dialogue is full of howlers , the crime statistics are irrevocably dated , and the supporting characters are ridiculously over - written ( particularly a despicable judge who allows an accused murderer to walk right out of the courtroom ) . Low - rent production is contemptible in its self - righteousness , especially as the violence in our cities has only increased . * from * * * *
pos	This film is famous for several qualities : a literate script , for once in partly - religious film - making , by Philip Dunne , some very good performances , a first - rate production in every department and its intelligent direction by veteran Henry King . If one were making a film , then getting such talents as Leon Shamroy as cinematographer , Lyle Wheeler as art director and Alfred Newman as composer of original music would guarantee a quality production . Add the cast of this film , including Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward as the title characters , James Robertson Justice , Raymond Massey , Kieron Moore , Jayne Meadows and John Sutton plus a dance by Gwen Verdon and expectations might be raised that the resulting film could be made into something special . But in a biblical subject script , usually a sub - genre prone to illogical motivations and miraculous interventions , everything would ultimately depend on the author 's skills . Philip Dunne here has supplied human beings , a rare achievement in biblical films . David is a man in this film , many - sided , not someone doing mythical deeds on paper in the Old Testament . Gregory Peck makes him curious , passionate , self - controlled , self - deprecating and appealing . As Bathsheba , Hayward is scarcely the perfect choice but conveys a good deal of common - sense earthiness and emotional normalcy that helps one see why the King of Israel would risk so much for her . The rest of the cast is stalwart and capable by turns . The familiar storyline provides them little to work with , but author Dunne and the cast do as much as is possible with the human situations . David 's youth is told in flashback ; how he was chosen by a Prophet of Yahweh to be King of Israel , and earns his way to be second to the king , Saul , by defeating Goliath the Phiiistine in battle when all else are afraid to beard the giant warrior . Thereafter , he finally is driven from the court of King Saul of Israel , becomes a famous warrior , and returns to claim the kingdom and become the instrument of death of Jonathan , the King 's son , formerly a friend . His wars are successful-- the film opens in fact with a successful attack scene ; but his life is empty since his wife Michal , Jayne Meadows , is Saul 's daughter and is cold to him . He turns to Bathsheba , whom he sees from the palace roof bathing naked ; later she admits she had hoped he would see her . But she has a husband , Uriah ; when she becomes pregnant , it becomes necessary for Uriah to come in from the battlefield and spend time at home ; he instead asks David to set him in the forefront of the battle , even after being aroused by Verdon 's dance . David agrees . He is killed , a war hero ; but this does not solve the infidelity question . Drought comes to Israel , and the king 's infidelity is blamed for the phenomenon . At last , David places his hands on the Ark of the Covenant , recently brought to Jerusalem and housed in a temple , which has caused the death of others who accidentally came in contact with it , inviting his god to punish him -- and nothing happens ... David exits the temple , and finds that rain has come to his parched land . This film is always interesting , varied in its types of scenes and physically beautiful . The director and author make use of the observer principle , and are frankly more successful in humanizing the characters than in almost any film outside the Grecianized- Near Eastern canon , wherein the feat is a bit easier since neither miraculous nor religious themes are made central in such adventures . . Well - remembered for its glowing realization , fine performances and intelligent dialogue , this dramatic effort bears repeated study .
neg	You know all those letters to " Father Christmas " and " Jesus " that are sent every year ? Well , it turns out that they are not actually delivered but dropped off in a half - forgotten corner of the post office to rot unless some bright spark figures out a way of posting them . As bizarre settings go , it 's a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is " Dead Letter Office " . Having said that , this is obviously an Australian film as opposed to a British one . If it was Royal Mail , most letters get this sort of treatment anyway . I have n't been in this flat for two years and we 're still getting letters for a Mr Wang , some female priest of the Church of Latter Day I've - Never - Heard - Of - You and various catalogues for industrial equipment addressed to a plumbing company . " Dead Letter Office " ( the name given to the place where undeliverable mail ends up ) follows the story of Alice ( Miranda Otto ) who grows up in a seriously divided home . Writing to her absent father , she only learns in adulthood that her letters have n't been delivered for one reason or another . So , logically , she gets a job at the D.L.O. and finds herself working alongside other social rejects including the brooding Chilean immigrant Frank Lopez ( George Del Hoyo ) . Slowly , she finds herself drawn to him but can she find out where her dad is without bringing the self - contained world of the Dead Letters Office to its knees ? Nothing against this film but I was reminded of the god - awful Heather Graham film " Committed " while watching this . However , this is so much better than that pile of horse crap but then again , that ai n't difficult . For a start , this film is much more logical . True , the metaphors are somewhat blatant and the underflowing symbolism quickly becomes a flood . But at least this is cohesive and quirky without being complete drivel . It is also well acted . Both Otto and Del Hoyo are very good as the lovers looking for something they know they 'll never find while other characters are peripheral at best . Part of the trouble is that it seems to wrap up far too quickly , leaving this viewer somewhat disappointed . The other part is that when you consider Australia 's draconian immigration policy ( i.e. if you do n't speak English , rack off ! ) , such a story is unlikely to take place in reality . The other characters , sadly , also help to destabilise the realism by proving to be little more than odd - ball stereotypes . Despite that , " Dead Letter Office " is certainly something a little different . It might not be to everyone 's taste but I liked it . Yes , it was hackneyed and predictable but sometimes , it 's nice to watch a film without guns or violence or heavy - duty swearing and nudity ( no chance of that in an Australian film ) . There ai n't any major laughs , there 's no Bullet Time and the characters are usually one - dimensional . But it 's the story that counts here and while it 's not earth - shattering in its magnificence , it 's a pleasant enough way of passing the time . It 's the movie equivalent of a Sheryl Crow CD - nice to listen to now and again but you would n't really miss it if it was n't there .
pos	This was one of the highlights of ST : TNG 's semi - forgettable second season , before they ' grew up ' or grew into their own in the third season and beyond . This was not only a showcase for up - and - comers like Bill Campbell and Teri Hatcher , but was also the continuation of Data 's search for his ' humanity ' , this time through the concept of comedy . Still one of my favorite episodes . On a side - note , I 'm still disappointed that there is no credit for the actress with whose character Okona was about to have a tryst(after Teri Hatcher 's character ) before being rudely interrupted by Lt Worf . I remember watching this episode ' first - run ' at my friends comic shop back in the day and we all thought she would 've been a perfect Jean Grey / Marvel Girl . It would be nice to know who this pretty lady actually is ...
neg	I just do n't get some of the big premises of this episode - that Miranda is so remarkable , and that there 's anything so ugly it would make you insane . Someone here made the remark that maybe it 's the frequency of the light waves or something rather than it being ugliness . Miranda is just a jerk . The episode is slow , inconsistent and way too talky . I also do n't quite understand why Kolos is an ambassador - why does n't the Federation just leave the damn Medusans be ? There 's one part I do like , when Kolos is speaking through Spock about the loneliness of the human experience . Overall , I love TOS and even at its lamest , I 'll always tune in . This episode though - mmm , I would n't purchase it except for a used copy under $ 3 .
pos	Ever since I remember , I have loved airplanes and flying . I am now in college with a private pilot 's license and looking to become a commercial . I could never remember why I was so obsessed with the subject until I came across my old Tail Spin tapes in my basement at home and it hit me , this was it . My parents bought every single tape they had and this was the only show I would watch as a kid . I had the theme memorized as I grew up and I can still re - cite it today . It is absolutely amazing and I plan on buying the DVD 's soon ! It really is great for children and adults and is absolutely timeless . I can not get enough of this show .
neg	What a great word " re - imagining " is . Is n't that what they call Dawn of the Dead MMIV ( 2004 ) ? A clever word indeed - it disguises the term that everyone has grown to hate , " remake " that is , and makes it almost sound as if the process of making one was creative and involved the imagination . Well , damn , was I misled . At least I was seduced more by the thought of countless gore and unbridled violence than by the idea of " re - imagining , " though it played a role . Still , why make a remake ? Directors do it for only a few reasons really : to update a movie for a modern audience , or because they personally love the original and want to make a tribute to it . An homage , if you will . Nonetheless , it all generally ( I do admit exceptions ) boils down to one thing : stealing someone 's idea and reshaping it ( or " re - imagining " it ) so that those who would never see it or understand it would pay money to see it . It 's like Coles'/Cliffs ' notes ; dump everything in a blender , purify all that is more puzzling and curious and throw in a few artificial flavors . In other words , a great marketing scheme . So what 's wrong with this one ? Well , I 'll start with what I liked . I liked the opening scenes . Thanks to CGI and a bigger budget we could actually get a grasp of the chaos of the zombie holocaust Romero tried to communicate in the original through minimalist means . We see the city in ruins , thousands of zombies : chaos and death . Two words that look beautiful on screen . Then it all falls apart . This set - up leads nowhere . The movie does what almost every remake does . It adds more of everything except character , atmosphere , and story . It 's noisier , ( in some sense ) bloodier , and more full of main characters who appear only to die in nonsensical subplots . The setting , the mall which played a crucial role in the original film 's story and theme , is purely coincidental . The idea communicated in Romero 's film , the pure ecstatic joy of having " a mall all to yourself as a fortress , " is gone here . Further , this " re - imagining " has no moxie , no spirit , no balls . It assumes ( probably quite rightly ) that the audience has no attention span and does n't bother to get us interested in the characters or the story . The film is rushed and misses the quieter interactions of the four characters of the original . You actually grew to care about those people in Romero 's version because there was a certain realism to their existence despite the insanity outside the mall . Here , you do n't care when or who goes : what matters is how they go . What else is their to say ? The film is not scary . It has one or two " jump " scenes and it tries to make up for the rest with gore and loud special effects . As a story it 's really too choppy to be followed and the conflicts between the characters are too underdeveloped to save it . The humor is also reduced to a few one - liners ( and one really good character : Andy ) . After that , what remains ? An ending that is plainly ridiculous and far inferior to the subdued , inevitable ambiguity of the original film . But , despite it being a pretty bad film ( though not quite as bad as some other remakes ) , it should be remembered for one thing : it kicked The Passion of Christ from it 's number one spot in the box office . Well done zombies .
pos	This was one of the first CREEPY movies I ever saw ... I was about 5 at the time . It scared me GOOD ! But that night I put chewing gum in one eye to be like the monster ... and my mom got very upset . She had to clean my eye with alcohol and the next day my eye smelled like DOUBLE MINT ! NOW THAT 'S A MOVIE ! Hey for it 's time it was a great movie . That Head sitting on the lab counter top was as real as it got back then . And IF your 5 it is VERY SCARY ! Kids now a days are spoiled by special effects that show too much and leave NOTHING for your minds imagination . Your mind can imagine things more scarier than special effects ! ( IMO )
neg	Inventor Wayne Szalinsky ( Rick Moranis ) is preparing to donate his problematic shrinking / expanding machine to the Smithsonian Institution as he and his wife Diane ( Eve Gordon ) get ready for a long weekend away from their son Adam ( Bug Hall ) . Wayne 's brother Gordon ( Stuart Pankin ) , his wife Patty ( Robin Bartlett ) , and his kids Jenny ( Allison Mack ) and Mitch ( Jake Richardson ) volunteer to look after Adam while his parents are away , but as luck would have it ( and the title would lead you to expect ) , the grown - ups are accidentally zapped by Wayne 's shrinking ray . As the kids run amok , their miniaturized folks must contend with monstrously huge insects , wrinkles in the carpet that look like canyons , and other threats to them . This was bad , like most straight to video sequels are , Honey , We Shrunk Ourselves was sort of laughable . I had to laugh at that movie " roach " Stuart Pankin and the party bullies were even more ridiculous , view at own risk !
pos	Pandro S. Berman was " In Charge of Production " but that made him the so - called Line Producer . But who produced this epic , filmed not in Arizona but in California 's Mohave Desert where scavengers have made off with all of the remnants of the " gold temple " , the Thuggee huts , the British outpost at Muri , the village of Tantrapur , etc . The minor technical faults can and must be forgiven . What 's unforgivable is the lack of an Oscar for best music , although maybe the Academy did n't offer such at the time . A single theme was played in various tempos including waltz , march and sweet , mood - setting . Brilliant ! One of the curious aspects of the production was the widow Kipling 's demands . An actor playing Kipling appears briefly before and after the battle scenes . In the initial release his scenes were cut , per Mrs. Kipling 's demands . Later they were included and lent a " connection " of Kipling 's immortal poem to Ben Hecht 's screenplay . Interestingly , this very typically and pro - British story was by a great screenwriter who himself hated the British .
neg	OK so I hear about this new Justin Timberlake movie coming out which features some pretty big names . I mean great actors like , The Freeman aka Morgan Freeman , an asset to Hollywood , however completely wasted in this film . Then we got Kevin Spacey , who I 've been a great fan of ever since I watched American Beauty and The Usual Suspects . Both of these great actors probably signed on to the movie thinking it was going to be a great movie as I did when I heard the story . Then enter a fresh faced Justin Timberlake . I say fresh faced because this is his first movie and those rotten tomatoes have n't hit him yet . Well the reason for that , I might add , is because no one will ever see this movie or even bother reading this review . The movie is so terrible that when i got into the first 15 minutes of it . The characters were so one dimensional that it makes some Bible characters look like the Don Corleone . They got the one liners and sound - bite worthy stuff . The token troubled black guy ( LL COOL J ) who is with a gorgeous woman who he otherwise would not even belong with in real life . The captain is this short whiny guy who speaks in such a high tone . And what crappy movie would be complete without the hero becoming richer because of an experience . Oh and lots of gun fire , i mean a whole lot . SPOILER(NOT ! ! ! ) THe kind of gun fire that leaves everyone in the police force who 's crooked dead and the hero prevails . They got flame throwers and rocket launchers , REally no kidding . Bottom line if you want to see Edison its because you are a great fan of one of the actors , or a great fan of Justin Timberlake , to all the 13 year old girls out there , enjoy ! ! I wish i had more hands , because then I would have more thumbs , because this movie is so terrible because then i could give it so many thumbs down that thumbs down would no longer mean anything because this movie is so terrible because it sucks so badly that it made me laugh out of frustration about the story line because it just would not end because the firing and yelling just kept happening . MAY G*D HAVE MERCY ON US ALL and save us from these terrible movies . Well it could be worst , another RNB terrible actor turned singer turned terrible actor is usher , hehe check out IN THE MIX lol , or even Get rich or die trying ' . Now the special thing about that movie is that its got 30 + year old men , playing 16 or even younger teens . I could go on with these .
pos	* * Possible Spoiler * * * Adam Sandler is usually typecast in Comedy , but in " Reign",gives a deeply moving performance . While there are people who showed Courage facing post September 11,2001,Sandler plays Fineman , a widower who is lonely and " lost in his own world".Johnson(Cheadle),a practicing dentist , encounters his old College buddy(Sandler)and wants to catch up on " Old times".We see , as in Rain Man(Dustin Hoffman),Fineman also gets emotional and withdrawn in stressful situations . Oldies music , appears to be a comfort and " Psychological " crutch for him to lean on . Johnson looks for , in Fineman , that certain pleasure and ease missing in his Family . He also feels unhappy and unsatisfied in his Job . In the same instance , He also wants to make sure his friend does not fall through the social " cracks".I came away from this movie , with a different outlook and more sympathetic Compassion for grieving families .
neg	A stupid rich guy circa about 1800 wants to visit a nearby mental asylum to see how a famous doctor cares for his patients . Despite an initially hostile response , he is soon cordially invited in and given a tour by the good doctor . And , as the doctor shows him about , he talks and talks and talks ! ! ! And as he talks , loonies run amok here and there doing nothing especially productive . While there is SOME action here and there ( and some of it quite disturbing ) , it 's amazing how dull and cerebral the whole thing is -- lacking life and energy , which is odd for a horror flick . Even a guy who thinks he 's a chicken and dresses like one becomes rather tiresome . The further this tour takes the guest , the more disturbing it becomes until ultimately you realize that the inmates have taken over the hospital and are torturing their keepers . Yet again , despite this twist , the film is amazingly lifeless in many places -- particularly when it moves very slowly as a bizarre ceremony is taking place or people are just wandering about the set . Only when the workers from the asylum found in a prison cell , starving , does the film have any real impact . Considering this plot , it sure is hard to imagine making it boring , but the people who made this cheap exploitational film have ! Now with the same plot and competent writing , acting and direction , this COULD have been an interesting and worthwhile film . You know , now that I think about it , this was the plot of one of the episodes of the original " Star Trek " TV show ! You know , the one with " Lord Garth -- Master of the Universe " and Kirk and Spock are held prisoner by this madman and his crazed followers . A final note : The film has quite a bit of nudity here and there and includes a rape scene , so be forewarned -- it 's not for kids . In fact , considering how worthless the film is , it is n't for anyone ! However , with the version included in the " 50 Movie Pack -- Chilling Classics " , the print is so incredibly bad that it 's hard to see all this flesh due to the print being so very dark .
pos	Manhattan apartment dwellers have to put up with all kinds of inconveniences . The worst one is the lack of closet space ! Some people who eat out all the time use their ranges and dishwashers as storage places because the closets are already full ! Melvin Frank and Norman Panama , a great comedy writing team from that era , saw the potential in Eric Hodgins novel , whose hero , Jim Blandings , ca n't stand the cramped apartment where he and his wife Muriel , and two daughters , must share . Jim Blandings , a Madison Ave . executive , has had it ! When he sees an ad for Connecticut living , he decides to take a look . Obviously , a first time owner , Jim is duped by the real estate man into buying the dilapidated house he is taken to inspect by an unscrupulous agent . This is only the beginning of his problems . Whatever could be wrong , goes wrong . The architect is asked to come out with a plan that does n't work for the new house , after the original one is razed . As one problem leads to another , more money is necessary , and whatever was going to be the original cost , ends up in an inflated price that Jim could not really afford . The film is fun because of the three principals in it . Cary Grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he was playing and makes the most out of Jim Blandings . Myrna Loy , was a delightful actress who was always effective playing opposite Mr. Grant . The third character , Bill Cole , an old boyfriend of Myrna , turned lawyer for the Blandings , is suave and debonair , the way Melvin Douglas portrayed him . One of the Blandings girls , Joan , is played by Sharyn Moffett , who bore an uncanny resemblance to Eva Marie Saint . The great Louise Beavers plays Gussie , but does n't have much to do . The film is lovingly photographed by James Wong Howe , who clearly knew what to do to make this film appear much better . The direction of H.C. Potter is light and he succeeded in this film that will delight fans of classic comedies .
neg	This movie really has no beginning or end . And it 's really VERY unbelievable . Mary - K and Ashley are supposed to be interns working in a mailing room for an Italian fashion company . But , for some reason , they 're put up in a 5-star hotel ( conveniently located across the street from the Coliseum ) , and all of the other interns they work with are just as abnormally model - looking as they are . One thing that I found obvious in this movie is the way that one of the twins DOESN'T end up with the guy . I guess they tried to twist their usual plot a bit . Nice try .
pos	This is a very well - made film , meticulously directed and with some excellent character acting that at times is deeply moving - for example the scene with the loyal but unsophisticated sidekick cop and his wife . The plot is convincingly worked out and exciting . The gangster character is particularly interesting and plays an almost metaphysical role in the life of the hero . It 's made clear that the cops are just as rough and ready as the underworld characters . A couple of slight reservations : I found the ending slightly one - sided as it celebrates the hero 's successful integration into the structure of the police and justice system , which collapses the ambiguity of the police characters which has been maintained up to that point . Also I found the lead female character somewhat weak : little more than a catalyst for the salvation of the hero , all she seems to do is weep and swoon as the tough guys battle it out .
neg	There were some scary scenes , which I 've always liked more than straight out gore , but otherwise this movie was rather weak . THere were too many questions left unanswered , and when they tried to explain anything in the movie , it was still rather unclear . After watching this movie I still seemed lost in a lot of ways . It sort of reminded me of Silent Hill a few years back . That movie was also unsatisfying , but still better than this because it did try to work and the story did actually make sense . This one , not so much . The acting for the most part in the Abandoned was decent , but the movie dragged on an on , and never really gave any type of satisfying conclusion . Like I said above , there were some creepy scenes , but otherwise , this movie was a mess . Sorry , I ca n't recommend it .
pos	Story says that on that on December 28 , 1895 , a small group of thirty - three people was gathered at Paris 's Salon Indien Du Grand Café to witness the Cinématographe , a supposedly new invention that resulted from the work done by a couple of photographers named August and Louis Lumière . The small audience reunited that day ( some by invitation , most due to curiosity ) did n't really know what to expect from the show , and when a stationary photograph appeared projected on a screen , most thought that the Cinématographe was just another fancy devise to present slide - show projections . Until the photograph started to move . What those thirty - three people experienced in awe that cold day of December was the very first public screening of a moving picture being projected on a screen ; history was being written and cinema as we know it was born that day . Of the 10 short movies that were shown during that historic day , " La Sortie Des Usines Lumière " ( literally " Exiting the Lumière Factory " ) was the very first to be screened . The film shows the many workers of the Lumière factory as they walk through the gates of the factory , leaving the building at the end of a hard day of work . While a very basic " actuality film " ( movie depicting a real event ) , the movie took everyone in the audience by surprise , as their concept of moving pictures was limited to Edison 's " Peep Show " machines ( the Kinetoscope ) , the brothers ' invention was like nothing they had seen before and so the audience stood in awe , as the people and the horses moved across the screen . The idea was n't entirely new ( Le Prince shot the first movie as early as 1888 ) , but the way of showing the movie was simply revolutionary . " La Sortie Des Usines Lumière " would become the first in the long series of " actuality films " that the Lumière would produce over the years . This primitive form of documentary was the brothers ' favorite kind of film because they were more interested in the technological aspects of their invention than in the uses the Cinématographe could have . Despite the initial lack of enthusiasm , after the first showing the Cinématographe became a great success and " La Sortie Des Usines Lumière " quickly became an iconic image of that first screening . It definitely was n't the first movie the brothers shot that year , and it probably was n't the best of the 10 movies shown that day ( personally I think that " L ' Arroseur Arrosé " was the best of the 10 ) ; however , it is really meaningful that the very first movie was the opening of a pair of gates , as literally , this movie opened the gates to cinema as we know it . 8/10
neg	I think Phillip Kaufman read the cliff 's Notes version of the Kundera novel and then set about making this film . Okay , of course it wo n't have the punch of the original . Kundera 's novels are great because of his manipulation of the narrative concept , his ability to step in and out of stories he constructs . This film does not even try ! The one dream sequence of Tereza 's , so vital to the atmosphere of the book , is reworked and makes no sense whatsoever . Also , and this is perhaps a lesser point , Daniel Day - Lewis looks a lot like Ben Stiller in this ( I know it 's not really a valid complaint , but hey ) . A perfect example of the Hollywood - izing of otherwise fine literature .
pos	- SMALL SPOILER HEREIN ! -   When I looked at the votes for " Creep " today , I was surprised about so many IMDb - users rating this movie " 1 " . I am wondering : what do people expect of such kind of movie ? Are there so many people watching a movie without knowing anything about it ? " Creep " is a HORROR movie and it is a pretty good one ! This automatically means : it has a absurd story full of holes , outrageous hazards and simple one - side - characters . So why complain about it ? Just take some popcorn and coke , make yourself comfortable in your seat and then ... ... enjoy to be scared to death ! The first 60 minutes when there is almost nothing else than Kate and a lonely subway station are incredibly scaring . There is suspense and fear in every corner of the screen and you will give some jerks just because of a sudden sound of a blinking neon lamp in the back of you . ( In my opinion the sound editor did the best job in this movie . ) When Kate meet her pursuer the quality of the movie drops but it still does n't become a bad movie . The second part of the movie is not scary at all , but the gore effects are well done and the story is quite well developed . ( ... as long as you keep in mind that it is a horror movie you are watching and not the Discovery Channel ! ) So , if you want to make yourself a very , very scaring hour . Just watch the first hour of " Creep " and then leave the cinema or turn of your TV . You know the rest of the story anyway , do n't you ? The bad guy will die and Kate will be the only survivor . But even if you watch this movie up to its end , you will not be disappointed . ... and if you want to push anxiety to the next level , do what I did after watching this movie : leave the cinema by dark night , go to the next subway station and take the last train home ...
neg	This , and Immoral Tales , both left a bad taste in my mouth . It seems to me that Borowczyk is disgusted by sex , and these two films are cautionary tales about what will happen if you do have sex . As a film , it 's not very well done -- some of the acting is truly epically bad ( such as the " American " woman with the French accent ) . The young woman 's sudden flip - flop from being anxious about the marriage to being interested ( when it seems like it should have been the other way around ) , and the aunt 's sudden realization of the young man 's secret do n't make sense -- they 're not explained at all . I also did n't like how the daughter 's relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of her family 's perversion or predilection for bestiality . The central idea , the idea that there 's this " sexy beast , " if you will , that lives in the woods , could have been a foundation for a perverse but fun story , but instead is just used as a basis for a nasty , sex - negative , morality play .
pos	An enthralling , wonderful look at the films that inspired the excellent Martin Scorsese . Many of the films he speaks of are easy to relate to his works , particularly the earlier ones , the silent era . Very enjoyable despite being a bit long , I found this to be one of the best documentaries on film yet . Required viewing if you admire Martin Scorsese and his work .
neg	From the beginning of the movie I had a feeling like its a movie about another Jason 's from Friday the 13th . And It is ... Dispute that the movie starts interesting . But as the times goes by its just a pointless movie about muted , supernatural , silent serial killer . I mean he goes under the guy 's bed without making any sound , not seen by anyone . He was supposed to be blind after failed execution but he walks and kills people like he used to . I 'm tired of it . For me it 's all over the same thing . In another words - unreal . Too many mistakes and confusing information . Well scene with tide up woman looked impressive but just at first time :} For that and for intriguing intro 2 stars .
pos	Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give solid performances in this beautiful but empty film . The irony is that Dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life . Truly gorgeous cinematography and sets , and yes Dietrich 's bottomless trunk of clothes are also fabulous . She look great ; Boyer looks young and trim . Story of a woman seeking meaning and an ex - priest seeking life seems pretty stale , but set against such unreal sets and skies it somehow works , given the two stars , the terrific score by Max Steiner , and a good supporting cast . The film runs like 76 minutes and seems badly edited , plus certain characters just appear or disappear . Joseph Schildkraut is funny as the Arab guide , C. Aubrey Smith is the old priest , Lucile Watson the mother superior , Tilly Losch the dancer , John Carradine the diviner , and Basil Rathbone plays .... well I 'm not sure . He just rides in from the desert and spoils everything ! As others have noted , John Gilbert was slated to star with Dietrich . I ca n't help but think he would have been wonderful . The role of world - weary Boris would have suited the great Gilbert quite well . And after the success of Queen Christina ( with Garbo ) , his career might have gotten back on track . I ca n't think of any other 30s film Dietrich did in color . She looks great and wears some terrific clothes . My favorite is the Valentino as The Shiek - like outfit she wears by the pool . Certainly worth a look for the lush sets and color and the two great stars .
neg	This norwegian movie is so crap , the actors can not act cause they seems to be reading from a book and the story is so ( wannabe ) hollywood .. the only actor who did a ok job was Haavard Lilleheie .. 3/10 If you want a really good norwegian movie watch Buddy , great actors and a feelgood story 9/10
pos	Hmmmm , want a little romance with your mystery ? This has it . I think if the romance was ditched this would have made for a better movie . But how could the romance be ditched when the story 's borrowed from something called a Harlequin Romance novel , whatever the heck that is . Had the romance been ditched , the story might have been a little too weak . The mystery here was n't too bad , quite interesting but nothing on the level of Mission Impossible international espionage . Oh well . I thought Mel Harris was pretty good ; her short skirts , i think , added some sex appeal ... but this Rob Stewart guy probably could have been better cast , maybe with a more well known TV movie actor . The directing was decent and the writing could have been improved on - both could have been a little edgier , a little darker , more adventurous . One thing that was great about this was the use of real European locations . That could easily have been changed so this could have been filmed in Canada but they really were in magnificently beautiful places like Budapest . Possibly a drawback was the director and/or cinematographer 's choice to frame certain shots picture postcard perfect . Not good . Had this been a more dramatic motion picture shot for the big screen , picture postcard perfect scenes really need to take a backseat and just be a nice part of the background . This was just a tv - movie , though , so they had to add some Ummmph to the picture and some of that Ummmph came from the scenery . Overall , twasn't really a bad movie . I 'll tell you what , this was absolutely the best Canadian - Hungarian production I have ever seen ! ( and the only that i know of . ) I hereby proclaim this to be a mediocre made - for - tv movie , giving it a grade of C-
neg	I read some gushing reviews here on IMDb and thought I would give this movie a look . Disappointed . On the plus side the male leads are good , and some interesting photography but as a whole this movie fails to convince . Seems to be full of its ' own self indulgent importance in trying to say something meaningful but falls way short and all in all the picture is an unconvincing mess . It is one of those films classified as a film noir which can be defined as follows : " A film noir is marked by a mood of pessimism , fatalism , menace and cynical characters " . Well that is the story here : 3 losers stumble upon each other with their collective problems that include mental illness , alcoholism , laziness , indebtedness etc and together they conspire to kidnap a child and outwit each other . Would have been a much better movie if the story was confined more to the kidnap instead of the character failings of the kidnappers . I thought the female lead was way out of her depth and came across as an amateur actress . Whilst some good moments , I finished up feeling I had wasted my time . 4/10 .
pos	Tripping Over . I must say at first I was a little disappointed in the first few episodes , but having faith in the show , and Abe Forsythe 's unquestionable talent , I continued to watch . I can safely say I 'm now glad that I did . The story did develop quite well , and all the characters have a strong base , and most do n't have any information missing . The only thing I can fault in this production is the somewhat annoying voice and pronunciation possessed by the character Lizzie . Some good acting coupled with a stellar plot really gets this show over the line . Here 's to hoping for another season !
neg	Spoken like a true hard - boiled u'an gangsta . The story is no worse than any number of gangster flicks , but never ever confuse this movie with The Godfather I or II , or Goodfellas . It is not in the same league . But what makes the film periodically painful to watch is all these Italian Americans swaggering around dropping bad gangsta lines in an even worse fake u'an accent . Pacino would have been great if they could just have dubbed him . I was looking forward to see Abrahams and Loggia , but their steenky accents spoiled the fun . Ah well , the script ai n't too hot either . Don Corleone would have made this disappear five minutes after meeting him , smiling and patting him on the back all the while .
pos	Reportedy based on actual historical events , this disturbingly violent , bloody , and shocking period epic sustains viewer interest by creating a verisimilitude missing in the majority of films set in a remote era . Ms. Bolkan 's portrayal of the rebellious nun is a tour de force . Her gradual transformation in character from an obedient if unwilling complicitor in social injustices of her day is adeptly evidenced by telling sequences : her witnessing of the hated local Duke 's casual rapist activity , her forbidden love affair with a Jew , her criminal defection to the invading Moslem forces of the sensual Prince Ahmed ( Anthony Corlan ) There are some painfully realistic gory sequences ( human flaying ) in this film that are not for the squeamish , but viewers with strong stomachs and an interest in medieval history should find ample interest . Deserves to be seen , if only as an antidote to Hollywood depictions of the medieval world .
neg	This film breeches the fine line between satire and silliness . While a bridge system that has no rules may promote marital harmony , it certainly ca n't promote winning bridge , so the satire did n't work for me . But there were some items I found enjoyable anyway , especially with the big bridge match between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk near the end of the film . It is treated like very much like a championship boxing match . Not only is the arena for the contest roped off in a square area like a boxing ring , there is a referee hovering between the contestants , and radio broadcaster Roscoe Karns delivers nonstop chatter on the happenings . At one point he even enumerates " One ... Two ... Three ... Four ... " as though a bid of four diamonds was a knockdown event . And people were glued to their radios for it all , a common event for championship boxing matches . That spoof worked very well indeed . Unfortunately , few of the actors provide the comedy needed to sustain the intended satire . Paul Lukas does n't have much of a flair for comedy and is miscast ; lovely Loretta Young and the usual comic Frank McHugh were n't given good enough lines ; Glenda Farrell has a nice comic turn as a forgetful blonde at the start of the film , but she practically disappears thereafter . What a waste of talent !
pos	Taking a break from his escapist run in the early ' 80s , Steven Spielberg directed Whoopi Goldberg in an adaptation of Alice Walker 's " The Color Purple " , about about the desperate existence of an African - American woman in the 1930s . Watching Goldberg play Celie , it 's incredible that this is the same woman who starred in movies like " Sister Act " . This is the sort of movie that could easily be - no , make that SHOULD BE - part of the curriculum in Black Studies and Women 's Studies . There 's one scene that may be the most magnificent editing job that 's ever been on screen ( you 'll know it when you see it ) . I ca n't believe that this did n't win a single Oscar ; it may be Spielberg 's second best movie behind " Schindler 's List " ( maybe even tied with it ) . Also starring Danny Glover , Adolph Caesar , Margaret Avery , Oprah Winfrey , Willard E. Pugh , Akosua Busia , and Laurence Fishburne .
neg	Evil Breed is a very strange slasher flick that is unfortunately no good . The beginning of the film seems promising but overall it 's a disaster . The dialogue is pretty bad but not near as bad as the acting . The acting is brutal and unbearable . Most of the characters deliver there lines horribly and even if that is on purpose the method does n't work because the characters become annoying . Some of the kills are innovative but it took far too long to get to them . After about a half hour through the movie we get the first death ( other than in the beginning)and then almost every other character is smoked within the next five minutes . The movie then turned into sort of a spoof with ridiculous looking characters , unrealistic karate like fights , and a scene in which a man gets his intestines pulled out of his a*sscrack . None of it is funny it 's just plain ridiculous . The film then becomes ultra gory and ultra pointless . Most of the characters are clichéd even for slasher standards and are as solid as butter left on the counter for 5 days . Evil Breed is n't even laughably bad therefore it fails in it 's main task . Watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre , Just Before Dawn , or See No Evil for a real slasher .
pos	Most of the feedback I 've heard concerning Meatball Machine has been pretty mixed . A couple even saying that they think " it sucked " . Well , to those people I say , get some f@ckin imagination and go f@ck yourself . This was a very entertaining flick . The story starts with this mechanical bug which attacks and somehow transforms its hosts into these Gwar - costume looking , deathbots called Necroborgs . Eventually you learn that these mechanical bugs also attach a little parasite onto you , which then is able to control your actions due to hot - wiring your nervous system . Unfortunately for two love - seeking lonely young adults , they happen to cross paths with the mechanical bug , and before you know it transformations are taking place and blood is being splattered . Is there a way to stop the transformation ? Maybe a way to stop this mechanical bug threat ? Why do the Necroborgs fight one another ? Do the two desperate singles get to express their feelings for one another and do the nasty ? Only one way to find out . Going into Meatball Machine I was kinda wary due to the mixed reactions , but it turned out being a great surprise . A few unanswered questions , some average acting at times and a slightly confusing ending are the only weak points I can think of . From the anime feel to it , to the parasites becoming little characters themselves and even to the low budget feel , this movie hits the right mark much more than it misses . With a ever - developing story that 's interesting enough to keep oneself asking questions throughout mixed with the cool make - up effects and blood splatter , this is one flick fans of bizarro / horror / Tetsuo / splatter fans should check out . 8 outta 10
neg	This movie is terrible . Carlitos Way(1993 ) is a great film . Goodgfellas it is n't but its one of the better crime films done . This movie should be considered closer to THE STING Part2 or maybe speed Zone . Remember those gems ! The only reason this movie was made was to capitalize on the cult following of the original . This movie lacked everything De Palma , Pacino and Penn worked so hard on . There was n't a likable character and that is the fault of everyone responsible for making it . I hope RISE TO POWER wins every RAZZIE it possibly can and maybe even invent some new categories to allow it be a record holder . After I watched this S@*T FEST movie , I sat down and watched the original Carlitos way to get th bad taste out of my mouth . After watching this I wish Pachanga came and whacked me out of my misery .
pos	I absolutely loved this movie . I bought it as soon as I could find a copy of it . This movie had so much emotion , and felt so real , I could really sympathize with the characters . Every time I watch it , the ending makes me cry . I can really identify with Busy Phillip 's character , and how I would feel if the same thing had happened to me . I think that all high schools should show this movie , maybe it will keep people from wanting to do the same thing . I recommend this movie to everybody and anybody . Especially those who have been affected by any school shooting . It truly is one of the greatest movies of all time .
neg	Due to budget cuts , Ethel Janowski ( again played by Priscilla Alden ) is released from a mental institution ( even though she killed six people ) and delivered to the Hope Bartholomew halfway house . Once there , she immediately relapses into her criminally insane ways and kills anyone who gets between her and her food . HOLY MOLY ! Does this movie suck ! You know you are in trouble when the open credits start up and they are just the credits from the first film , apparently filmed off a TV screen . Nick Millard ( under his pseudonym Nick Phillips ) decided to return to the world of Crazy Fat Ethel over ten years later and with a budget that probably covered the cost of a blank tape and a video camera rental for the weekend . Let 's just say that Millard 's unique style does n't translate well to video . Seriously , I have made home movies with more production value than this . And Millard tries to pull a SILENT NIGHT , DEADLY NIGHT 2 by padding half the running time with footage from the first film ( which looks like it was taken off a worn VHS copy ) . Alden is again good as Ethel but the film is so inept that you start to feel sorry for her for starring in this garbage . I mean , at least the first film tried . Here we have no music , weaker effects ( if that is at all possible ) , shaky camera work , horrible audio and editing that looks like it was done with two VCRs hooked up . Avoid this at all costs !
pos	Father of the pride is a pleasant surprise : It is funny , witty and features some great voice acting . The show is about the family of a Lion who is acting as the attraction of Siegfried & Roy shows . Indeed all of them are stereotypes but that 's what makes them so funny . FOTP is not a kiddie - cartoon it includes some crude adult humor but in a very mild way . It is full of popculture references and celebrity cameos and most of them are very well executed . I 'd say I 'll give the show a 7 out of ten because it is nice fairly well executed but not very original , I 've seen most of those stereotypes many times before , even in that particular order !
neg	I will never be a member of any club that would have me , especially this one . Starr Andreeff is a single mom / stripper who gets attacked by a female vampire and left for dead . She begins to get a hankering for blood , and meets up with John Savage , looking like he 's wondering where he left Michael Cimino 's phone number . Savage is also a vampire and wants to let Andreef join his little vampire family , which consists of a British vamp , the blonde vamp who attacked Starr , and a green haired midget ( I am not making this up ) . The family does not want Starr , so they try to kill Savage and Starr and Starr 's kid . Someone forgot to tell John Savage that this was a drama . He spends most of his screen time exhibiting more facial tics than Hugh Grant on a Jolt Cola bender , and he reads all of his lines like he is making a Farrelly Brothers film . Andreeff tries to make the most of a badly written role , but screenwriter / director Ruben goes for all the vampire cliches , like Starr eating her son 's pet hamster and buying a lot of raw meat to fight the craving for blood . The kid also gets knocked around a lot , for those who think watching violence against children is really entertaining . The film is extra gory , but not in a wild , over the top way like " Killer Tongue . " Here , the gore is gross and never justified , it just occurs . It is just in the budget . Most of the R rating goes to Andreeff 's coworkers , who are put through embarassing strip routines in the background of conversation scenes . The budget does not include vampire fangs ! All the vampires here must stab their prey to eat . Nifty idea , unless you have already seen George Romero 's " Martin . " Even at 77 minutes , and once you throw in Ruben 's attempts at arty direction ( skewed frames , blurred scenes ) , this is one tiresome , dull , and dirty ride . Leave this club and take a shower , you will need it . This is rated ( R ) for strong physical violence , gun violence , sexual violence , strong gore , strong profanity , female nudity , sexual references , drug abuse , and adult situations .
pos	Let 's set one thing straight : this movie does not seek to redefine the genre , it 's not Dr. Strangelove o Young Frankenstein . It 's a silly flick , with three great female leads ( ca n't remember any other comedy with similar characteristics ) , Rachel Dracht and Amy Poehler from SNL and indie queen Parker Posey , charming as ever . The story is basic : the three gals were " losers " in college , and are still after wards it . Poehler is a dog trainer ( who ca n't even get a date with a blind guy ) , Posey is an assistant for a senator ( who " has n't been touched by a man since Clinton was in office " ... i catched that one several minutes later ... i 'm a little slow , OK ! ) , and Dracht has a gay fiancée ( Seth Meyers from SNL , funny ) . They have to prevent the " uncool " daughter of the senator ( the always cute Amber Tamblyn from the TV series " Joan of Arcadia " ) to embarrass her during spring break . So of course they have to go to watch over her , and some hilarity ensues . All in all , a light , simple comedy , quite short , and quite enjoyable
neg	After eight Moto films the series had run its course , as this last entry demonstrates . Peter Lorre was clearly weary of trying to pump some sort of human interest and entertainment value into the wispy character of Moto , and the dreadful idea of pairing him with a " funny " British sidekick utterly defeats all his efforts here .
pos	This is one of Disney 's top five animated features , in my opinion . Cinderella was a perfect return to the full - length feature animation film ( as opposed to the compilation films of the 40 's ) , and expensive depth via the multi - plane camera returns to the film in no other way . Although Disney adapts the story somewhat liberally , you gather the idea of the era via the dress and set stylizations --- a clear time period the story takes place . Cinderella is more mature than Snow White , and a multi - dimensional character . Actually , all of the characters are somewhat well - developed , except for the Prince -- left the most flat -- we know he has a sense of humor , and a great smile , but that 's about all . Like Snow White , Disney has some permanent impact on the story in popular culture --- in most versions of Cinderella , the stepsisters are attractive , just not as pretty as Cinderella , and their character takes away from their otherwise nice appearance . Favorite Disney additions : the mice ! Also , appreciated the continuity -- Cinderella always loses her shoe throughout the film . The addition of the homemade gown as well as the following assault from the stepsisters was always horrific as a child -- I remember View Master showing this with a black background and a large red light on it ! The broken slipper shows the unwillingness of evil Lady Tremaine to give up her hold over Cinderella and admit defeat --- Audley would go on to characterize the most wicked of all Disney villains , satanic witch Maleficent , in Sleeping Beauty .
neg	* * SPOILERS * * This is one BAD movie . Seriously . Acting in absolutely horrible , the FX are dreadfull and the plot is down right awful . But hey , its so bad that its fun watching ! The script is SO bad that its enjoyable ! You just have to cringe and laugh at lines such as " I guess that s what you call CROCTEASING . " as the women flash their breasts at the crocodile . I mean COME ON that s funny cause its so bad ! It has such horrible jokes that they 're funny ! But after a while it just becomes to much as the movie turns into crap . I really started to fall asleep . Trust me though , the plastic croc foot stamping on the leaves and the constant swishes of a crock tail well keep you laughing for a long time . Though I have to say it had one cool part when the croc ripped that dude in half and he just hung there for a while figuring out what to do . Heh heh mindless movie , which HAS to be nominated for the MST3 K line ! !
pos	Jack Frost is about a serial killer who is sentenced to death . On the Way to his death sentence the prison truck that he rides in collides with a chemical tanker filled with a chemical that turns his molecules with the snow on the ground turning him into a snowman . Being a killer himself that would turn him into a killer snowman . Jack now wants revenge on the sheriff who caught him . Jack now starts his rampage all over again killing people in a small town . I do n't think Jack Frost has a chance of becoming a horror classic but its a entertaining flick . Just put your brain on hold and have fun with it , but just do n't take it too seriously .
neg	I guess I have still enough brain left to NOT find this movie funny . -Great comedians - but a very poor movie ! The " best " performance still did NINA HAGEN   TRIVIA : Did you realize that it the " real world " scenes ( in Hamburg ) the cars are almost ONLY new BMWs ? ?   I guess I have still enough brain left to NOT find this movie funny . -Great comedians - but a very poor movie !

pos	There are few comedies like this , where almost every line and every character come close to flawless . This is soooo funny ! ! And it has quite a bit of satire there to . Sally Field is heading the field of truly outstanding actors and does a good , if not perfect , job with her daytime tv - diva . Sometimes her acting is just a little to broad and over the top , but 90 % of the time she is a riot ! In the same league is Kevin Kline , Robert Downey Jr and Whoopy Goldberg ( who unfortunately has too little to do here ) . Downey jr may not convince entirely as a comedian and has not the timing right all the time , but he struggles with his part which is , to be honest , the most ungrateful one . But the shining star here is Cathy Moriarty as Celeste , a true bitch if there ever was one with more than one nasty secret ( you will see in the absolutely stunning finale ! ) . Sadly Elisabeth Shue never seems to be quite comfortable in her part . I normally like Ms Shue , but here she acts as a fish out of water and sometimes seems to be in a different movie . But it is not something damaging and for the most part she is at least adequate . Otherwise , brimming with memorable lines and situations , this is a comedy to watch whenever it is on TV or wherever .
neg	Visually stunning ? Most definitely . I have seen few films look this good in some time . Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow uses striking cinematography , computer graphics , and creative futuristic designs to create a world that is historically familiar yet something quite fresh . The time period seems to be the 1930s or early 40s . The movie tells of recent attacks on New York City by mechanized armies stealing generators and the like for some inexplicable reason . Also , mysterious disappearances of relevant scientific minds coincide . Who can stop them and save the world ? Alright , it does n't take a leap of faith to know it is the Sky Captain himself with his wisecracking reporter girlfriend always hot for a lead , and in the wings his trusty , thoroughly competent sidekick . What Sky Captain has in atmosphere and graphics it lacks in storytelling and characterization . The plot for this film is ridiculous . That being said , the film is going for a serial - like feeling of film serials of yesteryear . They had pretty far out stories and bad acting - but none of them , and I mean none of them , had the budget and big names this film had . Two academy award winning performers and Jude Law could keep a film afloat , one would think , but Sky Captain sinks miserably . Despite its fantastic dark look , I found myself wishing the film would just end and I could get on with my life . I had little interest in a story that generated little interest . I did n't care at all for any of the glib portrayals . Paltrow was just awful . Jolie was a joke with a role with virtually no substance . Law can not carry the one - liner tradition all too squarely on his limited shoulders . I mean , let 's face it , he 's not Will Smith , Mel Gibson , or even Wesley Snipes . The sad thing about Sky Captain , at least for me , was that it held so much promise yet delivered so little . I was bored ten minutes into the film - waiting for something to hook my interest - and it never came .
pos	I have bought the DVD of this version to compare against the current BBC 2005 version ( which is brilliant ) . The 1985 was adapted by Arthur Hopcraft , who adapted Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy for TV and who died this year ( 2005 ) . I remember great acting , especially from Rigg and Elliott , and moving music . ( Music in the 2005 version is far more understated , but very telling . ) Just to pick up other commentators on a couple of points : Richard Carstone is Ada Claire 's boyfriend , not Esther 's . Esther had no uncle . Charlie Drake never played Krook in either version , nor did he play Toby Esterhase in TTSS ! Krook is played by comedian Johnny Vegas in the 2005 version . Toby was played by Bernard Hepton . Both versions are honourable and admirable adaptations of Dickens ' great novel . Now read the book ! It 's not perfect , and the sentimentality may make you wince at times , but I defy you not to cry - and laugh !
neg	How can such good actors like Jean Rochefort and Carole Bouquet could have been involved in such a ... a ... well , such a thing ? I ca n't get it . It was awful , very baldy played ( but some of the few leading roles ) , the jokes are dumb and absolutely not funny ... I wo n't talk more about this movie , except for one little piece of advice : Do not go see it , it will be a waste of time and money .
pos	Visconti 's first film has all his trademark visual flair and immaculate technique , accompanied by compelling performances from Massimo Girotti as the handsome drifter and , best of all , Clara Calamai as the fabulous , frantic Giovanna . Remade several times as ' The Postman Rings Twice ' but never bettered . Ca n't believe this was the man 's first film ! It shows the confidence of someone at the zenith of their career .
neg	The movie is a total crap . We have two good actors who are miscast and a meat - head of an actor Salman Khan just to attract the female audience . The story is a crap . The characters poorly sketched . Non existent story telling . No editing to speak of . Ajay Devgan as a Rock Star .. that is a dream in itself . The movie drags along to the point of decadence . The whole charade about Arjun bringing his Manna to London , let him grope his girlfriend and let him not play at Wembley ( Vimbley in the dubbing process ) is absurd . Salman Khan 's over the top acting or faking is too painful to watch . I remember seeing some good movies from this Producer Vipul Shah but this is not one of them . It seems all the good directors are falling prey to the Box Office mania .. that the Mumbai Media Morons have created . This is yet another crap movie in the lines of " Wanted " with idiot actor like Salman Khan who has no place in a Good Hindi Cinema . He is good to the Indian Cinema as Titanic was to the Winter Cruise Business . On a positive note - I like Asin character dancing Bharatnatyam when she changes to the Western style dancing when the teacher is not looking .
pos	One piece of trivia that is often forgotten about this family film is one of business . At the time , in 1994 , this movie held the record for the biggest movie premiere in motion picture history ( and may continue to hold ) . It was held in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania - no doubt in honor of the original film 's " Angels " who " haunted " the Pittsburgh Pirates . In this remake they " haunt " the California Angels . Anyway , the premiere was held at the long gone Three Rivers Stadium which was the home of the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Pittsburgh Steelers at the time ( the Pirates are now housed in PNC Park and the Steelers at Heinz Field ) . The premiere was held on a movie screen that was five stories in height inside the stadium and held ( and may even continue to hold ) the record for the largest movie premiere in history , shown to 60,000 fans . Danny Glover , Tony Danza and Christopher Lloyd were all in attendance to the admiration of thousands of sports fans .
neg	BEGIN SPOILER : Fitfully funny and memorable for Mr. Chong 's literal roach - smoking scene : Chong coolly mashes a stray kitchen cockroach into his pipe 's bowl , lights up , coughs and hacks violently for a seeming eternity , then with perfect aplomb and not skipping a beat , re - loads the bowl properly , re - lights , re - tokes . END SPOILER . Alas , I began to lose faith less than half - way through the proceedings . It occurred to me that the lackadaisical duo are way obnoxious and less than relatable . I have come to appreciate the relative sophistication of contemporary stoners , Harold and Kumar . I simply prefer brighter company . Yet , the movie is probably a perfect fit for baked frat bros or those viewers who are so feeble - minded as to be outwitted by a stoner when they-- the former are sober . Notable guest appearance by Paul Reubens spouting obscenities in pre - Pee - wee form .
pos	Nagra comes from conservative Indian family that is n't exactly into girls playing competitive soccer . But our attractive young star CAN play some serious soccer . Rhys - Meyers coaches Nagra and encourages her to perform , while Knightley is supportive teammate and friend . When sis ' wedding is scheduled for the same day as the ultimate soccer match , what 's a girl to do ? Similar in its own unique way to BFGW as Nagra tries to push the envelope on traditional family ways . Here it 's dad ( well - played by Kher ) who can see both sides of the issue . Docked an entire point for a hokey late sexual preference non - crisis , if they needed filler they could have gone elsewhere . Nice final wrap up to the whole deal .
neg	The Good : I liked this movie because it was the first horror movie I 've seen in a long time that actually scared me . The acting was n't too bad , and the " Cupid " killer was believable and disturbing . The Bad : The story line and plot of this movie is incredibly weak . There just was n't much to it . The ways the killer killed his victims was very horrifying and disgusting . I do not recommend this movie to anyone who can not handle gore . Overall : A good scare , but a bad story . * * out of * * * * *
pos	Bela made 9 pics for Monogram , but it was only at THIS one , the 4TH , that things started to come together . All the rest in the series would use this one as the essential template for production , writing and character development . From here on , better or worse , the series would also deal with one essential theme : a scientist ( usually Bela ) makes experiments in the basement or the old house ( sometimes IN the basement in the old house ) that causes things to go blooey . This was also the first time that Art Director Dave Milton got a chance to spread his wings . He came on board for BLACK DRAGONS , the flick before , but THIS one is where he gets to make his craft start to click . Lewis made great atmosphere for next to nothing , and was around for all the rest of the Monograms . Casting is key in these , and it 's a pretty good one B movie wise , here . You get Barclay and Harlen ( also from BLACK DRAGONS),along with Russell , who would star in Lewtons ' CAT PEOPLE movies .. and Rosetto , from SPOOKS RUN WILD ... a nice slice of Poverty Row talent . If you have limited time and budget , start with this one ... it sums up everything they had learned up to this point , and gives you something to compare the rest to . The plot ? Bela steals gland juice to keep his nasty wife young . They both like to sleep in coffins . If you can read that and smile , the rest will be easy .
neg	Is there a movement more intolerant and more judgmental than the environmentalist movement ? To a budding young socialist joining the circus must seem as intimidating as joining a real circus . Even though such people normally outsource their brain to Hollywood for these important issues , the teachings of Hollywood can often seem fragmented and confusing . Fortunately Ed is here to teach neo - hippies in the art of envirojudgementalism . Here you 'll learn the art of wagging your finger in the face of anyone without losing your trademark smirk . You 'll learn how to shrug off logic and science with powerful arguments of fear . You 'll learn how to stop any human activity that does not interest you by labeling it as the gateway to planetary Armageddon . In addition to learning how to lie with a straight face you 'll also learn how to shrug off accusations that are deflected your way no matter how much of a hypocrite you are . You 'll be able to use as much energy as Al Gore yet while having people treat you as if you were Amish . In the second season was even more useful as we were able to visit other Hollywood Gods , holy be thy names , and audit - i.e. judge - their lifestyles . NOTE : This is the only time it 's appropriate for an envirofascist to judge another because it allows the victim the chance to buy up all sorts of expensive and trendy eco - toys so that they can wag their finger in other people 's faces . What does Ed have in store for us in season three ? Maybe he 'll teach us how to be judgmental while sleeping !
pos	First things first , this movie is achingly beautiful . A someone who works on 3D CG films as a lighter / compositor , the visuals blew me away . Every second I was stunned by what was on screen As for the story , well , it 's okay . It 's not going to set the world on fire , but if you like your futuristic Blade Runner - esquire tales ( and who does n't ? ) then you will be fine . I do have to say that I felt the voice acting was particularly bland and detracted from the movie as a whole . I saw it at the cinema in English , but I am hoping that there is a French version floating around somewhere . Definitely worth seeing .

Killing those who try to shut off his power , and unleashing his platoon of super - soldiers , led by the musclebound Romeo , SETH spares Deveraux , only because Deveraux has the secret code that is needed to deactivate a built - in program that will shut SETH down in a matter of hours . With the help of a hacker named Squid , SETH takes human form . Not only must Luc contend with ambitious reporter Erin , who wo n't leave his side , but Luc also must contend with General Radford , who wants to take extreme measures to stop SETH . SETH has also kidnapped Luc 's injured 13-year - old daughter Hillary , and is now holding her hostage . Luc is the only person who can rescue Hillary , because Luc knows firsthand how a UniSol thinks , feels , and fights . now there are problems like in any movie like did anyone find it weird how a reporter just - so - happened to be there and The soldiers can take being flattened with a truck however when Vanne Damme shoots them with a gun with one bullet and they die and the final fight scene was unbelievable when Luc is now human and Seth is 5x stronger and faster than any other Unisol and Luc can take a hit from him . with the final fight when Luc smashes him to pieces I was really surprised that the pieces did n't melt and reform him ( Terminator 2 ) . another thing that bugs me is how the hell does Vanne Damme get good actors to play relatives I mean in the case of Vanne Damme it 's completely off the grid of how Science Fiction this movie is . The Music Score now that must have a mention have you ever listened to a song where you 'd rather cut a blackboard with a knife well Universal Soldier 2 is like that . The good points are there 's no Dolph ( HOORAY ) and unlike the 1st one there is only one naked scene whereas in the 1st one there are many ( I 'm still haunted by the scenes in # 1 ) also the actors in this have some talent whereas in the first one the casting guys were sadists ( if you do n't believe me look it up )
pos	A beautiful postcard of New York . The thing I enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear . It never did . My teenagers liked it too . My son for Natasha Henstridge and my daughter for Michael Vartan . My wife and I commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and ALL enjoy something . This film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done . The ending came with a twist which we all liked too . If you are not just a cynical person and have are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you . As a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did . I recommend it and we need more of these films to watch .
neg	Unfortunately , this movie is so bad . The original Out of Towners was manic and very funny , of course they used the script written by Neil Simon . For some reason Neil Simons script is not used in this film so it falls flat time and time again . Even the audience I was with never laughed . The direction is very slow and tedious and when there is a joke it is given away so the joke dies i.e. The couple having sex in the park . They announce it is a lighting ceremony for New York , well we all know the lights are going to come on and we will be able to see cute and mugging Goldie & Steve do a bit of slap stick . The whole movie winds up being like this ... a joke is set up and given away . Why is n't Goldies hair ever even messed up in the movie . You will also notice every close up of Goldie ( they use a very intense soft lens ) . I suggest you rent the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis , that 's if you want to laugh .
pos	After you see Vertigo , then watch Bell , Book and Candle , made within months of each other . My second favorite Kim Novak film , with Picnic , coming in as third . All three performances are great , Vertigo , being the best , of all . They came to my nowhere Kansas Prairie town , near by , at Salina , Kansas in the 50s , to film , Picnic .   Bell , Book and Candle 's musical score , I believe is one of Alex North 's . Perfect for this bit of comedy . After Vertigo , Stewart and Novak , did this comedy , how amusing to note the dramatic contrast . Worth your time , if you like Kim Novak . The Greta Garbo of my youth .
neg	This is a wonderfully goofy example of a self produced , written and directed vanity project ... while I was working as a crew member John Carradine commented to me ( before the burning at the stake sequence ) : " This is the worst piece of sh*t I 've ever worked on ... and I 've worked on a lot of pieces of sh*t . " Also An interesting moment earlier when Jim Mitchum was having trouble with his lines and started cursing in the courtyard location of the Santuario ( a religious shrine in Chimayó ) - at which point one of the local " vato loco " low - rider onlookers growled " ... show some respect man " , which apparently caused Jim to remember where he was , as he then made a very profound and heartfelt apology for his inappropriate behavior . In any case the crew did the job on deferment and were never fully paid - but came away with plenty of particularly bizarre stories - like the night we caught the producer / director 's 10 year old son entertaining himself by constructing miniature Burmese tiger traps for us to break our legs in . Like they say : " Ya got ta ' love the Biz ... "
pos	I really enjoyed this drama from Sidney Lumet . The best word I could come up to describe it with is insane . It throws the viewer around for an hour and fifty minutes and does n't let you breathe until the credits start to roll at the very end . Trust me , this movie will keep you guessing the entire way through . The story is very well crafted and almost brilliant . It 's almost like a more complicated Tarantino type story . The acting is all amazing from all of the leads and even the small parts , excellent cast . I also loved the cinematography , it gave it the real feeling as if it were an independent film . It was all great . This movie is excited , exhausting and heartbreaking . It 's almost hard to watch but you 'll be glad that you did .
neg	This movie has beautiful scenery . Unfortunately it has no plot . In order to have a plot there must be a conflict . This movie had none . It spent two hours painting a beautifule scene and failed to ever place any activity in it . The picture trys to be artistic but fails to pay attentions to the fundamentals of story telling . If you love Montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just do n't expect a story . There is n't one .
pos	Disney have done it again . Brilliant the way Timone and Pumbaa are brought back to life yet again to tell us how they came to meet and help Simba when he needed them . I love this film and watch it over and over again . It shows how Timone lived with his family and fellow meerkats before setting off to find his dream home and adventure . Then he meets Pumbaa and things do change . Together , they search for the home Timon wants and repeatedly fail , which is funny as Timone gets more and more crazy . Then Simba turns up and we see more of his childhood than we did in the previous 2 films . The rest , you already know .
neg	A bunch of women who ca n't act sit around , talk , smoke pot . They have another woman in a wheelchair they hide because she is deformed , and occasionally they kill some one to feed this person human flesh that really looks like some store - bought ham which they dressed up by sticking on a few plastic fingers . We do n't see them killing anyone , suddenly there is a body on the floor , covered by a bloodied sheet . I ca n't eat Spam cover by a sheet anymore because of this . Just the thought of Spam cover by a sheet is enough to induce the same narcoleptic fit brought on by trying to get through all of this movie . Occasionally there are randomly inserted scenes of a guy who is " hunting " them by way of torturing some guy he strapped to a chair is his basement . Why he caught this guy and how he is connected to the Sit - On - The - Couch Sisters is never explained . There are also scenes of some " superhuman " guy freaking out . He p***es blood and punches through a wall , but who he is or what is wrong with him is neither explained nor even tied in to the story . There is no action , no special effects , no story . If you want to watch some boring people talk in a profound way about nothing while sitting around and eating ham and smoking , then here 's 90 minutes of that , because , except for a scene where one chick does some hooking on a street corner and the aformentioned random scenes , absolutely NOTHING happens . ( YAWN ) Oh , I almost forgot , you get to see them move some stuff , including the deformed sister , when they move to their new apartment . Its one of the few times they 're not sitting on a couch or lying in bed .
pos	Just came out of a sneak preview for this film . It had me laughing every 30 secs . The ending was so funny that tears were rolling down my face and it had me wishing I had n't bought that large coke . There are definitely some lulls , but , overall , highly entertaining . The movie lets Steve Carell have a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both Jim Carrey in " Bruce Almighty " and Will Ferrell " Anchorman : The Legend of Ron Burgendy " in their movies . Paul Rudd is hilarious as always . I love that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continues to work in indie dramas ( like P.S. ) . I think that Seth Rogen should be getting more work , because he so freaking talented and engaging . Leslie Mann also had some incredibly funny moments . I highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac . However , if you 're easily offended , do n't see this movie . If you 're a rabid feminist , do n't see this movie . And , please , not matter what , even if you think you 're one of those " hip " parents , do n't take your kids to this movie . Sure , you should let your teens go see this movie , just do n't watch it with them . It would make for some incredibly awkward moments .
neg	I 'm a big fan of the TV series Largo Winch . This movie was pain for me . I had to use fast forward not to fell to sleep . It was boring ! How can somebody ruin this title so much ? The story was the only good thing . Actors were sh.t . They ca n't live the role . The main actor(Tom ... ) is a null . Watch the other roles of this actor . The fighting scenes were unbelievable boring and not to followable , somehow they were not to follow the situation . Like other reviewer said low budget film with bad actors . Maybe next time somebody else can do better thing out of this title . French ca n't do right thing with big films , like Alien 4 . That was bit brrr , after Alien 1,2,3 .
pos	Being a big fan of the romantic comedy genre , and therefore having seen a large number of these films , it is rare that one strikes me as totally unique . For that matter , it is equally rare that I am gasping for breath through the laughter during several scenes . The love story is a little thin on the ground , but I 'd say that 's probably for the best , as this romantic comedy has the emphasis firmly on " comedy " , and in any case it stretches the bounds of credibility just a little more than I like most rom com 's to do . The four scientists provided some of the funniest moments not just in this film , but in any film I 've seen in a long while . I hesitated for the briefest of moments before finally choosing a " 10 " over a " 9 " as a rating , as I believe that far too many people use it indiscriminately , and therefore the maximum rating loses some of its impact . I 'm also a big Meg Ryan fan , which helps , but this is one of the few films I 've seen in which I 'd say she is comprehensively overshadowed . She and Tim Robbins are cast as the leads , but for me play second fiddle to the antics of the bumbling intellectuals . A genuine laugh - out - loud type film .
neg	Any movie that portrays the hard - working responsible husband as the person who has to change because of bored , cheating wife is an obvious result of 8 years of the Clinton era . It 's little wonder that this movie was written by a woman .
pos	Yes , as the other reviewers have already stated , this may not be vintage L&H but it 's far from being their worst work as at 20th Century Stupid ... I mean Fox . This film certainly has all of the basic ingredients for things to go wrong for the boys . But it 's their serious approach and determination that makes them funny . They do n't play it for laughs as other comedians might but they take their work and situation quite seriously and that is the essence of their eternal humor . In this film , they are faced with some basic issues that really might be encountered by any one of us today , namely job related stress . First , we would get checked out by a doctor and he would prescribe some much needed rest and perhaps staying by the sea . That 's where the surrealness comes in to all of this . L&H always take a most plausible set of circumstances and exaggerate it but never to the point of being incredible , except maybe once in awhile . This makes us laugh because we can relate to their self caused predicaments and attempts at extrication . That 's what makes Stan and Ollie universal in their appeal . In this film all those ingredients are presented in a delightfully artful and gracefully slapstick way . Not their best in comparison to their earlier work probably because this was the actual last film they did for Roach because he wanted to mirror the " big " studios and go into making features exclusively and also wanted to hurry up and finish their contractual obligation . BIG MISTAKE ! They should have all stayed together and continued for maybe five more years . What the world may have missed in their not considering this as an option . Watch , laugh , and enjoy this as their last great performance .
neg	This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen ! ! ! !   I can honestly say I have never seen a movie worse than this one ! ! ! AND I MEAN NEVER ! ! ! ! I 'm a BIG fan of " B " horror movies . As you may imagine .... I 've been exposed to some of worst that the movie industry has to offer . I was lured to this movie by it 's title . I mean c'mon ... what true fan of horror would n't be intrigued by a title like " Vampires vs. Zombies " ? ? ? Images of the " undead " battling each other to the " undeath " danced in my head . I thought to myself ... " this I 've got to see " ! ! ! ! Well .... sorry to say .... " this I wish I had n't seen " ! ! ! ! ! This movies title is very misleading to say the least . There was no vampires fighting zombies . In fact , there is no plot ! ! ! ! If you were to ask me what this movie is all about I could honestly tell you I have no idea ! ! ! There was no plot ! ! ! !   There was no story ! ! ! !   This movie absolutely makes no sense at all ! ! ! ! At the end of this debacle ... I found myself feeling sorry for the poor souls who had invested their money into this project for they surely have no business sense ! ! !
pos	I must admit I am a big fan of South Park and was expecting Basketball to be funny but nowhere near as good as it turned out to be ! I think this is what happens when you mix David Zucker , Matt Stone , and Trey Parker together . This movie has so much replay value and at no point bothers to take itself seriously . The slap stick style humor mixed with Stone and Parker just works flawlessly . The kind of humor present in Basketball was not popular upon the time of it 's release and had it come out today it would be a hit . Do n't bother trying to be critical , just leave your brain at the door and expect endless laughs to come . Recommended to anyone with a good sense of humor .
neg	I just watched this movie last night , and I HAD to put a warning out for anybody else considering to see this film . In a word - do n't . I seriously feel like this is something that a screenwriting student would have written in a Quentin Tarantino / Eddie Murphy phase , i.e. every other word was a curse word . I do n't have a problem with profuse cursing , as in " Good Will Hunting " , provided it helps to delve more into the characters . In this case it was just hollow banter with the attempt to draw an occassional * gasp * or laughter from the audience . The three lead characters are all their own unique stereotype , the wall street jerk , the coffee house jerk , and the " I'm - Not - Gay - Just - In - Touch - With - My - Feminine - Side " slightly - less - of - a - jerk . You just do n't give a damn about any of them ! They are all shallow , unredemable losers who you WANT to see lose . For those who dare , this film does have a couple funny moments , the very beginning , and the very end . The toilet / vibrator scene is funny in a sick kinda " Uh , yeah " way . Really though , I would only recommend this film to my worst of enemies .
pos	Joan Crawford had just begun her " working girl makes good " phase with the dynamic " Paid " ( 1930 ) . She had never attempted a role like that before and critics were impressed . So while other actresses were wondering why their careers were foundering ( because they were clinging to characters that had been the " in " thing a few years before but were now becoming passe ) Joan was listening to the public and securing her longevity as an actress . The depression was here and jazz age babies who survived on an endless round of parties were frowned upon . Of course , if you became rich through immoral means but suffered for it - that was alright . This film starts out with a spectacular house boat party . Bonnie Jordan ( Joan Crawford ) is the most popular girl there - especially when she suggests that everyone go swimming in their underwear ! ! ! However , when Bonnie 's father has a heart attack , because of loses on the stock market , both Bonnie and her brother , Rodney ( William Bakewell ) realise who their real friends are . After Bob Townsend ( Lester Vail - a poor man 's Johnny Mack Brown ) offers to do the " right thing " and marry her - they had just spent a night together when Bonnie declared ( with abandon ) that she wants love on approval - she starts to show some character by deciding to get a job . She finds a job at a newspaper and quickly impresses by her will to do well . Her working buddy is Bert Scranton ( Cliff Edwards ) and together they are given an assignment to write about the inside activities of the mob . Rodney also surprises her with the news that he also has a job . She is thrilled for him but soon realises it is bootlegging and he is mixed up with cold blooded killer , Jake Luva ( Clark Gable ) . Rodney witnesses a mass shooting and goes to pieces , " spilling the beans " to the first person he sees drinking at the bar - which happens to be Bert . He is then forced to kill Bert and after- wards he goes into hiding . The paper pulls out all stops in an effort to find Bert 's killer and sends Bonnie undercover as a dancer in one of Jake 's clubs . ( Joan does a very lively dance to " Accordian Joe " - much to Sylvie 's disgust ) . The film ends with a gun battle and as Rodney lies dying , Bonnie tearfully phones in her story . This is a super film with Crawford and Gable giving it their all . Natalie Moorehead , who as Sylvie shared a famous " cigarette scene " with Gable early in the film , was a stylish " other woman " who had her vogue in the early thirties . William Bakewell had a huge career ( he had started as a teenager in a Douglas Fairbanks film in the mid 20s ) . A lot of his roles though were weak , spineless characters . In this film he played the weak brother and was completely over - shadowed by Joan Crawford and the dynamic newcomer Clark Gable - maybe that was why he never became a star . Highly Recommended .
neg	Envy stars some of the best . Jack Black , Ben Stiller , Amy Poehler , and the great Christopher Walken . With such a cast , one can only expect the best . However , with " Envy " , no one could save this disaster . Tim Dingman ( Stiller ) and Nick Vanderpark ( Black ) are best friends and co - workers at a sandpaper factory . Both are making a decent living , but because Tim has a better performance at work , he 's able to afford more than his buddy Nick . Nick is a dreamer who 's always coming up with new ideas for inventions . One day , Nick comes up with the idea for a spray can that makes dog poop disappear ( Yes , I 'm serious ) . Falling in love with the idea , Nick decides to really invent this product . He makes an offer to Tim to invest in his idea and share the profits 50/50 . Tim refuses thinking the idea will never work . Nick 's invention , titled " va - poo - rize " ( again , i 'm serious ) , ends up making millions . He enjoys spending his money on things like a much larger house , a horse , a personal trainer , and fancy deserts . Tim starts feeling envy for Nick . Hence the name of the movie . The concept is n't bad , but it still turns out awful . This movie contains some of the worst dialog and very poor performances from all the cast . Then again , as I mentioned earlier , none of them could save this mess . Not even the great Christoper Walken , playing a homeless character named " J - man " , made this movie funny . The movie is bad from the start and only continues to get worse . I recommend this movie if : * you like crap ( no pun intended ) * you want to see Jack Black in a white tux I say , avoid this movie at all costs , but avoid ESPECIALLY if : * you 're offended by bathroom humor * you love animals
pos	Centered in the downtown and out skirts of Detroit , this comedy I found to be a terrific new comedic duo . ' Noriyuki Pat Morita ' is a very funny man , who happens to be a cop from Japan on the trail of an industrial secrets thief , who has stolen a ' proto type ' turbo super charger , reluctantly he goes to the United States to follow the thief , after being ordered by his commander . Pat 's character collides with ' Jay Leno 's ' character , a fast talking ' but down to business - player type Detroit cop . When they cross paths though , the honorable ' Ways ' of Japan meet the all - out old school Detroit police investigative ' Ways ' . The two stumble and trip over each other at first , but then develop a ' rythym ' that turns into an explosive two layered powerhouse team , that solves the case , cold . After battling a city crime boss for the stolen ' equiptment ' and closing the case , these two go from despising each other to being friends and working well together . A little worse for wear and in need of an extended - vacation on top of it all , they manage to come to a victorious closing . I rated this a 9 . Lewis 's direction makes ' this a near perfect comedy . Fun for all ages . I recommend it highly . ( * * * )
neg	When I saw this movie cover , the first thing I thought was that it was made for video . The second thing that came to mind was how similar this looked to another terrible movie " Darkness Falls " , the tale of this dumb witch who killed people in the dark . Unfortunately , Darkness Falls was quite the masterpiece compared to this pile of garbage , and this movie should not have been made . The film starts off with a small back story for the witch , or , more like a pointless introduction of two little kids who are going to go meet the tooth fairy in hopes of her giving them a shiny new bicycle for their tooth . The opening is filmed poorly , and like the rest of the movie , it 's certainly not scary . In present time , the movie is about Peter ( Lochlyn Munroe ) . Peter 's renting out his house , and his ex - girlfriend Darcy ( Chandra West ) , and her daughter Cole come to stay there . Cole meets a neighborhood child , and they talk of the Tooth Fairy , and how you should n't lose your tooth , or she 'll come for you . Unfortunately seconds later , it looks like the Tooth Fairy steals her bike and knocks her tooth out ( How ironic ) . Will Cole survive the wrath of the Tooth Fairy , and will her mother and Peter be able to save her , and rekindle their romance ... this is a bad movie , you could probably figure it out . One of the main problems with this idiotic film is how undefined the Tooth Fairy is . They say she kills you if you lose your tooth , but nope . She 's more like a serial killer who kills at random , and if you lose your tooth , you 're definitely going to go . She steals a bike , so apparently she 's a thief too . I said earlier that the idea for this movie was based on Darkness Falls , but where did they get the inspiration for the Tooth Fairy 's appearance ? Let 's see . She looks like a burn victim , and she previously went around the neighborhood slaughtering children . Hmmm ... it 's almost as though she 's an exact rip - off of Freddy Krueger from the " Nightmare on Elm Street " films . And this is not the worst part of this awful mess , the climax is . This movie might have the most laughable climax ( Not literally laughable because I found it more sickening than funny ) I 've ever seen . Do n't see this . Just a little trivia . Lochlyn Munroe was in Scary Movie , and Jianna Ballard was in Scary Movie 3 , and they both were in this , so apparently Scary Movie stars are forced to end out their career with bad scary movies . My rating : 1/2 out of * * * * . 80 mins . R for violence .
pos	This is the first 10 out of 10 that I 've given any movie . What made this movie so good for me ? Constant action - there is n't any slow parts , great acting , smart writing . I also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene . Finally , I get to see an action movie that does n't try to please all sectors of the public ( i.e. there 's no forced romance ) . I liked the first two Bourne movies , but I loved this one . Warning - after watching this movie , you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car !
neg	The plot is plausible but banal , i.e. , beautiful and neglected wife of wealthy and powerful man has a fling with a psychotic hunk , then tries to cover it up as the psycho stalks and blackmails her . But , what develops from there is stupefyingly illogical . Despite the resources that are available to the usual couple who has money and influence , our privileged hero and heroine appear to have only one domestic , their attorney and local police ( who say they can do nothing ) at their disposal while they grapple with suspense and terror . They have no private security staff ( only a fancy security system that they mishandle ) , household or grounds staff , chauffeurs , etc . Not even , apparently , the funds to hire private round - the - clock nurses to care for the hero when he suffers life - threatening injuries , leaving man and wife alone and vulnerable in their mansion . Our heroine is portrayed as having the brains of a doorknob and our hero , a tycoon , behaves in the most unlikely and irrational manner . The production is an insult to viewers who wasted their time with this drivel and a crime for having wasted the talents of veteran actors Oliva Hussey and Don Murray ( what were they thinking ? ) . And , shame on Lifetime TV for insulting the intelligence of its audience for this insipid offering .
pos	As much as the movie was good , i have nothing more to say about it than what was said already . all i wanted is to point the fact that the movie is nt from Sweden but from Denemark . Maybe I wrong and in that case i 'll be happy to know my mistakes so take the and notify me .
neg	This movie is phoniness incarnate , a straight 11 / 10 on the phoniness scale . The fakeness of the accents as well as the tightness of the cardigan spandex pants are just staggering . Yanks , although the real Scotland may be just as colourful , if you ever go there do n't expect to be given much of a the chance to " dance out " controversies with the locals . Also , do n't attempt to sway local opinion through the otherwise fine art of tapdancing . There are a couple of infectious singing - and - dancing scenes , but the plot is far too cheesy and linear , and the dialogue is often too weak . I also doubt whether anyone would want to be stuck in a timewarped 18.th-century Scottish village in the boondocks rather than gay New York City . Maybe it was n't such a big sacrifice for that priest to have left Brigadoon , maybe he was just trying to get the hell out of that dump . Watch it for the fine alternative - reality view of what a Christopher Streed Day - parade in Scotland would look like on LSD . Other than that I 'd only recommend it to Hollywood muscial completists .
pos	OK . Who brought the cheese . I love it . During it 's run it became a phenomenon . The Anorexic Twins became popular . Bob Saget started making a paycheck ( Instead of his REALLY funny stand - up ) . And people knew who Dave Coulier was . This is when life was good and simple . This is one of the great American classics . It was humorous and always brought home a good lesson . And this is where I differ from the norm : I liked the last few seasons . Like Home Improvement , when children get older there are a lot more you can do with the script . This is why I dare say ... It could have gone much later than it did . But anyway . I gave it an 8/10 because of its wholesome , funny story lines , and because of Bob Saget !
neg	On the face of it , Ruiz has set out to make a psychological thriller . Although it 's not as satisfying as a classic piece in that genre , there are compensations . The tensions generated between Huppert and Balibar as women calmly but calculatingly at war over a boy they both claim are compelling ; however , in a true European art - house style , Ruiz does n't give us release of this tension as the women alternately also try to behave compassionately towards each other . The only raised voice is that of Huppert 's waking from a nightmare ( an uncontested irrational event in the film ) . In fact , if we follow the title , the film is as little about its thriller skeleton as Jane Campion 's In The Cut . Instead it is an intergender psychological study focusing on men . The boy , Camille ( Nils Hugon ) , decides on a practical joke , playing his mother off against an emotionally vulnerable other woman . Both women seem to pander to him rather than scold and this compounds the problem . In the background is an intemperate psychologist ( Charles Berling ) , swift to confront the women in his life - his sister Huppert , the nanny or his pa - and so acting as a symbolic adult counterbalance to the , calm and ( we learn ) manipulative Camille . It is particularly interesting that , like the father in Henry James ' The Turn of The Screw , Denis Podalydes ' law - enforcer Father is absent for the duration of the film . Ruiz fashions an Oedipal moment out of Huppert 's reaction to his return at the film 's close . Read either as a thriller or as a psychiatric essay , this film is ultimately rather disappointing . I 'm officially rather fed up with Mme Huppert 's screen method , which is too buried and so I 'll be looking to see her on stage before I come back to her ( European - enjoyed Heaven 's Gate ) films again . The support is good . Ruiz does the cast no favours though . Quite apart from some poor lighting and some wilfully odd shots , its as if his direction has left characterisation quite out of reach - I 'm thinking particularly of Edith Scob 's Shamanic neighbour to Isabelle , who acts knowing but communicates bafflement . The set pieces do not link up to a forward driving plot - the tension I have already referred to is not only weakly dissipated but wasted in its directional potential . Want to see a good contemporary French thriller ? Go and see L'Appartement instead . 4/10
pos	Maybe one of the most entertaining Ninja - movies ever made . A hard - hitting action movie with lots of gore and slow motion ( eehaaa ! ) . Made in ´ 83 and still the greatest swedish action movie made so far ! And we can hardly wait to see the upcoming sequel , Ninja mission 2000 - The legacy of Markov !
neg	I wanted to vote zero or lower . I loved the commentary . It IS the worst movie ever made and ' unendurable ' is the perfect word for it , unless there is something worse that Roget never thought of . I am also at a loss to think of anything negative enough to accurately describe Bo Derek . The best that could be said of her is , she 's consistent .
pos	An American woman , her European husband and children return to her mother 's home in " Watch on the Rhine , " a 1943 film based on the play by Lillian Hellman , and starring Paul Lukas ( whom I believe is repeating his stage role here ) , Bette Davis , Lucile Watson , George Coulouris , Geraldine Fitzgerald , and Donald Woods . An anti - Fascist , a worker in the underground movement , many times injured , and wanted by the Nazis , Kurt Muller ( Lukas ) is in need of a long vacation on the estate of his wealthy mother - in - law . But he finds out that there is truly no escape as one of the houseguests ( Coulouris ) is suspicious as to his true identity and more than willing to sell him out . Great performances abound in this film , written very much to put forth Lillian Hellman 's liberal point of view . It was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time it was released , as the evils of war and what was happening to people in other countries reach into safe American homes . The movie 's big controversy today is that Paul Lukas won an Oscar over Humphrey Bogart in " Casablanca . " Humphrey Bogart was a wonderful screen presence and a fabulous Rick , but Lukas is transcendent as Kurt . The monologue he has about the need to kill is gut - wrenching , just to mention one scene . Though this is n't what one thinks of as a Bette Davis movie , she gives a masterful performance here as Kurt 's loyal and loving wife , Sara . Her acting tugs at the heart , and the love scenes between Kurt and Sara are beautiful and tender . The last half hour of the film had me in tears with the honesty of the emotions . Lillian Hellman is not everyone 's cup of tea , but unlike " The Little Foxes , " she has written some truly sympathetic , wonderful characters and a fine story given A casting and production values by Warner Brothers . Highly recommended .

And then , it 's up to Shahid to play the honourable lover and to embrace her unconditionally . Much in the same vein as Hum Aapke Hain Koun and Hum Saath Saath Hain , Barjatya 's new film Vivah too is on one level a family drama with an extremely idealistic premise . But sadly , the plot of this new film comes off looking way too outdated , even more far - fetched than those regressive Ekta Kapoor soaps . And the problem is clear  you just ca n't relate to such squeaky - clean characters who do n't have one bad bone in their bodies . There are many things that work in favour of and against Hindi films , and timing is one such important factor . Twenty - five years ago , perhaps the plot of Vivah may not have felt like such a stretch , but today it just seems like the product of a mind stuck in a time warp . Perhaps the film 's only saving grace is the fact that it oozes sincerity from start to finish , you can make out right away that the filmmaker 's intention is not to deceive . Judging both by Barjatya 's previous films and by closely examining this new one you can safely declare that Barjatya believes in a perfect world , he believes in his good - as - gold characters , he believes that large families can live together happily under the same roof without the slightest bumps . But alas , he 's unable to translate his vision to the screen . It 's difficult to overlook how one - dimensional his protagonists are  Shahid and Amrita , both virtuous and virginal  I mean , think about it , the first time they hold hands is an hour and twenty minutes into the film . Barjatya may think he 's returning to his Maine Pyar Kiya roots with Vivah , but truth is that the reason we embraced Salman and Bhagyashree in that film , or even Salman and Madhuri in Hum Aapke Hain Koun is because they had such fantastic chemistry . Because although they were created out of the same mould as Shahid and Amrita in Vivah , those pairs had mischief and masti . Shahid and Amrita are just insipid and boring . For a film that relies so heavily on music to narrate its story , the filmmaker chooses a string of 70s - style tunes that only further slacken the film 's deadening pace . But if I had to choose just one reason to explain why Vivah does n't work for me , it 's because I 'm not sure I can relate to any of the characters who inhabit Barjatya 's story . To some perhaps , Vivah will give hope , that a perfect world like this is actually out there somewhere . But I 'm a little cynical I guess . So , give me the coquettish Madhuri of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun , give me the bratty Salman of Maine Pyar Kiya , I 'll even take that mischievous Karisma Kapoor of Hum Saath Saath Hain . But save me from these dullards . You know , some marriages are n't made in heaven . This one 's Vivah !
pos	It 's hard to top this movie in several ways . Everything works really well here ; the casting , acting , script , and cinematography are all first - rate . For the moviegoer , it 's a moving , violent story of love and human redemption . For the film critic , there 's plenty of sharp technique and technical merit . There are some tactical blunders , and as has been discussed on the boards , the ending lacks realism if one is rigorously formal with the CIA agent training angle . However , I took the ending as being more moving due to the fact that rather than pursue the CIA agent 's pragmatic approach , Creasy basically commends his soul to the Ultimate without considering the consequences . Like Jesus Himself , Creasy becomes superhuman through his sacrifice , whether it actually makes pragmatic sense or not . In any case , I appreciated the fact that Creasy dispenses with conventional bourgeois morality and just caps the bad guys one by one in his methodical quest for justice , which actually results in redemption both for himself and the innocent .   In any case , this film is very much worth watching if you 're at all attracted to the genre . An excellent soundtrack , great writing , flawless casting , and solid performances across the board make this a top-100 ( or better ) film .
neg	I can not believe how bad this piece of garbage is ! I want my $ 3.99 back ! Words defy description of this poorly made piece of crap ! The dubbing in no way shape or form aligns with the actor 's mouths . The movie looks like it was filmed with a 1970 's vintage camcorder . I have shot better movies with my cell phone camera . The gore is laughable due to the silly unbelievable plot . The acting is what one would expect if you called all your friends over on a Saturday afternoon and proceeded to get completely ripped , then tried to put on a play in your garage . Do n't get me wrong ... I was n't expecting O'Neil and I love Zombie movies , but the production values are so low in this film as to make it unwatchable . Avoid !
pos	So you think a talking parrot is not your cup of tea huh ? Well , think again . Paulie is a wonderful film filled with touching moments . The characters are all lovable especially Paulie as he enters the lives of many people on his journey . It is journey worth experiencing . Do n't miss it ! It is available on home video .
neg	A Movie about a bunch of some kind of filmmakers , who want to make a documentary on a new kind of surfing in shark - infested waters . As an absolute fan of movies including some kind of vicious animals or monsters , I thought this might be my kind of movie ... it was n't ! ! ! This should be more of a guideline of how not to do it ! It has a lot of accidental humor in it and the evil beast is an incredible joke , in the final scene it goes after the main characters * rolling * , the feet are obviously waving in the air ! It looks ridiculous ! Good for a laugh though . If it were only for the lack of talent between the actors , the embarrassingly stupid dialogs and the hilariously stupid crocodile , it would be at least worth a laugh , but it gets worse : I 'd guess , the people in charge of this movie noticed how weak it was , so they though up the old idea of " sex sells " ... Totally , i mean TOTALLY without any reasons one of the main actresses shows her breasts to the beast . And somewhere towards the beginning there 's some kind of meaningless " makeout " . This is the last ingredient making the movie absolute trash to me . It 's incredible how people actually spend time producing such rubbish ! If you are seeking for a real waste of time : watch this movie ! ! !
pos	I can not stop saying how much I loved this movie . This movie is one of the least known and one of the funniest movies I have ever seen . The movie follows the exploits of a rap group , NWH ( Ni#$%rs with Hats ) It goes from the beginning of the group to the end of the group , after it 's tragic break up . Following the group is documentary maker Nina Blackburn .   The movie is on a shoestring budget , but it does not seem to matter , this is a very well made , well produced film and the performances by all of these actors and actresses are excellent . The main strength of this movie is the writing , there are so many brilliant lines and takeoffs on rap in this movie , it is unreal .   SPOILER There are takeoffs on actual rappers , like MC Slammer , Vanilla Sherbert , Ice Cold , Tone Def , Tastey - Taste , and songs ( Booty Juice , Grab Your Dick , Etc . ) Rusty Condieff has made an excellent film . In the movie he plays rapper Ice Cold . The movie does not quit , it is funny from the beginning to the end .   The movie works so well because it becomes outlandish on occasion , but it strikes that line where it is funny without going too far out there . Listening to the three leads try to talk some kind of philosophy was one of the best parts of the movie , like Tone Def telling a record producer , when you take the bus , you get there ' , and the producer responding , that 's deep ! ' The group portraying N.W.H. has some sort of natural chemistry to them . They work so well together , and they manage to pull this movie of to where there is not a week moment in the film . What really makes this movie so good is how true to some of the rap groups of the time this movie is . Many rap groups had problems with violence , with censors , and like NWA , the group only became popular when the establishment began to make a big deal out of the controversial lyrics . I like this movie because it is offensive . There is something here to offend everyone in a good natured way . The movie has a takeoff on a good number of people too outside of rap , the funniest being of Spike Lee . Where they came up with this dialogue I can not imagine . The movie has line after line that will have you rolling on the floor . As I said before the writing is just excellent . I am not surprised that this movie met such limited release . It is an intelligent , controversial , and even thought provoking film . This is too much for mainstream , despite the fact it is hilarious , and nearly flawless in it 's production . There are no major stars , but a lot of familiar faces , including Marc Lawrence , who plays Tone Def . Watch this movie , at the very least you will definitely have an opinion of it .
neg	The actors did a really good job playing their roles -- particularly the mom . However , as the movie progressed I found I was watching it more for their acting and not because I cared in the least for the people . And , at times , I felt irritated by the irresponsible and hands - off approach to parenting displayed again and again . The daughter is a 17 year - old shallow skank whose main ambition in life is bedding famous men and becoming a dancing nyphette ( complete with lots of " booty shaking " ) . The son is a guy with low self - esteem that seems very desperate for a relationship and friends -- so much that he throws a drug party late in the film . The husband and wife are both bored , but rather than put energy into their stale relationship would rather seek out new partners ( though the wife picks poorly , as the man she " throws herself at " happens to be gay --- OOPS ! ) . I just felt that ALL the characters needed to grow up and had a hard time caring for such shallow jerks . I think the author 's attempt was to demonstrate the utter banality and hollowness of the capitalist system . However , given that these characters are NOT typical of the average western family , it seems disingenuous .
pos	This is John Waters best film to date . The characters are obvious and symbolic , just as in his other films . So there are no surprises or character changes . I enjoyed the film because of the wittiness and pace of the story . It was good story - telling with honest people .
neg	I hate this movie . I hate the show . i hate just about everything about it . it 's so annoying and stupid . everyone 's saying that nat and alex wolff are heroes in the music world and that they 're going to make it big . WHAT KIND OF DRUGS ARE YOU TAKING ? ? ? ! ! ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! nat and alex are going to end up as either hobos or end up like Jane Hudson from " Whatever Happened to Baby Jane ? " . i could only get through not even 20 minutes of this one , barely 30 seconds of the show , and i managed to survive about half an hour of ' Battle of the Bands ' . How anyone could cheer for these guys in the audience at the Kid 's Choice Awards , i have no clue . days before the movie premiere on Nick , most of the teen girl actresses on Nick ( Jamie Spears , Emma Roberts , Lindsey Shaw , etc . ) showed up in a commercial influencing brain - dead kids about how awesome nat and alex wolff are . first off , they didn;t trick me , and second of all , nat and alex probably either drugged them or payed them loads of money in order to say that and sound convincing , because i do n't see how anyone could find this show / movie entertaining . the music is just awful . nat 's singing sounds like a sick , dying moose on crack . alex is the most annoying movie / TV show character EVER . he 's not funny , he 's annoying , he 's really weird , and he thinks he 's hot and knows everything about girls . this guy 's lucky if he ever manages to get laid . you know this show is fake when you find out that some of the characters ( in real life ) do n't even exist ! ! the character Jesse is actually played by Nat and Alex 's cousin jesse Draper ( they must ve had some budget problem ) . Their father is not single , he 's married to Polly Draper , but she does n't appear on the show , making it seem the Wolff 's are mom - less . Rosalina does n't exist either . Her name is Allie DiMeco . I 'll tell ya , the Naked Brothers are gon na be in some deep sh * * when their " fans " find out the whole thing is staged . 0/10
pos	ONCE UPON A TIME , there were different types of movies . These different movies coexisted even though each one had something different to offer .... This seems obvious at first , but I thought I 'd point it out during this review because it seems a few people may have forgotten . This is just a fun movie for Pavarotti fans . That 's all it is . It does n't claim to be anything else or anything grander . People who deride it as something that fell short of a promise are n't seeing the whole picture- literally . After all , Hollywood makes movies all the time that are shameless vehicles for people ( Bodyguard or The Preacher 's Wife w / Whitney Houston are 2 examples that spring to mind . ) First I 'd like to address the movie as a vehicle for Pavarotti . There are worse things in this world-- and worse movies . The singing is fabulous and the selection of arias is fun . The movie starts with Schubert 's Ave Maria and then Leoncavallo 's Matinatta . Pav sings arias from La Gioconda , Manon Lescaut , and Turandot but also sings popular music such as " I left my heart in San Francisco " and the song that was nominated for an Oscar & Golden Globe , " If we were in Love " w / music by John Williams & lyrics by Alan & Marilyn Bergman- all 3 previous Oscar winners . The story is n't that bad . It was built for Pavarotti so of course it 's not going to be something that 's profound or universally applicable to the average movie viewer . It 's a story of a famous opera singer who was traumatized by a bad night at the opera years ago . When asked to sing again at the same place , the " MET " in NYC , he loses his voice from fear . Doctor Pamela ( or Pah - MAY - lah in Italian : ) ) played by Kathryn Harrold- gives him a shot to cure his psychosomatic reaction . He offers her the chance to have a fling with him and she reluctantly accepts . They embark on an affair , she knowing he 's married & promising not to fall in love with him and him thinking she will be just another woman . Despite all that , they fall in love ( thus the song , " IF we were in love " ) and with her help , he overcomes his fear & goes back to the MET where he triumphs . I wo n't tell how it ends , but it 's fairly predictable . Which is n't always a bad thing .   The performances in this are n't that bad . Pavarotti ( who plays Giorgio Fini ) is n't an actor , so if you 're expecting a Spencer Tracy or Tom Hanks performance , YOU are deluded , not Pavarotti . He knows he 's not a thespian . What he is is cute , charming & charismatic . He is having fun himself , and if you can just let yourself have fun too , it 's not so bad . One funny line is when he tells Pamela ( Harrold ) that she 's a " thirsty plant , Fini can water you ! " and of course , she says , " I do n't want to be watered on by Fini ! " Kathryn Harrold is very sweet and does a nice job as a semi - uptight woman who learns from this extravagant man to live a little . One of my favorite lines in the movie is : " Life never has to be life size . " And there 's Eddie Albert who does his usual good job as Fini 's manager . There are several " themselves " cameos by real conductors , singers , etc . and it is filmed on location at the Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center .   If you like opera , if you like Pavarotti , or if you can just let yourself go & enjoy a " little fling " just like he proposes in the movie- then you can enjoy this movie for what it is . I know I do- EVERY time . :)
neg	Having seen the hot Eliza Dushku in the pretty good Wrong Turn , I decided to pick this one up instead of Return of the Living Dead , of all movies . Have n't seen that one yet , but , considering it is one of the most highly acclaimed horror movies ever , safe to say I made the wrong choice . There is simply nothing to recommend this movie , and I am talking about the supposedly superior killer cut . It did n't even have the youthful sex appeal of mediocre to poor movies like I Know What You Did Last Summer or Valentine or Urban Legend . It simply made no sense , held no excitement , had very little interesting acting or compelling writing . The release date was apparently put off numerous times for about a year running , and the reason is obvious . The whole movie comes off as a bunch of meaningless scenes thrown together haphazardly , to meaningless effect . Get Wrong Turn instead , if you want to see Dushku . I would like to see a movie with her and the super - hot Elisabeth Harnois -- but I do n't think even that would have made this movie watchable . Casey Affleck , so promising in Good Will Hunting , is awful here -- he seems to lack both intelligence and guts . That 's enough on this one .
pos	This afternoon we took the kids to the movies and saw Neil Gaimans Stardust and all I can say is Wow . It is rare that I am completely taken aback by anything but this is quite possibly the greatest fantasy movie I have ever seen , maybe even the best movie of any kind and it is all Neil Gaiman 's fault . Sure , I could have been sucked in by the wonderful dialog which was smart , flowed smoothly , and made the characters completely believable . I could go on for days about the spectacular acting , Charlie Cox is perfect as Tristan , Claire Daines is Brilliant as Yvaine , and Robert Di Nero almost steals the movie as the Deeply in the Closet Pirate Captian Shakespeare . The pure joy brought about by the humor which managed to be Laugh our Loud funny , Intelligent enough to make the first Shrek look like an 80 's Sitcom , and blend in perfectly with the rest of the movie alone would have made this a great movie . Special Effects were near perfect , true this was no LOTR or Star Wars SF Extravaganza but where they were use they were exactly what was called for , not too much to distract you from the movie itself and blended into the story perfectly . Then there is the story ? What can I say . How often do you come across a story containing all of the classic fairytale formula components that does n't just come off as another cheap Princess Bride knockoff . It manages to be Familiar and comfortable and yet completely new and refreshing at the same time . Any one of those things would have made this a good movie , all of them combined make it a great movie but they pale in comparison to the rich enchanting world that those elements combine to bring to life well . Once again Neil Gaiman has done it , he has driven another dagger into my heart by creating a world of fantasy that is so beautiful and enchanting that I would do almost anything to live in it and only given me a short glimpse into it . I did n't want it to end , I wanted to be sucked through a vortex to the land of Stormhold and get to meet Tristan and Yvaine in person , to travel it 's fields and valleys , Stroll through it 's marketplaces and meet it 's residents both dangerous and friendly and stay there forever . It is a feeling that I have noticed whenever I have read anything by Gaiman , The Sandman , American Gods , Coraline all left me with a deep sense of sadness when I finished reading them because it was over , I could not see anything more into the worlds he had created which seemed to be so much more vibrant and alive than the one I am forced to live in and watching Stardust was no different . In the end I 'm sure that Neil 's writing and this movie wo n't have the same effect on everyone but trust me when I say you will not regret the time or money spent watching this movie , it is easily one of the top 5 movies I have ever seen and I can guarantee that anyone at all with a soul will at least like it .
neg	I 'm starting to think that there 's a conspiracy , all right : one that involves a wallop of money paid to those who have access to published columns in newspapers and film and art magazines to ensure that this or that film , despite its obscurity , will reach a higher status via a ratings point which will tag it with a " universal acclaim " or something within that range , thus ensuring unsuspecting folk ( like me ) will wander into theatres or rent the bloody thing , expecting a surprise , only to find myself racing to the bathroom to upchuck . This movie is one of them . It has definitely make me bypass any and every posted article I come across because it 's rather clear that two things might have happened : either I did n't get the message that is so hidden beneath this film 's inner realms as to be impossible to access , or they and I watched two entirely different movies that happen to share the same name . 4 is a dirty trick on the audience . It 's no wonder that it appeared and disappeared faster than you can say " smorsgabord " and that despite the rating it got on Metacritic , no one had heard of it . It 's terrible with sugar on top . Firstly , there is the ever - present number four from start to finish . While having a little symbolism here and there is okay , and it 's been done with various degrees of success in many well - known movies , this movie is panting with it . Four dogs at the start of the movie , looking at the camera in a heretofore empty street when suddenly , machinery drops onto the foreground and proceeds to rip open the asphalt . Four people in a bar , although one of them is a non - entity . Three of them go their separate ways but are linked nevertheless , not only to each other but to what their lives are not . While this concept may work , the movie meanders so much -- particularly with the story of the would - be model played by Marina Vovchenko which goes into the territory of the extremely bizarre , and not in a good way -- that the initial theme gets lost in translation . Or maybe , like I said before , I just " did n't get it . " The problem also lies in that so much time is spent on Marina 's story ( which revolves on the death of her sister , from bread - chewing , no less , and the subsequent , shrill mourning which follows ) that any interest in the inherent Surrealism dissipates without a trace . So what if the same horrifying tales that the three strangers interchanged in a bar seem to have a truth of their own ? The director does n't invest much time in truly tying them together , or weaving a tighter story that could , in a David Lynchian way , intersect either with the past - present , or within alternate dimensions , or even as a straightforward , mundane science - fiction story . This is an uphill battle against an insurmountable wall that only a saint ( or someone into the weird for weird 's sake ) could endure .
pos	Farrah Fawcett is superb in this powerful 1986 drama , where she plays Marjorie , a woman who manages to escape the clutches of a would - be rapist . Well done to Farrah for being a Golden Globe ' Best Actress ' nominee . When her rapist Joe ( terrifically played by James Russo ) comes into her home , which she shares with her two roommates ( who are conveniently out ! ) , Marjorie has to play along with Joe 's frightening demands . It does make for some disturbing and shocking images ! When her roommates come home , they are astounded ( to say the least ) by Marjorie 's actions , and a great performance by Alfre Woodard who desperately tries to convince Marjorie to do the right thing and turn him into the police , makes the film even more nail - biting . I do find Diana Scarwid quite irritating , but when Joe finally admits that he came there to kill them all , it makes the film a very emotional piece of drama indeed . Overall , Extremities is a brilliantly thought - out and well - acted movie and I must have watched it hundreds of time by now ! Well done to everybody involved .
neg	Lynne Ramsey makes arresting images , and Samantha Morton can summon feeling with a gesture . So what a drag to discover their talents wasted on this mannered , pretentious lark .   Ramsey ca n't bring Callar to life . Her attempts are too arty and oblique . Repeatedly her camera lingers on long silent shots of the agonizing actress as if Morton 's obliterated gaze alone could supply character . We are in a blank Warholian hell of self - indulgence : for a film that has minutes to spare on bugs crawling across the floor , you might think it could get round to fleshing out its protagonist . But how will it do so if she rarely speaks ? Without the novel 's interior monologue , the celluloid Morvern Callar is nobody . Small wonder Ramsey has Morton undress often . That said , the first ten minutes were so impressively acted , shot and edited that my hopes were soaring . Give the film that much : it knows how to make promises , if not how to keep any .
pos	The premise is a bit better than the execution , but that does n't mean the film is worth a look . Splendid supporting cast makes this a fun mystery to unravel . Raines is great as the resourceful woman determined to solve this puzzlement . I always enjoy Thomas Gomez .
neg	Belmondo is a tough cop . He goes after a big - time drug dealer ( played by Henry Silva , normally a great villain - see " Sharky 's Machine " ; but here he is clearly dubbed , and because of that he lacks his usual charisma ) . He goes to the scuzziest places of Paris and Marseilles , asks for some names , beats up some people , gets the names , goes to more scuzzy places , asks for more names , beats up more people , etc . The whole movie is punch after punch after punch . It seems that the people who made it had no other ambition than to create the French equivalent of " Dirty Harry " . Belmondo , who was 50 here , does perform some good stunts at the beginning ; apart from those , " Le Marginal " is a violent , episodic , trite , shallow and forgettable cop movie . ( * 1/2 )
pos	Artistically speaking , this is a beautiful movie -- the cinematography , music and costumes are gorgeous . In fact , this movie is prettier than those directed by Akira Kurasawa himself . In this case , he only wrote the movie as it was made several years after his death . So , as far as the writing goes , the dialog was well - written and the story , at times , was interesting . However , the story was also rather depressing yet uninvolving in some ways -- after all , it 's the story of a group of women who work in a brothel . It 's interesting that although prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable business in Japan , the women STILL long for a better life . This reminds me a lot of the movie Streets Of Shame , though Streets Of Shame 's characters are a lot less likable and more one - dimensional . So , overall it gets a 7 - -mostly due to everything BUT the writing . It 's too bad that the weakest link in this movie is the story by the great Kurasawa .
neg	OMG this was the most painful experience of my life watching this . I could even finish it what is happening to Nick . Their best thing on teen Nick is Drake and Josh and that s about to go off air . The kids songs are kinda of annoying and the so are the kids . My little sister wanted to watch the show because she likes anything that comes on Disney or nick usually but after finish watching this show she said " one of the worst shows that I have ever saw so boring . " My little brother actually fell asleep I envy him . In short if your 3yrs old with no brain activity you 'll enjoy this show otherwise change the channel now .
pos	An unusual film from Ringo Lam and one that 's strangely under - appreciated . The mix of fantasy kung - fu with a more realistic depiction of swords and spears being driven thru bodies is startling especially during the first ten minutes . A horseback rider get chopped in two and his waist and legs keep riding the horse . Several horses get chopped up . It 's very unexpected . The story is very simple , Fong and his Shaolin brothers are captured by a crazed maniac general and imprisoned in the Red Lotus temple which seems to be more of a torture chamber then a temple . The General has a similarity to Kurtz in Apocalypse Now as he spouts warped philosophy and makes frightening paintings with human blood .   The production is very impressive and the setting is bleak . Blood is everywhere . The action is very well done and mostly coherent unlike many HK action scenes from the time . Sometimes the movie veers into absurdity or the effects are cheesy but it 's never bad enough to ruin the film .   Find this one , it 's one of the best HK kung fu films from the early nineties . Just remember it 's not child friendly .
neg	Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are a good match portraying vastly different siblings , but only Winningham is able to bring something convincing or substantial to her role . Leigh , playing bar - band singer and alcoholic Sadie Flood , constantly leans on older sis Georgia , an acclaimed folk singer in the Joni Mitchell mold . Perhaps due to her double duties as co - producer on the film , Leigh seems to have boxed herself into a corner : she is n't credible as a singer and , even if this is intentional , gives herself far too much screen - time at the microphone . Probably hoping for a tour - de - force , Leigh is wire - drawn and nervous and jagged ; however , we simply do not see any talent within this character ( Leigh is obviously a solid actress , but she makes decisions here that wall us off from her ) . If Sadie had even the slightest bit of charisma or appeal , we might be able to buy into the concept that she gets the ( small ) breaks that she does . As it is , the likelihood of her ever getting up on stage is slim . Director Ulu Grosbard crafts a few intense dramatic sequences , and the editing at the finale juxtaposes Sadie 's bar performance with Georgia 's sold - out arena show -- both singing the same song -- and it 's a sadly nuanced moment ... but really , what 's the point ? * 1/2 from * * * *
pos	Another Aussie masterpiece , this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural , and it does very well . It does n't resort to the big special effects overkill like American flicks , it focuses more on emotional impact . A relatively simple plot that Rebecca Gibney & Co. bring to life . It follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside , and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago . Strange things begin to happen in the house , and John Adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared , who was actually a mass murderer . Highly recommended . 8/10
neg	What exactly was going on during World War 11 in New Zealand when American forces were there ? This awful story of 4 sisters was really pathetic to view . Can you imagine casting Joan Fontaine as the older sister to Sandra Dee ? Fontaine looked more like her mother . Even funnier was that Fontaine becomes pregnant in the film . Piper Laurie and Paul Newman who showed such great on screen chemistry 4 years later in " The Hustler , " have no scenes together in this film . Laurie plays another sister who goes off to Wellington to tramp around there , despite the fact that she is married . Woe to her when her husband comes back from the war . Jean Simmons is widowed and finds romance with a much subdued Paul Newman . There is even romance for the young Miss Dee here . The picture has little to no meaning . Are they trying to say that all is fair in love and war ? If they are , they did a poor job in selling this . The conflict of interest with Newman and Simmons is quickly disposed of . That is what should have been quickly done to this terribly disappointing film of 1957 .
pos	While there are n't any talking animals , big lavish song production numbers , or villians with half white / half black hair ... it does have 1 thing ... realistic people acting normally in a strange circumstance , and Walt & Roy did in their eras with the studio . If you thought think " The Castaways " or " The Island At The Top Of The World " were n't identical , or you hold them to a higher authority than Atlantis , then your idealism is just as whacked as keeping your kids up till midnight to watch a friggin ' cartoon .
neg	Really it 's a dreadful cheat of a film . Its 70-minute running time is very well padded with stock footage . The rest are non descript exteriors and drab interiors scenes . The plot exposition is very poorly rendered . They are all just perfunctory scenes sort of strung together . There is no attempt at drama in scene selection but rather drama is communicated by the intensity of the actors . Please do n't ask . The plot concerns a rocket radiating a million degree heat orbiting earth five miles up threatening to destroy the earth . It 's a real time menace that must be diverted if a custom built H - bomb can be fashioned and placed in an experimental rocket within an hour . Nothing very much here to report except for a mad speech by a scientist against the project because there might be some sort of life aboard and think of the scientific possibilities but this speech made by the obligatory idiot liberal was pretty much passé by then . What saves this film , somewhat uniquely , IS the stock footage . I 've never seen a larger selection of fifties jet fighter aircraft in any other film . This is by no means a complete list but just some of the aircraft I managed to see . There 's a brief interception by a pilot flying , in alternate shots , an F-89 Scorpion and an F-86 . First to scramble interceptors is the Royal Canadian Air Force in Hawker Hunters and F-86 Sabre Jets ( or Canadian built CF-13s ) and even a pair of CF-100 Clunks . Then for some reason there are B-52s , B-47s and even B36s are seen taking off . More padding . " These Canadian jets are moving at 1200 miles an hour " . I do n't think so since one of them appears to be a WW2 era Gloster Meteor , the rest F-80s . The Meteors press the attack and one turns into a late F-84F with a flight of early straight wing F-84s attacking in formation . There 's a strange tandem cockpit version of the F-80 that does n't seem to be the T-33 training type but some sort of interim all - weather interceptor variant with radar in the nose . These are scrambled in a snowstorm . An angled deck aircraft carrier is seen from about 500 meters . It launches F-8U Crusaders , F-11F Tigers , A-5 Vigilantes and A-3 Skywarriors . The Air Force scrambles F-86s and F-84s and more F-89s then you 've ever seen in your life as well as F-100 Super Sabres and F-102 Delta Daggers . The F-100s press their attack with sooooo much padding . The F-89 's unload their rockets in their wingtip pods in slo mo . The F-86s fire , an F-102 lets loose a Falcon , even some F-80s ( F-94s ? ) with mid - wing rocket pods let loose . There is a very strange shot of a late model F-84 ( prototype ? ) with a straight wing early model F-85 above it in a turn , obviously a manufacturer 's ( Republic Aviation ) advertising film showing the differences between the old and the new improved models of the F-84 ThunderJet . How it strayed into here is anybodies guess . There is other great stock footage of Ottawa in the old days when the capital of Canada was a wide spot in the road and especially wonderful footage of New York City 's Times Square during one of the Civil Defense Drills in the early 50s .   I think we also have to deal with the notion that this was filmed in Canada with the possible exception of the auto chase seen late in the picture as the Pacific seems to be in the background . The use of a Jowett Jupiter is somewhat mind - boggling and there is a nice TR 3 to be seen also . Canada must have been cheap and it is rather gratuitously used a lot in the background . As far as the actual narrative of the film there is little to recommend it other than the mystery of just who Ellen Parker is giving the finger to at the end of the picture . And she most definitely is flipping someone off . Could it be , R as in Robert Loggia ? The director who dies before this film was released ? Her career as this was her last credit ? Its like the newspaper the gift came wrapped in was more valuable than the gift .
pos	Rupert Friend gives a performance , as Prince Albert , that lifts " The Young Victoria " to unexpected levels . He is superb . As we know , Queen Victoria fell into a dark , deep depression after Prince Albert 's death and looking into Ruper Friend 's eyes I understood . The film does n't take us to his death but to an incident that may very well could have cost his life . An act of love . I believed it , or I should say , him . I believed what he felt was real . Nothing or anybody gets anywhere near the delicacy and profundity of Friend 's characterization . Emily Blunt is good but I did n't believe for a minute she was Victoria . No real sense of period . It may no have been her fault but her prince deserved the crown .
neg	Some have praised -Atlantis :- The Lost Empire- as a Disney adventure for adults . I do n't think so -- at least not for thinking adults . This script suggests a beginning as a live - action movie , that struck someone as the type of crap you can not sell to adults anymore . The " crack staff " of many older adventure movies has been done well before , ( think The Dirty Dozen ) but -Atlantis- represents one of the worse films in that motif . The characters are weak . Even the background that each member trots out seems stock and awkward at best . An MD / Medicine Man , a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted sons , if we have not at least seen these before , we have seen mix - and - match quirks before . The story about how one companion , Vinny played by Don Novello ( Fr . Guido Sarducci ) , went from flower stores to demolitions totally unconvincing . Only the main character , Milo Thatch , a young Atlantis - obsessed academic voiced by Michael J. Fox , has any depth to him . Milo 's search for Atlantis continues that of his grandfather who raised him . The opening scene shows a much younger Milo giddily perched on a knee , as his grandfather places his pith helmet on his head . And while the characters were thin at best , the best part about -Atlantis- was the voice talent . Commander Rourke loses nothing being voiced by James Garner . Although Rourke is a pretty stock military type , Garner shows his ability to breath life into characters simply by his delivery . Garner 's vocal performance is the high point . I 'm sorry to say Leonard Nimoy 's Dying King is nothing more than obligatory . Additionally , Don Novello as the demolition expert , Vinny Santorini , was also notable for one or two well - done , funny lines -- but I 've always liked Father Guido Sarducci , anyway . Also well done was the Computer Animation . The BACKGROUND animation , that is . The character animation does nothing if not make already flat characters appear even flatter . Aside from landscapes , buildings and vehicles there is n't much to impress . The plot was the worst . Some say hackneyed or trite . I 'm not so sure about that . Any serviceable plot can be made into something new with the proper treatment . Shakespeare often started from a known story and plot and was famous only for putting on a new coat of paint . So the treatment is the thing . And -Atlantis- obviously lacks that . I can not begin to go into all the logic gaps without a spoiler section . The plot was bad . The plot 's bridges snap like twine and the ending does not make sense . To add to that , the script and the animation is peppered with annoying sloppiness . * * SPOILERS * * Right at the beginning when Milo reveals that runic or Celtic symbols have been wrongly transliterated and the " Coast of Ireland " should read the " Coast of Iceland " , we begin to have problems . The writers of the script would need to know the British take for Eire or Eireann as " Ireland " , and completely ignore the older , Latin term Hibernia . But more than this , they need to know of the Vikings conspiracy to call the greener island Iceland and the icier island Greenland . By making it the matter of a mis - tranliterated " letter " , the writers have doomed themselves to requiring a runic version of English and a post - Roman date on the script . Since this is long after Atlantis was supposed to have sunk into its undersea cave . And without visible clues and less technology than Milo had , made the inscription far less trustworthy . The Shepherd 's Journal could not be written before the sinking of Atlantis , or it would know nothing about the cave or the crystal lying " in the King 's eye " . It must have been written after the sinking , but without even the technology that Milo 's expedition had , how the heck did anybody get by the Leviathan . So how could it know more about anything after that ? And why would it be written in Atlantian ? Automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things . However clairvoyance and astral travel do not require to write in Atlantian . So it 's got to be some sort automatic writing . Since no - one left in Atlantis can read , it must be the spirits of the crystal beaming messages to the surface . This would have made more sense . But could also have been explained within the movie : Milo could shepherd have discovered that this power had been calling him all his life -- appeared in dreams , etc . This needed to be explored in the movie . The Atlantians should simply not be able to comprehend modern languages . No - one expects that the original Indo - Europeans would be able to converse in Europe , anymore than Romans would understand that hard " c"s or their day became French " ch"s ( pronounced like " sh"s , no less ! ) Current Atlantians were alive before the cataclysm -- when apparently they * could * read , yet now are unable to read what they used to , or operate similar machinery . The Mass Illiteracy points out a crucial flaw in the movie . NOTHING seems to have happened to this culture . It seems suspended in air until Milo can rescue it . Even though it appears that life is not a constant struggle for survival , no - one wants to compose poetry or write novels and perhaps it is a combination of Atlantian school systems going downhill toward the end and lack of good fiction that caused Atlantis to fall into illiteracy . Kida can be excused for not knowing how to read or operate the machinery if she was so young when the Cataclysm of Stupidity set in -- But ANY OF IT * * HARDLY * * qualifies her father for Deification ! ! Kashakim 's foolishness almost single - handedly wiped his people from existence . Killed a bunch in the cataclysm , stalled progress ( not a lot killed here , but he oversaw a massive slide in culture and progress ) until someone could take the crystal to kill everybody , if they were n't boiled in lava first because the Giant Robots were n't there to protect them . A bolt of blue electricity should have shattered Kashakim 's likeness , when Kida tried joining her father 's image to the circle of GREAT Kings of Atlantis ! Even though Milo was the only one who could read Atlantian , Rourke and others knew enough to look through a book of gibberish and find a page on a crystal -- which he knew to be a crystal and not some stylized astrological or " phases of the sun " diagram . If Milo 's grandfather had told Rourke about it , it still does not explain how Rourke would have suffered from Milo 's reading it as part of the book . Ripping out the page -- which was dog - eared in Rourke 's hand , even though Milo found NO sign of a torn page in the book apparently -- only was there to tip off the viewer that " something was not quite right " . Unless the word " crystal " would have set alarms off in Milo 's head that somebody would try to steal it , Milo would have suspected nothing . It 's just thick - headed foreshadowing . The crew 's " double - cross " was not a character change . We learned that Vinny , Sweet , Audrey and Cookie had been going along with Rourke from the beginning . However , the " change of heart " falls flat . It was a change , and needed to be better motivated . Hard to do with characters who were n't given anything to begin with . Niggling little bit that the lava flows up over the dome , instead of filling in the rest of the area that we view the sequence from . It 's liquid ; it will not flow over the protective dome until it fills up all lower areas . The ending STINKS!-- and makes no sense other than to appease political correctness . With it 's powersource restored , Atlantis is no longer a weak power , needing coddling . The giant robot guardians and the sky - cycles shooting blue lightning suggest that they have less to fear from us than they might . The technology is superior to ours , and definitely to early 20th - century . In the end Milo needs to teach the Atlantians to read , for what ? The whole idea is to leave their little quiet , chastened culture alone , not to send it into hyperdrive . * * END SPOILERS * * Perhaps , the Lost World plot and the turn - of - the - century setting should give me a hint that this is more an homage to pulps . The failures I find with the film agree with this idea . But I am at a loss why I should pay to see thin characters and plot holes simply because many dime novels had them as well . And pulp stories is part of the " crap they ca n't sell adults anymore " , anyway . We have become a bit more sophisticated and our pulp needs to grow up as well . Raiders of the Lost Ark lost none of its pulp feel and avoided so much badness . 4 out of 10 - -the movie is enjoyable but as I think about the plot , it seeps ever lower .
pos	I think I read this someplace : Joe Johnston ( director of the film and also one of the guys who founded Industrial Light and Magic for work on the first Star Wars film ) and one of his producers or something were racking their brains for a title for the movie , " Rocket Boys " ( I guess ) was lacking something . One day they were messing with a PC program that forms words from other words ( ie : you type in a word or series of words and it mixes the letters up and forms other words ) I think the technical term is an " anagram " Anyway , they typed in " Rocket Boys " and sure enough what comes back is " October Sky " . They were shocked to say the least . The title summed up everything in the movie since the movie revolves around Sputnik . At first Homer Jr did not like the idea , but he warmed up to it after the " movie poster paperback novel " came out and took off .
neg	This film ( along with Rinne ) are minor gems amongst the retread homage pics that have passed for horror movies so far at the 8FTDF " HorrorFest . " And , yes , that 's faint praise indeed . 'Cause there 's not much worse in filmdom than would - be auteurs who think atmosphere is a substitute for a coherent plot . And that 's all you get with The Abandoned . This is a film that was made almost entirely in the directors head . Sure , it would have been nice if he 'd transfered it to film , but this happened instead . It 's a very pretty film with a few genuine scares , but the last reel is strictly for the latte slurping cineaste crowd .
pos	One does n't get to enjoy this gem , the 1936 Invisible Ray , often . But no can forget it . The story is elegant . Karloff , austere and embittered in his Carpathian mountain retreat , is Janos Rukh , genius science who reads ancient beams of light to ascertain events in the great geological past  particularly the crash of a potent radioactive meteor in Africa . Joining him is the ever - elegant Lugosi ( as a rare hero ) , who studies " astro - chemistry . " Frances Drake is the lovely , underused young wife ; Frank Lawton the romantic temptation ; and the divine Violet Kemble Cooper is Mother Rukh , in a performance worthy of Maria Ospenskya . The story moves swiftly in bold episodes , with special effects that are still handsome . It also contains some wonderful lines . One Rukh restores his mother 's sight , he asks , " Mother , can you see , can you see ? " " Yes , I can see  more clearly than ever . And what I see frightens me . " Even better when mother Rukh says , " He broke the first law of science . " I am not alone among my acquaintance in having puzzled for many many years exactly what this first law of science is . This movie is definitely desert island material .
neg	The person who wrote the glowing review of this misguided project must be related to the writer / director / star -- or is , in fact , the same person as it defies rational thinking that this movie would be appealing to anyone not connected to a very tightly woven inner circle . How about this ? You want to make a movie -- tell a story ; entertain ; draw me in with vivid characters . Sure , you can do it artfully without bowing to the commercial elements designed for mass appeal . However , do not address elements of artistic expression in a vacuum in which the audience is in a continual struggle to grasp at skimpy narrative threads . If I 'm to be moved by a dreamy psychological thread then make the concrete fabric easier to buy .
pos	It was fabulous ! The photography , editing , cinematography , music combined to transport us to the dangerous side of a tourist destination . It was the enjoyment of " slumming , " without going through the danger . We were there ! The dream sequences and flashback - sequence - ending were fresh . It spoke to me . Keep up the good work ! Another of that genre is City of God . Also - do n't laugh ! - the comedy , Desperately Seeking Susan . Nice ensemble types , with great performances by all . Sorry , I think Training Day fits that genre as well , with fantastic performances by an ensemble cast . I had to switch the channel on some of the gritty sequences , but all - in - all , a great film !
neg	" Fever Pitch " is n't a bad film ; it 's a terrible film . Is it possible American movie audiences and critics are so numbed and lobotomized by the excrement that Hollywood churns out that they 'll praise to the skies even a mediocre film with barely any laughs ? That 's the only reason I can think of why this horrible romantic comedy ( and I use that term loosely because there 's nothing funny in this film ) is getting good reviews . I sat through this film stunned that screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel would even for an instant think their script was funny . The brilliant Nick Hornby usually translates well to film . He adapted " Fever Pitch " for a British film starring Colin Firth and Ruth Gemmell in 1997 ; Peter Hedges found Hornby 's voice for " About a Boy " ( 2002 ) and when " High Fidelity " was Americanized for a movie in 2000 , writers D.V. DeVincentis , Steve Pink , John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg did n't go wrong because they kept the essence of Hornby 's wit and humor . They made one of the best films of that year . So why does the American version of " Fever Pitch " go so painfully awry ? The British version was n't a masterpiece , but it was charming , funny , unexpected and gave us two characters we could like , respect and understand . But Ganz and Mandel have excised everything funny in Hornby 's work . In Americanizing the story , they 've butchered it , removing all that was good and unique about Hornby 's work and replacing it with conventional drivel . They 've transformed a funny story into a formulaic romantic comedy , never once veering from the wretched formula . Lindsey ( Drew Barrymore ) has three girlfriends , each of whom has a distinct function . One 's overweight , the second 's cynical and ambitious , and the third 's a romantic . Want to guess how many male friends Ben ( Jimmy Fallon ) has ? What made " High Fidelity " such fun was not only a good leading man and lady , but engaging supporting characters . In this " Fever Pitch , " the six supporting friends do or say nothing especially funny . They 're so insignificant , they 're not even decorative . The only reason they 're in the film is because the formula demands it . Poor Ione Skye winds up as one Lindsey 's pals in a thankless role . The lovely Skye must have been wishing Lloyd Dobler would swoop in and take her away . Come to think of it , Cusack would 've made an excellent Ben . Of course , Cusack is too smart to attach himself to such an utterly tedious script . There is n't a single , solitary moment in this film that seems original or unforced . Every plot turn is predictable , every lame joke telegraphed . Ganz and Mandel labor for laughs . The first 45 minutes are so excruciatingly slow , you wonder if these chaps realized they were writing a comedy . You can mark the plot turns in this film by your watch . It 's almost as if Ganz and Mandel penned this with some screen writing guru 's formula pasted on the wall . When they got to a certain page , they looked up at the formula and said , " OK , the guru says this has to happen now . " And , presto ! Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly do n't help the film any . They have no concept how to introduce their story and characters ( they hand over the V.O. narration not to the protagonist , but to another guy who sits behind Ben at Fenway Park ) . Thanks to some extremely clunky writing , we have to watch Barrymore and Fallon stumble through their unfunny initial meetings . Barrymore does cute and adorable better than most . She 's as good at it as Goldie Hawn in her heyday . But even her cuteness ca n't save this extraordinarily awful film . She tries hard to wring some energy and humor out of this story . About 30 minutes into the film , Lindsey tells Ben , " You 're funny . " The only explanation for her remark is that it was in the script . For Fallon 's Ben never says anything even remotely funny . Fallon is neither witty nor funny ; when he does comedy , he overacts . Fallon was never any good on " Saturday Night Live . " He was quite possibly the least funny person on that show . Remember that lame sketch about a radio DJ who did all the voices ? The only reason " Weekend Update " worked occasionally was because Fallon 's cohort , Tina Fey , knows a thing or two about comedy . Actors who think they 're funny and behave that way rarely , if ever , are actually funny . That 's true of Fallon . He thinks he 's hysterically funny when he barely raises a chuckle . His stuttering , unsure - of - himself shtick did n't work on the small screen ; it 's lousier on the big screen . Unfortunately for Fallon , his role in this picture also requires a few dramatic moments . If you thought his comedy was bad , wait till you get a load of his dramatic stuff . Two scenes in particular - the first in a park , the second in front of Ben 's school - are painful to watch . The scenes require an actor with a smidgen of dramatic ability , but Fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work . His range of emotions does n't even run the gamut from A to B. Ben has no personality or depth . Often , he comes across as an oaf . And not a lovable one at that . It boggles the mind what Lindsey would find attractive about him . Compare Fallon 's performance to Firth 's in the British version , and you 'll understand how terribly flat , unfunny and forced Fallon 's Ben is and how wrong he is for this role . Watching Fallon in " Fever Pitch " makes one long for the dramatic depth and comedic nuance of Ashton Kutcher ! Just as " High Fidelity " did , an Americanized " Fever Pitch " could 've worked brilliantly . It just needed better writers , more competent directors and , most definitely , a stronger , funnier , smarter leading man . Do yourself a huge favor : Avoid this rotten film ; rent the 1997 British version and read Hornby 's book , instead .
pos	Some spoilers If you are a big horror movie fan , then you will know that Halloween paved the way for many slasher films . Often imitated , never duplicated , this movie is a true horror classic and is definitely one of the scariest movies ever made , if not THE scariest . I actually saw this movie after seeing the rest of the series ( do n't ask me why ) . I honestly saw the other 7 movies before seeing this one , that 's just how it worked out . But I would have to say this one blows all the others away . It is genuinely frightening , and seeing Michael pop out from behind a bush or walk around in the dark sends a chill down your spine . My favorite part of the movie was when Michael stabs a guy , and leans his head to one side . It is one of the eeriest images in movie history . Later slashers , such as the Friday the 13th films , were more fun and less intense than this movie . I do like the F13 series better than the Halloween series , but this movie alone is better than all the F13 movies . Michael Myers is such a scary villain because he is realistic , you could imagine a crazed guy like him going around killing people . I admit this movie gave me nightmares after watching it for a few nights . What 's great about this movie is that it does n't rely on gore or humor to entertain the audience . It is just pure terror . It 's too bad the later films of the series swayed from this one , because this is as good of an example of a spectacular slasher movie as they come .
neg	A very bad attempt at a young spinal tap . At least the music in spinal tap was good . This is really a very sad case of Hollywood nepotism at it 's worst . A bunch of Hollywood execs , bad musicians and producers create some " poopie " show so their kids can be in the spotlight . Oh please ! ! ! The potty humor was even bad . I hate this stuff when there is really incredibly talented kids ( musicians , actors and artists ) out there busting their butts to have success and this crap comes along . Help u all ! ! ! ! Why was n't Gene Simmons in it ? ? ? Ameriac 's taste in entertainment is going down the toilet .
pos	This is unlike any other movie , the closest thing I can compare it to is a Woody Allen film ... But where as Woody Allen is constantly fathoming human foibles Bret Carr appears to be trying to figure out a way to get to grips with that one crippling insecurity that tends to define us for better or worse . In the Case of Lou , it is the root cause of his stuttering , which can be traced back to a singular child hood trauma that is revealed through flash backs . There are so many strangely neurotic people in the world and I believe they all deserve a chance for redemption , although diversity of human character is after all what makes the world such an intriguing place , so maybe we should n't fix our neurosis anymore than we should fix our noses or Breasts . This is an indie film shot on a long shoestring , but the production values are tremendous as is the scope of the film . I feel like its a quirky Gem for the self - help market . I really look forward to seeing what this filmmaker does next , i could imagine a career along the lines of Woody Allen or Albert Brooks , although usually when a guy like this breaks through , he goes off and makes " X MEN " and his humble quirky origins are soon forgotten or are they .... X Men is aout a bunch of freaks if i remember correctly :)
neg	I watched this movie really late last night and usually if it 's late then I 'm pretty forgiving of movies . Although I tried , I just could not stand this movie at all , it kept getting worse and worse as the movie went on . Although I know it 's suppose to be a comedy but I did n't find it very funny . It was also an especially unrealistic , and jaded portrayal of rural life . In case this is what any of you think country life is like , it 's definitely not . I do have to agree that some of the guy cast members were cute , but the french guy was really fake . I do have to agree that it tried to have a good lesson in the story , but overall my recommendation is that no one over 8 watch it , it 's just too annoying .
pos	The combination of the superb black and white photography and the ' Eugene Onegin with a twist ' plot made this a real knock out for me . The atmosphere created by the mostly very dark shots contrasted with occasional very bright overexposed white was gripping . There was a superb moment where where transparencies - apparently conventional holiday snaps but where the faces of the actors revealed character and situation subtly but instantly - were shown accompanied by Lensky 's heart - wrenching aria from the Tschaikowsky opera Eugene Onegin . For me the mark of a good film is that it should take advantage of the opportunities presented by that medium , which means that often the story is less important than imagery and atmosphere - Last Year in Marienbad is a good example of such a film . Krisana is in the same mould .
neg	" When a small Bavarian village is beset with a string of mysterious deaths , the local ( magistrate ) demands answers into ( sic ) the attacks . While the police detective refuses to believe the nonsense about vampires returning to the village , the local doctor treating the victims begins to suspect the truth about the crimes , " according to the DVD sleeve 's synopsis . An inappropriately titled , dramatically unsatisfying , vampire mystery . Curiously , the film 's second tier easily out - perform the film 's lackluster stars : stoic Lionel Atwill ( as Otto von Niemann ) , skeptical Melvyn Douglas ( as Karl Brettschneider ) , and pretty Fay Wray ( as Ruth Bertin ) . The much more enjoyable supporting cast includes bat - crazy Dwight Frye ( as Herman ) , hypochondriac Maude Eburne ( as Aunt Gussie Schnappmann ) , and suspicious George E. Stone ( as Kringen ) . Mr. Frye , Ms. Eburne , and Mr. Stone outperform admirably . Is there another movie ending with a mad rush to the bathroom ?   Magnesium sulfate   Epsom salts   it 's a laxative !   * * * * The Vampire Bat ( 1933 ) Frank Strayer ~ Dwight Frye , Melvyn Douglas , Maude Eburne
pos	This is a small film , few characters , theatrical . And yet it says something about Ireland that you wo n't find elsewhere . This film IS IRELAND . In all it 's grubiness , it 's sadness , it 's self - delusion . The Boys , Master Doyle , SP O'Donell , The Cannon , Senator Doogan 's daughter , Gar and above all Madge . I know them . I'm in the pub with them or kneeling to pray with them . They are our sad history and they are our present .
neg	This movie was poorly written , poorly acted and very predictable . It was very low - budget and I can understand why it was never released and went straight to video . It was n't even campy fun , it was just a complete disaster and I wish I could get the 1 - 1/2 hours back ! The colors were horrible along with the plot which has holes so big in it you could drive a mac truck through them .   The plot itself had the young bride doing things that she absolutely was not physically capable of doing -- what a stretch ! Skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre . Just about any movie comes to mind that is better than this . ejames6342
pos	This film appears to draw a borderline - on one side , those who love it , on the other , those who find it unbearable . To begin with , there is an awful lot of comedy in this film that many viewers are not " getting " . Of course jet Li 's Mask looks like Bruce Lee 's Kato - he 's supposed to , it 's a joke . The guy who has a time - bomb sewn to his heart - outrageous ? of course , it 's a joke ! Some readers will probably ask , if this film is supposed to be so funny , why all the excessive and gory violence ? well , for one thing the tolerance for this level of violence is actually different , from culture to culture ; and while Hong Kong audiences would recognize this violence is extreme , it 's certainly only slightly more than average for a HK action film . Also , Black Mask is really the kind of film that takes a genre 's conventions and pushes them to extremes , simply because the conventions themselves are wholly unrealistic . After decades of watching people get shot without any noticeable open wounds , many people were horrified to see Bonnie and Clyde and the outlaws of the Wild Bunch spurting blood all over the place . But the fact is , when you 're shot with rapid metal projectile , it 's almost certain that blood will spurt , especially from an artery . This film is a Chinese comic book movie . It is true that the Spiderman films never get this gory - but if they were faithful to reality , they would be ! Well , despite its comic - book origins , this film is faithful to reality . The only complaint I have is the flashy , over - stylized filming and editing . If the makers of this film had shot it with an eye to Hollywood - style nostalgia ( as , e.g. , The Rocketeer , or the recent Sky captain film ) , I doubt anyone would have found it offensive . But as it stands , I still had a lotta fun watching this movie .
neg	This obvious pilot for an unproduced TV series features young Canadian actress Shiri Appleby as an amnesiac with some pretty incredible powers that must be put to use when a man - turned - flying demon is let loose on the world . The CGI is par for a TV job , and Appleby is OK as an amnesiac but hard to swallow as a superheroine . Familiar TV face Richard Burgi is along for the ride as Appleby 's mentor , but he can do nothing to elevate this dreck above the mediocre level . We see way too much of the cartoonish flying demon right from the start , a bad sign . Also , the scenes where Burgi is training Appleby for battle are actually laughable . They are a bad copy of similar scenes in several other movies , most notably REMO WILLIAMS .
pos	I wo n't go into too much detail about the plot of this movie as other reviewers have covered pretty much the same ground . Just wanted to say that I really enjoyed the film very much . Peter Falk 's performance alone is reason enough to watch the film . A small scale ' road trip ' movie with Falk & Paul Reiser in upstate NY in the fall is the setting for most of the action in the film . Very well written with an adult target audience in mind . Plenty of reality based humor & some well played drama give the film a feeling that it could be your own family . Really ca n't say enough about this film except that it 's a damn shame that a lovely movie like this does n't get more exposure while other trashy junk out there does . It 's great to see Falk with a big leading man role again & he makes the most of it . It proves that his famous friend & writer / director John Casavettes was right in casting Falk in many of his ground breaking films of the 60s & 70s .
neg	Firstly , there are some good things about this film , but it 's all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie . In the advertising of this movie , that I 've seen , a large emphasis was on the fact that Denise Richards is in it , but she 's a poor actress , and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be ( not that that has anything to do with the movie ) . And what 's with that look she gives everyone ? Perhaps it 's part of the character , but like I said , the acting ... Still , the writing is fine . You know who it is all throughout the movie , and you can almost predict what is about to happen , but not in an irritating way . I think the book it 's based on is probably good , judging by the plot line , but next time I 'll read the book to find out rather than watch this .
pos	When i was told of this movie i thought it would be another chick flick . I was wrong . This movie sends a powerful message about judging others . I was deeply moved . Everyone i have encountered , I have recommended this movie to . No one has come back saying it was bad . Busy , also did a great job with her role in this film . I do n't know much about her acting career but wow , they way she pulled off the end of this fill was great . At the beginning it was a little slow . But after she went to the hospital .... wow , the movie picks up again . i have no idea why this movie has n't been spoken of in the movie world . My wish would be for this movie to be released again and advertised more ... because it sends a powerful message in a mere hour and a half .
neg	Truly shows that hype is not everything . Shows by and by what a crappy actor abhishek is and is only getting movies because of his dad and his wife . Amitabh as always is solid . Ajay Devgan as always is shitty and useless and the new guy is a joke . The leading lady is such a waste of an actor . Such pathetic movie from such a revered director and from such a big industry . With movies as such I have decreased the amount of bollywood movies I watch . RGV has been making very crappy movies for a while now . Time to get different actors . Hrithek anyone ? Bollywood needs Madhuri and Kajol back . Every other leading lady is a half - naked wanna be . Pffffft .
pos	I saw this movie in the theater when it came out . I grew up in Scottsdale and I went to Arizona State and really enjoyed seeing locations where I spent so much time . I remember at the time thinking that Barbara 's venture into more of a rock sound ( actually R and B - to my ears ) was a successful one . I was never a fan of Kris 's singing until his last effort for New West . As a songwriter and an actor , though , he has serious chops , IMHO . I think it is a fine romance . I like it better than the Judy Garland version and never saw Selznick 's Janet Gaynor original .   I do believe that they made some changes in this long - awaited DVD release . Among other things , I recall the helicopter shot which reveals a packed Sun Devil Stadium being longer and more dramatic . I wish they had done a better job writing music for Kris or God forbid , put some of his original songs in there .   Along those lines I have some information from a primary source that says that the music was a problem for Kris and Barbara . While doing interviews for my own new music documentary , Rocking the Boat : A Musical Conversation and Journey , I interviewed Stephen Bruton , a fine singer / songwriter / guitarist with close professional and personal ties to Kris , Bonnie Raitt , and Delbert McClinton , among many others . Stephen was in " Speedway , " the John Norman character 's band . Kris was having a real hard time turning what was essentially a pop score into something that could pass for rock . Stephen was and is Kris 's friend and long time band member . There was tension on the set and at one point the band was barking at Kris in Barbara 's presence . She remarked to the effect that the band should n't talk to him like that . Kris came right back to the effect that they were his friends and they WERE rock and roll ! In the end , Barbara came around and decided to use Kris 's band 's live performances in the movie and specifically sited Stephen 's role in making things work . I gained even greater respect for her as an artist upon hearing this story . Much is made of her as a diva . What she is is a pro . And I am not gay . Not that there is anything wrong with that .
neg	To be brutally honest ... I LOVED watching Severed . That 's why I gave it a 1/10 stars because of its starkly unimaginative story / filming / acting / everything . This film was a RIOT to watch . If you enjoy watching bad films in order to poke fun at them , you will really get a kick out of Severed . The story really does n't matter , it involves some guy who 's bald and has a sword and goes around beheading random people .   But he has a supernatural twist ... nobody ever sees him do it .   Even when , in one very memorable scene , he walks into a jampacked night club and whacks off some girl 's noodle and nobody sees it .   Severed does n't merely look like it was filmed on video- it WAS filmed on someone 's home camcorder . The filmmakers had knowledge of lighting ( very thin knowledge ) and composition actually holds together in some scenes . But mostly you ca n't hear the actors ... you ca n't understand what they 're doing , and you laugh when the next vicitm gets his pumpkin detatched from his body . Go and rent this movie . Support films like this- they are a hoot and a hollar !
pos	For someone who remembers Jane in the Daily Mirror strip cartoon , viewing this film is an exercise in nostalgia . In that context it is wonderful , but younger viewers would undoubtedly find the comedy limp and would miss the point that the actors are cartoon characters . The plotline is also a bit limp for today 's audience , but reflects the naivety of the 40s and 50s very well . Jane , you must remember , was part of the escapist fantasy of the wartime years , created to boost the morale of the troops . She gave a double meaning to the " strip " in strip cartoon . The story has something in common with the tales of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Rider Haggard . The theme would have been a familiar one to readers in that era , a bunch of bumbling Nazis thwarted by a few equally bumbling Englanders , and set in the African jungle of course . For Jane fans , a must see . For the rest of you , a damp squib .
neg	I came into this movie really wanting to line it . I thought the premise had a lot of potential and was ripe for an interesting movie . Do n't get me wrong here , I was n't expecting Citizen Kane , I was taking this for the B movie that it is . That said , it still fell short of the expectation . The historical aspect of the story is glazed over and the ending left me a bit cold . The acting in the movie was very wooden . All in all I give it 4 for a great idea , but the movie could have scored much higher with a bit more attention to movie making fundamentals . Is it worth seeing ? I did n't wish for my two hours back , but I do n't know that I 'd recommend it to others .
pos	Although Cameron Grant was clearly hired to replace Andrew Blake over at Ultimate Pictures when the latter started his own company ( Studio A ) , he practically outdid the " Master " right out of the gate when it came to setting up steamy sex scenes . So , while all the window dressing Blake had pioneered ( starlets in fetish lingerie and sun glasses , coiffed and made up as if they 're about to hit the catwalk ) remained very much present and accounted for , Grant added his own personal spin to the carnal content . In doing so , he raised the heat to a level that had eluded Big A ever since his first  and IMHO best  film NIGHT TRIPS . Cam 's maiden effort , ELEMENTS OF DESIRE , might still have been handicapped by an overly slavish adherence to the Blake aesthetic ( with a surfeit of girl on girl gropes ) , but his subsequent DINNER PARTY already shows him at the top of his form in what must surely rank as his masterpiece . The title spells out the premise as a group of well to do friends and acquaintances gather over dinner to swap sexy stories , with an extended orgy at the conclusion . Scrumptious Juli Ashton and Tammy Parks smear food stuff all over each other 's flawless physiques in their kitchen sequence that is sure to delight those with a taste towards combining pleasures of the palette with those of the flesh . Busty Crystal Gold ( here : " Catalina " ) was rarely more than a reliable second - stringer , adding spice to several Ona Zee bargain basement noirs , yet looks absolutely stunning here in a romantic four poster frolic with Fabio lookalike Vince Voyeur . Beautiful blondes Kylie Ireland and Yvonne , making out with Marc Davis ( for the record , the latter two were an item at the time ) under a waterfall , complete the eye candy section of the movie . Time to get cooking ! Early Jenna Jameson ( " Daisy " back then ) foreshadows the greatness to come as she drains Frank Towers ( " Mark Slade " on his subsequent shift to the gay side of the industry ) of all vital juices , albeit with a little help from brunette Diva for effective contrast , the scene 's stylish industrial setting providing an atmospheric backdrop to the full tilt sex taking place . Impossibly hunky construction worker Gerry Pike seeks to cool off on a sweltering summer day by hosing down , a prospect too tantalizing for prim ' n ' proper business woman Asia Carrera ( at her all time most achingly pretty ) to pass up . Best of show must be the imaginative sequence that has nasty Norma Jeane and handsome Sean Michaels teasing the pants off each other  for starters !  while separated by a glass partition right until the predictably splashy conclusion . With sex that proves either artsy or hot , and more often than not both , Grant has concocted a veritable smörgåsbord of fleshy wares to continue the film 's gastronomic analogy the title implies . Couples may be the prime intended audience , but an alternation between naughty ' n ' nice should rightfully include that " something for everything " recipe so many adult features are aiming for . Acting as his own DoP , the director shows great eye for detail , like the shot of Asia Carrera 's pristine white shoes being spattered with mud , enriching his vision . This marks him out as a great filmmaker rather than a merely serviceable one , as was the case with Nick Steele who stepped up to take his place at Ultimate  effectively making him a replacement 's replacement ?  when he packed up for greener pastures .
neg	OK , people , honestly ... this got ta be one of the worst movies about show biz that 's ever been made , but I 've been laughing myself silly ( which may be why I enjoyed it ) . Basically , it 's all about sex , sex and a way to get your own personal 15 minutes of fame . Did I mention that sex was a major issue in this movie ? If you have a thing going for bizzzzare characters and easy entertainment , watch this movie when you get the chance ( and do n't have something better to do ) .   * * * Attention spoilers ! ! ! * * * The funniest thing on the movie was the guy who asked Jerry whether he could marry his goat ( ! ) on the show and flashing his wallet with his love 's pictures . A triple A for bad taste and fun !
pos	The Ruth Snyder - Judd Gray murder in 1927 inspired Ogden Nash to write a Broadway play called Machinal . More famously , it inspired James M. Cain to write two short novels which anyone who has actually reached the point where they are reading this review would be familiar with - Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice . Both became film noir classics of the 1940 's , Double Indemnity being arguably the most perfect noir ever made . Some of the real - life elements of the Snyder - Gray story were captured by Cain - the old age and indifference of Albert Gray , Ruth 's high sex drive , Ruth and Judd 's passionate affair and complicity in the murder and that famous double indemnity insurance clause . Missing elements included the fact that the actual setting was a very urban Manhattan - Albert Snyder being a respected newspaper editor . The numerous incompetent and failed attempts were also ignored in order to cut to the chase . Cain 's Double Indemnity was filmed perfectly by Billy Wilder - let 's ignore Stanwyck 's ridiculous wig as one of those interesting accidents of film lore ! The Postman Always Rings Twice , however , was filmed thrice and Ossessione , an Italian version and Luchino Visconti 's first film , was the first of three versions . Before commenting on it , I 'll recommend the Lana Turner - John Garfield version of 1946 in its entirety and five minutes of the 1981 Jack Nicholson - Jessica Lange version for the great sex scene on the dining table . Ossessione is not as noirish as The Postman Always Rings Twice . It has a strong neo - realist look which makes it a great movie , but a lot of the essential noir elements are missing . It does not have low - key lighting and unconventional camera angles . The dialog is not hard - boiled and instead the film concentrates more on characterization . This is the longest version of the story and goes deeply into characterization . Its also a lot more sexual than the Lana Turner version . We have a very obvious adulterous relationship and Giovanna is very obviously a nymphomaniac . A new character is introduced into the story - La Spagnola - with very obvious homosexual overtones . There is also a small , but very well - played role for a dancer who moonlights as a prostitute . This is a far greater study of the working class than of crime . The audience really gets the feeling of poverty and grime . The drifter is a complete tramp , the wife is no Lana Turner and may even have been a prostitute before marriage . Her husband is an obscene capitalist - obese , rude and arrogant . I think the casting was brilliant for this film . My only beef is with the overlong running time . Everything is drawn out too long and it would have been more effective if it had been more economical . Nevertheless , fans of noir and realism will definitely like Ossessione , as I did .
neg	I am Puerto Rican and this is one of the worst documentary of I 've ever seen of any type . You can see that the people on it are clueless . They do n't know much about Puerto Rico and its culture . They claim to be Puerto Rican because they are from Puerto Rican descendants , but they probably know less than others who are not from there . You can see while they are talking that they are contradicting themselves . If you would like to see a real , and I mean a real , genuine documentary from Puerto Rico , then you must see " Mi Puerto Rico " . That 's a serious , real documentary . Not like this piece of junk . Rosie Perez based this documentary on herself . I thought it was suppose to be about Puerto Ricans . They keep repeating I did n't know . Well , that 's about the only thing they got right on this so called documentary . I hate to see such a piece of garbage being done using the name of the Island . It brings down the standards .
pos	Visual creative epic of inimitable style . This film may neither have the most alternative dramaturgy nor the most artistic acting . But who dares to say this film is no art ? I 'm not a supporter of the idea , that an important film must be serious , non - commercial or bothering me with questions . Even there are a lot of films , apposite to this attributes , that I like . Bogus Journey , for sure , is not one of this films . What you get is pure , excessive creativity with a very positive charged , childlike energy . This film does n't reflect reality . Its friendly - naive and utopian . Imagine the world of the future described by Rufus - for me it would be a pretty nice time - place combination to live in ! Except of that music ; - ) Technically , Bogus Jorney is very well made . I always liked the cinematography and the sceneries of this movie . Especially in this point Bogus Journey tops its prequel by far . Also the effects are good , and I think most of them very made without cgi . I generally prefer the good old effects in big budget movies . Sure its ' just another Hollywood movie ' out of some peoples view . But I think it is this in a very charismatic way . A short word to the soundtrack : all the band and orchestral music fits very well into the film . Also the sound design has no lack . I am not a big fan of rock music , but I had to get this track by Winger from the scene ' station ' builds the bill and ted robots in the van . I love the unorthodox camera work at its beginning . Let me conclude saying this : This film is very naive and very imaginative ! It is way better than Panzerkreuzer Potemkin , The Godfather , Eraserhead or Aguirre - the wrath of god . It is absolutely superior to citizen kane , apocalypse now or chris markers sans soleil ... ... it is even better than Total Recall ... No way ! ? Yes way ! Bill and Ted 's Bogus Journey is simply the best movie ever made . Who dares to disagree makes himself guilty of " artsie - fartsy behavior " or likes Terminator Salvation ( what is the bigger self - defamation ) PS : part 1 is not the better movie . So Bogus Jorney is a superior sequel . Not even Terminator 2 is a superior sequel ! Its NOT !
neg	I like Brad Pitt enormously . He is an actor with brains and wit , not to mention face , pectorals and all the rest . Since I saw him in " Thelma and Louise " a thought has been bothering me , who does he remind me of ? " Troy " did it for me . He is the new Brigitte Bardot . The differences are obvious of course . Male , American etc but Brigitte Bardot comes to mind nonetheless . He is so beautiful that he is at his most effective when he plays against it . " Kalifornia " " 12 Monkeys " " Fight Club " " Snatch " His self deprecating humor makes him human , almost accessible . Fortunately " Troy " will soon be forgotten . Only still photographs with Pitt , semi naked in ravishing sprint positions will decorate the walls of legions of salivating fans . Strange , " Das Boot " is one of the great films of the second part of the 20th Century . What is Wolfgang Petersen doing directing this ? Well , I suppose it would be very hard to say no at the chance of working with the new Brigitte Bardot .
pos	I have n't written a review on IMDb for the longest time , however , I felt myself compelled to write this ! When looking up this movie I found one particular review which urged people NOT to see this film . Do not pay any attention to this ignorant person ! NOTHING is a fantastic film , full of laughs and above all ... imagination ! Are n't you sick and tired of being force fed the same old cycle of bubble - gum trash movies ? Sometimes a film like NOTHING comes along and gives you something you have never seen before . I do n't even care if you dislike ( even hate ) the movie , but no one has a right to discredit the film . IMDb has a monumental impact on reputations and no negative review should discredit the film like that . Just say you hate it and why you hate it ... but do n't try to tell people that they should n't watch it . We have minds of our own and will make up our own minds thank you . If my judgment is any good , I 'd say that more people will enjoy this movie as opposed to those who hate it . Treat your mind to a bit of eye - candy ! See NOTHING !
neg	I watched this hoping to find out something I didn`t know about modern history`s most infamous man and couldn`t help thinking that history has been rewritten in HITLER : THE RISE OF EVIL . Hitler was so obsessed with his niece that he threatened to have one of her admirer`s shot . Hitler turned up with a gun in his hand to arrest Ernst Rohm . Forgive me for asking but haven`t the writers confused Adolph Hitler with Tony Montana from SCARFACE ? That`s bad enough but what really offended me was that there`s entire chunks of historical context missing in this mini series . Germany lost the first world war and the allied powers made Germany pay a heavy price for doing so . It was this economic environment that led the German people to have someone - anyone - to restore their pride and that`s why they turned to Nazism . The German humiliation of the 1920s caused by the allied powers seems to be entirely missing therefore there is no way that HITLER : THE RISE OF EVIL can be taken seriously as a historical document , and I haven`t even mentioned that Himmler and Goering are conspicous by their absence   There is one positive point about the mini series and that`s Robert Carlyle in the title role . Okay some of his mannerisms are wrong and his voice is a little too loud ( Archive recordings show that Hitler had a soft seductive voice ) but Carlyle is a charismatic actor and he does manage to communicate Hitler`s own charisma on screen . Comments in the British press that Carlyle resembles the synth player from Sparks more than Adolph Hitler are unfounded and he gives one of the better interpretations of Hitler . I liked the performance by Robert Carlyle but I hated everything else about this mini series and wondered why on earth it was made in the first place . There`s nothing to recommend it to serious history fans
pos	In April of 1965 , CBS broadcast the first of Barbra Streisand 's monumental television specials . The show was not only a runaway ratings success , but garnered 5 Emmy awards as well . This is one of the most memorable moments of 1960 's television and ( unfortunately ) the kind of television special they do n't produce anymore . Filled with wonderful songs and a spectacular performance by Barbra , this special is a must view for any Streisand fan and anyone interested in early television .
neg	May contain spoilers . I say that , but anyone savvy enough to be reading this can probably figure out every plot turn right from the start . This is not a movie that I liked . I did n't hate it in the way of some movies that insult your intelligence , but it all felt too predictable on its trudge to the requisite happy ending . There were funny bits along the way to be sure , but few were original . At least it did n't go for the gutter . Christina Applegate looks fresh , and Ben Affleck works hard . Their scenes together are actually the only redeeming feature . Everyone else is a cardboard cutout , including , surprisingly , James Gandolfini , who must have made this as a favor to someone . All in all , it 's a harmless , but not inspiring , 90 minutes .
pos	Tea Leoni plays Nora Wilde , a serious photographer , who is going through a bad divorce . She wants her freedom but it comes at a cost . She wants to legitimate photography but is hired to work for the tabloids as a paparazzi . Her boss is played by the wonderful and divine Holland Taylor . The show was well - written most of the time . TEa 's Nora was beginning to develop into quite a memorable character but the network just did n't support comedy and they still do n't . Even when they brought in George Wendt from Cheers , they made unnecessary changes in casting and characters . The show was fine in the beginning and the audience was getting used to it but then the network botches it up like a bad plastic surgery .
neg	I have seen a lot of movies ... this is the first one I ever walked out of the theater on . Do n't even bother renting it . This is about as boring a soap opera as one can see ... at least you do n't have to pay to watch a soap opera , though .
pos	Arthur is middle aged rich ' kid ' who drinks like a fish . Arthur does what he feels like and says whatever comes into his mind . He likes to boast about his riches and knows that he is a spoiled brat . He spends money on people he do n't know and finds everything funny . Arthur must marry a high class girl to inherit a big fortune but he falls in love with a poor waitress Liza Minnelli ( she looks really weird ) . This is a damn funny film . I watched this film because a very famous Indian film ' Sharabee ' is based on the character of Arthur . Although ' Sharabee ' is definitely inspired by ' Arthur ' I think they are two different films . ' Arthur ' is just fun . Its very corny at times . There are so many fantastic one liners in the film . Its not a laugh riot but it has some fantastic moments . My favorite scene is when Arthur meets his fiancé 's father and he keeps talking about the ' moose ' . Duddley Moore sure has some comic timing . He is very good with words and body language . I loved the scene where he talks standing to a seated couple in the hotel about a ' small ' country and he keeps talking to husband and wife in two different directions . John Gielgud got an Oscar for this film . I do n't know that actor . I do n't think he did a great job but may be if I watched more of his work I may agree in future . Movie has some flat patches but not very long ones . looking forward to watch the sequel .
neg	This is an interesting treatment of a subject that is quite controversial , ( just read the other comments on this film ) . Apparently , you either love it or hate it and it seems most people make that distinction based on whether they believe the tribulation and end times will happen as portrayed in the movie . Basically , the film - and its sequels - were made for about $ 1.30 each . The production values are right down there with " Plan 9 From Outer Space " and the acting is about on the same level as " Glen or Glenda " , ( my apologies to Ed Wood ) . Putting aside the religious message , the story is as scary as they come . Add in even the slightest thought that the story might actually be close to something that might happen in the future and it becomes even scarier . This movie , and its sequels , did n't try to bring in the reasons why the tribulation happened when it did . " Left Behind " and " The Omega Code " tried to get in everything " Thief " did and to explain all the politics and maneuvering in the Middle East leading up to it . The net effect was " Thief " did a much better job on the scary part of movie , instead of spreading itself too thin trying to explain what was happening in the Middle East at the same time .   Forget the politics and watch this movie , and its sequels , for what they are - horror stories . That they may be horror stories told , indirectly , by God makes them just that much more frightening . If it makes you think about the subject , it has done its job - even if you never believe .
pos	The sopranos was probably the last best show to air in the 90 's . its sad that its over , its was the best show on HBO if not on TV , not everything was spelled out for you throughout you had to think , it was brilliant . the cast was excellent . Tony ( James Gandolphini ) is a great actor and played his character excellent , as well as the others . Each character had flaws that s what made them so real and allowed the viewers to connect with them and that s one reason it lasted so long . The last episode was good , I 'm not sure how to take it many different things can be construed by the ending i d like to think that tony did n't die but meadow walked in and sat down with them and that the blackout was just for suspense . Tony will have to go to trial and deal with that hopefully is not dead that s how i feel ... Long live the Sopranos and Tony Soprano .......
neg	This is a big step down after the surprisingly enjoyable original . This sequel is n't nearly as fun as part one , and it instead spends too much time on plot development . Tim Thomerson is still the best thing about this series , but his wisecracking is toned down in this entry . The performances are all adequate , but this time the script lets us down . The action is merely routine and the plot is only mildly interesting , so I need lots of silly laughs in order to stay entertained during a " Trancers " movie . Unfortunately , the laughs are few and far between , and so , this film is watchable at best .
pos	This film is amazing - it 's just like a nightmare . The bizarre story , the dark decors , the swarming insects everywhere , the idea jumps and the surrealistic dreams ... Really great ! People who love cult movies or very dark thrillers will find this fantastic . It seems a little to the films of David Lynch : the strange story , the bizarre dreams , the red curtains . Nuit Noire contains almost no plot . It 's rather a succession of surrealistic happenings , nightmares and meetings . That 's a drawback . If the film had a really fascinating plot full of tension with a captivating denouement , I would give it a 10 out of 10 . But that 's missing , and that 's why I gave the movie an 8 . Nuit Noire is a film worth watching . Search that DVD and you 'll be rewarded !
neg	That 's what the title should be , anyway . This movie combines guns , explosives , and mindless killing to make one flop of an " action " movie . Let me make my point in a series of questions : answers type deal . What happens in the movie ? People die . Is that it ? Yes . What is the plot about ? What plot ? What is the point the movie is trying to make ? Killing is the only solution . What are the characters like ? Extremely flawed and contradictive toward their own personalities . Is there anything good about this movie ? Yes . I 'm sure they used some nice Panavision cameras in filming it . If you like constant killing and greed , then watch the movie . If you happen to be repulsed by such low - standard " entertainment " , then " Made Men " is not for you . To sum it up , the plotline stinks , the characters are n't worth their while , the storyline is completely resistable , and nothing fits together . This proves one thing : the actors , directors , and whoever helped make this movie certainly are n't " Made " .
pos	Another fantastic film from a country , where due to decades of oppression from fundamentalist regimes , has no problems in creating passionate subject matter . Panahi takes a different approach this time around with a blend of ironic comedy and an endearing , non - professional cast . While still getting across his message of what he sees as being inherently wrong with his country , he does so without the need of a heavy storyline . It is a positive take on a country , in particular its people , that the Iranian population desperately need . The greatest pity is it wo n't be released domestically . The insular , paranoid Iranian government assert that this fine film maker is only successful overseas because he is part of a global conspiracy to embarrass them . After growing up amid revolution and watching the academics , artists and educated ' disappear ' over the last 25 years he shows great bravery in continuing to put his work out there . The realism achieved by shooting at the actual world cup qualifier really transports you to the event . The fact he shot it on 35 mm is amazing as most would only attempt this project using a digital format . It looks fantastic . His insistence in only using non - professional actors also really works in this film . Fine performances all round . After watching many films showing the problems Iran has and also the news media reporting the facts we can tend to demonise the people as well as the government . This film does the opposite . It shows us they still love the same things and that by laughing at themselves and the absurd rules of sharia law that maybe a change for the better is n't too far away . Some call Panahi a feminist film maker but I think he just fights for the most oppressed demographic in Iran . Young , independent women .
neg	There 's a lot of good that can be said for this cartoon ; the backgrounds are rich , lushly colored and full of nicely done art deco details . The animation is up to the usual studio standards of the time , which are unquestionably higher than those of the present day . However , I find it tedious for a number of reasons . The Music : It 's definitely not up to Scott Bradley 's usual standards . Although it 's probably supposed to be evocative of a " Great Gatsby " setting , it ends up being dreary , sleepy , repetitious AND monotonous ( repetitious and monotonous are not the same , as Beethoven 's 5th Symphony attests ) . Since most people ( including me ) tend to close their eyes when they yawn , there 's a lot of the visual part of the cartoon that will be missed by the average viewer . The Storyline : I 'm not giving away any secrets that are n't already in the plot summary - country good , city bad . This is a common theme in films , both animated and live , from this era . It 's a misplaced nostalgia for a nonexistent rural idyll , which , in the present day , is reflected in a similar nostalgia for " values " that never were .
pos	Thank god ABC picked this up instead of Fox . The best description ( for those in the know ) is really Wonderfalls meets Dead Like Me in the best way possible . I 'm not sure whether an experience with death and destiny early in life makes me a fan of Brian Fuller but I certainly enjoy his productions . I also enjoy checkered floors , pies , talking toys , gravelings and other mischievous items :) While a bit " Burtonesque " , I certainly think this enjoys its own niche that does n't require J Depp or HB Carter to be a wonderfully imaginative playground . Here we can find the joys and sorrows of childhood and adulthood crashing into each and actually making sense and making us want to live life to the fullest !
neg	  How this film ever got a 6 star average is beyond me . The script is so banal , and frankly an insult to whomevers life it is based upon . The cinematography comes straight from the slick world of advertising , and the talented Ridley Scott should be ashamed . Demi Moore however , shows none a surprise by participating in this film , if one looks at her tracklist . All in all , a " high concept " style film that even Don Simpson would be ashamed of .
pos	John ( Ben Chaplin ) is a lonely bank clerk who lives in a small town not far from London . Though the Internet , he contacts a Russian agency of brides . He selects Sophia ( Nicole Kidman  the guy could be lonely and shy , but certainly has a good taste , does n't he ? ) and when they met each other , he realizes that she does not speak English . The communication between each other is basically limited by sex ( again , imagine , what a terrible situation for the guy , just have some kinky sex with Nicole Kidman ! ) . On her birthday , two Russian friends of her visit them . Then , lots of surprises will happen . I liked this movie : first , it is almost impossible to be ' labeled ' . Is it a black comedy , an action , a thriller movie ? I believe all the choices are correct . Nicole Kidman is gorgeous as usual , and I am very curious about her Russian : is she speaking Russian in a correct accent indeed , or just faking ? Anyway , I found it an enjoyable movie . My vote is eight . Title ( Brazil ) : " A Isca Perfeita " ( " The Perfect Bait " )

Making his escape after killing two prison guards Provo makes his way towards Yuma knowing that that 's not just where Burgade lives but where his his young daughter Susan , Barbara Hershey , resides as well . Using his fellow escaped convicts to lure Burgade into the vast Arizona Desert , by promising them $ 30,000.00 in gold coins that he buried there , Provo plans to exact his bloody vengeance on Burgade . But only after having him witness his daughter being brutally raped by his fellow convicts or are , in not being with a woman for years , as horny as a rabbit during mating season ! Brutal and very effective western that updates the John Wayne 1956 classic " The Searchers " in a father searching through dangerous Indian territory for his kidnapped daughter . Charlton Heston as the guilt - ridden Sam Burgade in his felling somehow responsible for killing Provo 's wife and then having to face the fact that the same thing can very well happen to his daughter Susan is perfect in the role of the aging and retired sheriff . Charles Coburn as the vengeful half breed Zach Provo is also at his best as the obsessed with hatred and murder escaped convict . The man who escaped with Provo are really not interest in his personal affairs but have no choice , in that he knows the territory like the back of his hand , but to go along with him . It 's only the thought of them having their way with Susan , when Provo gives them the green light , as well as the buried $ 30,000.00 in gold coins that keeps them from breaking up and going their own way . Also going along with Burgade is Susan 's boyfriend Hal Brickman , Chris Mitchum , who proves in the end that he 's as good as Burgade is , who felt that he just did n't have it in him , in both tracking down the escaped criminals as well as using common sense , which in this case Burgade lacks , in doing it . * * * SPOILERS * * * * The unbelievably brutal and blood splattered showdown between Burgade and Provo is almost too much to sit through . Provo who 's hatred of Burgade bordered on out right insanity wanted him to suffer a slow and excruciating death . it was that hatred that Bugrade took advantage of and , after taking some half dozen bullets , thus ended up putting the crazed and blood thirsty , as well as mindless , lunatic away for good !
neg	" True " story of three girls who go into the wilds of Connecticut and end up hunted by a maniac in the woods . This is the sort of film that would have played in the drive ins across America thirty years ago to mixed acclaim . Not particularly much of anything the film works with its low budget to mixed results . The film is watchable but is n't at all scary ( blame how some of the attack scenes for that ) . Its the sort of film that you 'll probably forget about once you 're done with it . Odds are that you 're never going to think to see this unless its handed to you by someone and told , " here watch this " , which is what happened to me . If you 're handed a copy give it back , the film is n't worth the effort to see it even if it is watchable .
pos	The Waiting Womans Ward of a large lying - in hospital , with all its joys and sorrows , is the place where LIFE BEGINS . This nearly forgotten drama is a fine little soap opera , replete with comedy and tragedy , all tied into the lives of the maternity staff and their patients . The frankness with which the subject matter is handled points up the movie 's pre - Code status . Marvelous Aline MacMahon , as the sympathetic head nurse , is the calm center of the film , the rock around which all the currents flow . Able to handle any crisis or emergency , she is the mothers ' best , sometimes last , friend . Surrounding MacMahon is a bevy of excellent costars : Loretta Young as a convicted murderess released from prison long enough to give birth ; Eric Linden as her frightened young husband ; brassy Glenda Farrell as a dame who hates children ; sweet Clara Blandick as a very mature mother in for her sixth birthing ; Preston Foster & Hale Hamilton as thoughtful , compassionate doctors and Frank McHugh as a comically frantic father - to - be . Movie mavens will recognize Bobs Watson as a wee tyke who wants to see the Stork ; Paul Fix as a nervous husband who promises to behave like a ` little soldier ; ' Gilbert Roland as a distraught Italian husband and Elizabeth Patterson as a snooty doctor 's wife interested in adopting Farrell 's son - all uncredited . There are a few absurdities in the plot - some of the mothers are obviously much too old ; Farrell becomes blatantly drunk in the Ward but none of the staff seem to notice ; an obviously psychotic patient is able to wander around at will - but this really only enhances the quirky entertainment value of the film and keeps things from becoming too serious .
neg	If this guy can make a movie , then I sure as hell can make one too . In fact , if you hire me to make a movie for you , I promise to do the following : 1 ) I will add more naked women . This movie had none . I think cheesy B - class horror movies are only rented because of their traditional exploitation of the female body . I would n't want to let my viewers down . 2 ) I will refrain from making too many scenes where the hero wakes up to find out it 's only a dream . I think HorrorVision had about 4 of these scenes . And , considering the movie was only like an hour long , the dream - to - movie - length ratio was quite high . And , if I do decide to do a dream sequence , I will make sure that the person wakes up without clothes on . I mean , who sleeps in leather pants ? ? 3 ) I will not rip off any movies like Star Wars or the Matrix because I will know that my budget is small and I will not want to mask my contempt for big - budget Hollywood movies by adding satirical references about them in mine .   4 ) And finally , I will not mix modern technology with the undead . I mean , a palm pilot can only be so scary ... at least they turned it into an evil rolly - polly monster before the screen blew up or something . So , if you are looking for the above qualities in your next horror production , count on me : wanna - b - movie director extraordinaire .
pos	I f you thought Sam Mendes ' first film , the much heralded American BEAUTY was a movie with style to spare , wait until you see his highly anticipated second effort , the unrelentingly grim 30 's gangster melodrama ROAD TO PERDITION . Some critics have hailed this new movie as a worthy successor to THE GODFATHER , a rash judgment made by several reviewers taken with Mr. Mendes ' extraordinary technical prowess . If the mechanics of movie making are what make a picture great , then yes , ROAD TO PERDITION is a distant cousin to THE GODFATHER in terms of what it achieves in cinematography , editing , music scoring and sound . What it does n't have is a resonance that all great stories and some very rare movies have that stay with the viewer long after the experience of reading or seeing it is over . As with American BEAUTY , there is a cold , distancing feel to this movie , despite some very tense scenes involving paternal love , loyalty and betrayal . This story of a hit man ( Tom Hanks ) and his relationship to a surrogate father - figure who is also his boss , an elderly Irish mob leader ( Paul Newman ) , seems to have been culled from innumerable gangster movies of years past . The father /son motif that hangs over this picture is so heavy handed in its treatment that there is not much room for spontaneity ; the entire enterprise has been very carefully wrought , and nearly all the dialog is delivered with an air of great portent : this is obviously a gangster film , hence the requisite amount of violence and bloodshed , but the film is nearly devoid of any humor to speak of ; only in scenes involving a young boy driving a getaway car in a cunningly edited montage is there any sense of lightheartedness to leaven the pervasive sense of doom . That being said , I have nothing but the highest praise for the stunning look of this film ; indeed , it is not an overstatement to say that this is one of the most beautifully photographed and designed movies I have ever seen . Veteran cameraman Conrad Hall will very likely win another Oscar for his work here . The production 's sets and costumes are just as exemplary ; in fact , the entire film is a technical marvel . Mr. Mendes continues to astonish with his vivid use of color , and he and Mr. Hall again make very dramatic use of red blood splattered against pale colored walls , all the more effective and disconcerting due to the preponderance of blacks , blues and grays that dominate the movie 's color scheme . If I have failed to duly note the acting , it is not because the actors do not purport themselves ably ; everyone in the film is top notch , with special mention going to the two malevolent bad guys : Daniel Craig is the classic " man you love to hate " , the spoiled , impulsive son of Newman 's gangster father ; and an almost unrecognizable Jude Law as an especially slimy miscreant who goes on pursuit of Hanks and his son and figures very importantly in the film 's riveting second half . But acting in a movie this dazzling is bound to take a back seat to the photographic fireworks on display here . If a Rolls - Royce was a movie , I 've no doubt it would look like ROAD TO PERDITION .
neg	How sheep - like the movie going public so often proves to be . As soon as a few critics say something new is good ( ie - " Shake - Cam " ) , everyone jumps on the bandwagon , as if they are devoid of independent thought . This was not a good movie , it was a dreadful movie . 1 ) Plot ? - What plot ? Bourne was chased from here to there , from beginning to end . That 's the plot . Do n't look for anything deeper than this . 2 ) Cinematography ? - Do me a favor ! Any 7 year old armed with an old and battered 8 mm movie camera would do a far better job ( I am not exaggerating here ) . This film is a tour - de - force of astonishingly amateurish camera - work . The ridiculous shaking of EVERY ( I really do mean every ) scene will cause dizziness and nausea . 3 ) Believable ? - Oh yes definitely . This is a masterpiece of credibility . I loved scenes about Bourne being chased by ( local ) police through the winding market streets of Tangier . - I 've BEEN to Tangier . Even the guides ca n't navigate their way through those streets but Bourne shook off 100 police with speed and finesse . Greengrass must be laughing his head off at the gullibility of his film disciples . 4 ) Editing ? - I do n't know what the editor was on when he did this film but I want some ! - Every scene is between 0.5 and 2 seconds . I felt nauseous at the end of the film from the strobe effect of the " scenes " flashing by . 5 ) Directing ? - Hmmm . This is an interesting aspect . The film appears to have actually NOT had any directing . More a case of Greengrass throwing a copy of the script ( all two pages ) at the cameramen and told to " shoot a few scenes whilst drunk " . - " Do n't worry boys , we 'll tie the scenes together in the editing room " . The editor should be tarred , feathered and put in the stocks for allowing this monstrosity to hit the silver screen 6 ) Not one but TWO senior CIA operatives giving the tender feminine treatment to the mistreated and misunderstood Jason Bourne . - Putting their lives on the line for someone they could n't even be sure was n't a traitor . Talk about stupid nincompoops . ( Whilst the evil male CIA members plot to terminate any operative who so much as drops a paper - clip on the floor ) . ( well , all men are evil , are n't they ? - Except for SNAGS of course ) . Yes , this really is a modern and politically correct film that shows the females to be the heroes of the day and the oppressive males as the real threat to humanity . 7 ) When the you - know - what finally hits the fan , good triumphs over evil ( just like it always does , eh ? ) and the would - be assassin gets the drop on Jason Bourne - he suddenly undergoes a guilt trip and refrains from pulling the trigger ( Yeah - right ... ) - at that very moment , the evil deputy director just happens to turn up - gun in hand and he does pull the trigger . - How did this 60 year old man run so fast and not even be out of breath ? Wonders will never cease 8) Do n't worry , there 's a senate hearing and the baddies get pulled up before the courts . Well , we ca n't have nasty , politically incorrect , CIA operatives going round shooting people , can we ? How lovely to see a true to life P.C. film of the Noughties . -------------The Bourne Ultimatum is utter rubbish .
pos	In the Old west there are always the men who live breathe violence and the women who hold their breath . A famous ¨town tamer¨ named Clit Tollinger(Robert Mitchum ) comes hired by the citizens to rid the gunslingers ( Leo Genn , Claude Atkins , among others ) , Baronland 's hoodlums . There he meets the blacksmith ( Emile Meyer ) , his daughter ( Karen Sharpe ) , her boyfriend(John Lupton ) , the marshal(Henry Hull ) and the Saloon owner ( Ted De Corsia ) . Clint as lawman is appointed deputy to bring peace and puts some cartels saying the following : ¨ Warning , wearing of guns or other weapons in town is banned . Check all hardware at the marshal 's office ¨. Clint finds his ex - girlfriend , a local madame ( Jan Sterling ) in charge of the Saloon girls ( Angie Dickinson , Barbara Lawrence , among them ) . But the town council afraid the raw methods carried out by Clint . At the end the kingpin landowner appears and attempts to murder Tollinger with his own hands . This is a tremendously exciting story of a sheriff - for - hire who had only one more killing to go . It begins as a slow - moving Western but follows to surprise us with dark characters and solid plot . The tale is almost grim , a pacifier comes to a town just in time to make sure its citizenry but later the events get worse . The highlights are the burning at Saloon and the climatic showdown at the ending . Phenomenal and great role for Robert Mitchum as avenger angel and bitter gunfighter , he 's the whole show . Vivid and lively musical score by Alex North ( Spartacus , Cleopatra ) , Atmospheric cinematography in black and white by Lee Garmes . The motion picture is stunningly realized by Richard Wilson ( Al Capone , Three in Attic ) who made good Western as ¨Invitation to a gunfighter and ¨Zane Grey¨ episodes . Watchable results for this offbeat Western .
neg	Based on Tom Wolfe 's satirical novel that was praised by all ( i have not read it yet ) Tom Hanks stars as a wall streeter who accidentally kills a black boy while lost in a bad part of NYC Willis stars as the reporter who starts Hanks on his downward spiral .. The characters are very thin and there seems to be no empathy for anyone in this movie and for a comedy or a satire there are nt a lot of laughs either .. Melanie Griffith had her breasts done during filming so a fun thing to do is to see if her boobs change size during different parts of the film .. This will keep your mind off other things like the lack of script or humor .. On a scale of one to ten .. 3
pos	Nobody truly understands the logic behind the numbering of Italian zombie - flicks , but  honestly  why would we bother ? Every single film in the Zombi-"series " delivers great fun , nasty gore and gratuitous shocks and " Zombi 3 " is no exception to this , despite all the production difficulties that occurred whilst shooting . This film began as an interesting Lucio Fulci project , who had to elaborate further on his " Zombi 2 " success , but it ended up being a typical Bruno Mattei product with more flaws and stolen ideas from previous films . The screenplay is hopelessly inept and ignores all forms of continuity , every ingenious idea from George A. Romero 's " Night of the Living Dead " and " The Crazies " is shamelessly repeated here and the acting performances are truly miserable and painful to look at . Yet all this did n't upset me for one moment because the sublime over - the - top gore compensates for everything ! On a secret army base at the Phillipines , scientists completed the bacterial warfare virus " Death One " and prepare it for transport . After a failing attempt to steal the virus , the infected corpse of a terrorist is cremated and the zombie - ashes contaminate the entire population of a nearby tourist village . The last group of survivors has to battle hyperactive and inhumanly strong zombies as well as soldiers in white overalls that received instructions to kill everything that moves in the contaminated area . This movie is comparable to Umberto Lenzi 's " Nightmare City " . Truly Bad ... but incredibly entertaining with fast - paced action sequences and several very creative zombie - madness situations . The undead birds were original , for example , and the whole zombie birth sequence at the deserted hospital was pretty cool as well . The infamous flying head scene is not nearly as awful as it 's made up to be and it belongs perfectly in this cheesy and thoroughly pleasant Italian zombie flick . Recommended to the fans ; do n't mind the negative reviews .
neg	* WARNING * Contains MANY SPOILERS ! Let me start by saying I have a huge respect for Gillian Anderson 's incredible talent as a varied and versatile actress - which is why I can not comprehend her reasons for agreeing to make this film once she saw the script ( or lack thereof . )   The premise of the film was , in my opinion , a great idea and there were some genuinely thought - provoking themes in there but it ended up like a collapsed soufflé . It exemplifies why I hate 99 % of British cinema . It feels too long , it 's tedious , for the most part , and not a lot happens after the first twenty minutes . Just when you think there 's a chance of it picking up some speed it disappoints like Paula Radcliffe running a marathon . With little imaginative directing and a minimalist plot , there is n't much to keep the audience from nodding off into their popcorn . As for the script I can only surmise that the writer was trying to save a few trees , with the average scene reading something along the lines of " Alice : F * * * OFF ! ( Adam stares . Adam runs off into woods)(Alice follows ) Alice : ADAM ! ADAM ! " I suspect that , word for word , the actors probably got paid more than Kate Moss did for her Virgin Mobile adverts . What few lines there were did n't have a lot of variation with a frequent use of the f - word that would make Bridget Jones 's friend , Shazza , proud . There is little establishment of the main characters before the main sordid event which leaves the audience lacking much sympathy for the characters beyond an automatic ' Oh that 's terrible ' reaction . Alice is n't the kind of woman who courts sympathy either . She 's got a great job , an expensive London apartment with roof space to die for yet she comes across on screen as conceited , bitter and dissatisfied before her life takes a turn for the worst . After the attack a few layers are peeled back which sort - of explain why she is this way to start with ; she grew up with a tough - as - old - boots soldier who thought that teaching her how to shoot his gun was the ultimate expression of love so , instead of following in his footsteps , she ran away to the big city in search of something to make her feel like her life is worth living . Instead she found a group of stereotypical middle - class Toffs who look down on anyone not rich enough to drive a Lexus and the luxuries that come with an integrated security / entertainment system ( i.e. becoming Mrs Robinson to a wanna - be Cockney wide - boy electrician ) Someone pass me a tissue . The one saving grace of this character is that she is played by Gillian Anderson . In the hands of a lesser actress she would 've been intolerably one - dimensional but Ms Anderson actually manages to inject a few fleeting moments of humanity into this otherwise lifeless human being , most notably when she 's sincerely apologising for her road rage in a vain attempt to stop her attackers from continuing their assault . I ca n't say that Adam fared much better either . Danny Dyer played him well as a fish - out - of - water Jack the Lad but a good performance could n't save him from both the lack of a script and the total absence of any character background .   This film relied mostly on shock value but the timing was off and it felt far too engineered from beginning to end . As for the shock , the most shocking thing about this film is the unashamed demonstration of how painfully thin Ms Anderson has become ; it was almost as unsettling to see as the brutal attack scenes . On a side note , only in a British film would a gang of violent sex attackers take the time to offer each other contraception before continuing to cheer their mates on - talk about stiff - upper - lip taken to the extreme ! If this is the kind of film that the National Lottery is donating money to make then I 'm not surprised that fewer and fewer people are choosing to spend their pound each week .   Saying that I hated this film is giving it too much credit , I did n't care enough about any of the characters to warrant that strong an emotion . I want that one - and - a - bit hours of my life back , please !
pos	This is a great example of a rather simple Film Noir story that is handled exceptionally well -- thanks to excellent direction by Otto Preminger as well as some lovely acting performances . Dana Andrews stars as a hot - headed detective who all too often uses his fists instead of his brains . Soon after the film begins , Andrews is being reprimanded for this and is warned that if this continues he 'll be off the force . A bit later , while investigating a crime he 's attacked by a suspect and Andrews is forced to fight to protect himself . This time he does NOT use excessive force but the assailant is killed . Andrews panics and assumes they wo n't believe him so he tries to cover up the death -- though instead an innocent man is ultimately blamed for the crime . There 's a lot more to the film than this -- including a plot involving a slimy villain ( Gary Merrill ) and a love interest for Andrews ( Gene Tierney ) . All in all , this is one of the better examples of the genre -- with great gritty dialog , superb lighting and a simple yet very effective story . This is the way Noir was meant to be .
neg	I do n't like this film , but then I did n't think much of the book either which , although lauded by many as a " masterpiece " , I found lacking in character development and disjointed and illogical in plot , although it was far more readable than Fante 's dreadful first effort " Road to Los Angeles " not published until Fante became fashionable in the mid 80s . I was intrigued to see what sort of soup Towne would make with such meager ingredients . He has worked hard script - wise to repair the many shortcomings of the book but for my money did n't rescue it . There was never a movie in Ask the Dust while ever he tried to stay faithful to the book . I consider this film Towne 's folly . In a word : forgettable .
pos	Deeply humorous yet honest comedy about a bunch of grownups ( Bill Paxton , Julie Warner , Kevin Pollak , Elizabeth Perkins , Vincent Spano , Matt Craven , and Diane Lane ) who are invited back to spend a week to Tomawka , a camp in ( Ontario ) Canada by their former consuelor ( Alan Arkin ) . Writer / director Mike Binder drew upon his experience at the same camp as the main source of creating a gentle and understanding yarn that makes sense . Also , the movie has plenty of funny moments , some of which are completely bizarre like my favorite , the one involves using masking tape . Newton Thomas Sigel ( " The Usual Suspects " , " Three Kings " ) provides the film with some impressive shots of the Canadian wilderness . Among the cast , Sam Raimi , director of " THE EVIL DEAD " films and " The Gift " , appears here as Arkin 's bumbling right - hand man . One more thing , this film reassured me that a camp does n't have to be a site of bloody murders .
neg	This Santa movie starts off strange and I think Santa might be a pedo . Instead of the usual elf toy makers , this Santa has apparently kidnapped kids from all across the globe and makes them sing a bit like characters from " It 's a Small World " ! I guess there are no child labor laws on the weird astral plane on which he lives ( it 's apparently NOT the North Pole and not on Earth ) ! ! None of these kids seem very happy and I kept wanting to see commandos break in and rescue the tykes , though I guess for some of the third world kids , these working conditions were perhaps an improvement over local sweatshops . I sure hope that all they do is sing and make toys . Then , the scene abruptly changes to Hell where lots and lots of demons dance about like they are in a Busby Berkeley musical . This fun in put to a stop by Satan who orders one of them , Pitch , to go to Earth to ruin Christmas ! ! Personally , I thought this movie already did that ! The Devil and his imps are actually kind of cute -- like Hot Stuff from the Harvey Comics but with cool evil goatees ! Or , if you are Puerto Rican , like a vejigante mask with a goatee !   Somehow a poverty - stricken Mexican kid named Lupita , a group of jerky kids who want to mug Santa and some rich kid are key battlegrounds for the Devil and Santa ! ! So , if the Prince of Darkness ( not Donald Trump , it 's the OTHER Prince of Darkness ) can somehow make her steal and be bad , he 'll ' win'--what , we do n't really know ! In fact , as they root her on , you get the impression that the film makers intend Santa to be Jesus -- as he has all these great powers AND fights the Devil over kids ' souls ! Later , Santa meets with his friend , Merlin . He asks him to make him a special powder that makes people dream nice dreams . Considering how much Santa laughs in the film ( like a demented chipmunk ) , I assume he must use this drug A LOT ! He immediately goes to see a blacksmith who makes him a magic key that opens ALL doors . Considering he keeps kids as his personal ' assistants ' , this magic key thing worries me immensely ! During Santa 's Christmas Eve ride , you see Lupita behave like a little angel -- one problem down . Santa then takes time out now to take care of the rich kid whose parents are selfish jerks . He gives them some sort of crazy cocktail which magically solves their problems -- two problems solved . This is a rare case where alcohol / drugs HELP kids and solves problems ! And as for the little muggers , he gives them coal ! Frustrated with his losses to Santa , Pitch then tries to steal the sleigh ( which is pulled by creepy animatronic deer ) . When this fails , he destroys Santa 's stash of ' magic powder ' ! As a result , Santa ca n't become invisible to avoid dogs and gets treed . Uh , oh ... how can Santa take a detour to the Betty Ford Clinic if he 's stuck up a tree ? ! Will St. Nick get down from the tree and get the monkey off his back or will the devils win ? If you care , tune in and see . However , be warned that the film is bat - crap crazy !   Technically speaking , the film is yecchy . While it is in color , it 's really gaudy . The music is mostly done on an organ -- which , along with bad singing from the kids , produces perhaps the worst soundtrack I 've heard in recent memory . And the story is just incomprehensible and very , very , very creepy . Devils and a Santa that kidnaps kids is just plain creep - tastic . It 's a film you should NEVER show to kids but makes a great film to watch with friends so you can laugh at it from start to finish !
pos	I have n't laughed that much in a long time - although the movie has some sad moments too , especially when it changes from hyper - funny to honest and serious . The characters are very realistic most of the times , sappy sometimes , but quite believable . I am not a fan of the Jerry Springer show - I feel sorry for the participating people . This film instead is a satire , and it is doing great . Too bad that all expletives were * beeped * out while this movie aired on public tv , that takes a lot of fun out of it . I will go rent this movie to fully enjoy it .
neg	Although I recently put this on my 10 worst films list , I have to say it 's probably no worse than Burt Reynolds in " The Maddening " or any of the " Look Who 's Talking " sequels . Still , it 's pretty nauseating , even with sexy Drew Barrymore playing something of a horror - movie answer to Holly Golightly , relocating from New York City to Los Angeles but finding out she 's being stalked by a murderous look - alike . Poor Sally Kellerman , a quirky actress of great acclaim in the ' 70s , is reduced here to a paltry supporting role , and Barrymore 's leading man George Newbern is the worst type of sitcom actor , always pausing for a laugh after every line . The picture is swill , but Drew 's bloody shower scene boasts showmanship , and the identity of the psycho ( although right out of a " Scooby Doo " episode ) is interesting . But as for the finale ... get real ! Who had to clean up THAT mess ? * from * * * *
pos	This independent , B&W , DV feature consistently shocks , amazes and amuses with it 's ability to create the most insane situations and then find humor and interest in them . It 's all hilarious and ridiculous stuff , yet as absurd as much of the film should be , there is a heart and a reality here that keeps the film grounded , keeps the entire piece from drifting into complete craziness and therein lies the real message here . This film is about how we all survive in a world gone mad . That seems to be the heart of the film . For as insane and off the wall as things get , Leon , the 30 yr . old paperboy - protagonist , always tries to keep it together . He 's like a child forever trying to catch the balloon that is floating away so that everything will work out for the best , so that everyone can have what they want . The acting in the film could have went far over the top but the exceptional cast really keeps the piece cohesive . Van Meter is perhaps the best of the bunch here with a performance that shines through her absurd diseased tics . Just as the characters in the film do , we overlook her sudden outbursts to see the real person underneath .   Majkowski is a true genius here . He takes the utmost ridiculous plot twists and keeps them real . It is his script and his cast that help keep the whole thing afloat . It 's a true testament to the skill of Majkowski and all involved that this film , with it 's grating plot and characters , never once works our nerves . Majkowski has taken a film that could have been abrasive and repugnant , and somehow given it heart and humor . This is a unique film . Not to be missed .  
neg	I should put out an alert all over saying that the movie should n't be watched . It fails to a fitting tribute in such a magnificent manner that it is almost an insult to the memory of those brave men . The special effect were horrible , I had n't expected the total failure on the part of the director to appreciate military technology . How can a machine gun which normally fires at the rate of 600 rounds per minute fire at 1/10th the speed ? How can soldiers fall forward when a grenade explodes in front of them ? How can people survive when there are artillery shells falling as close as 20 feet away ? How come the artillery shells fall only on either side of the road and not the road itself ? Not only did this disrespect for the weaponry appall me , it was the cliched situations and the incongruity of the dialogues which had me screaming murder . There were the standard dialogues like Ye bhi kisi ka bhai hai , ise laath mat maro and Pakistan se jyaada musalmaan to Hindustaan me hai and LOC cross mat karo ye mera hukum hai . Stupid to say the least . What Shobha De had written is true . The director worked without a script and it shows . There is no flow to the movie . There is no gradual progression from one battle to another . It is just one gunfight after the next with no connection to the overall scheme of the war . The explanatory scenes are awful . The chief of army staff looks unconvincing . To make matters worse the theatre people had indiscriminately cut footage to fit the four hour long movie into 3 hours .
pos	Shannon Lee , the daughter of Bruce Lee , delivers high kicking martial arts action in spades in this exhilarating Hong Kong movie and proves that like her late brother Brandon she is a real chip off the old block . There is high tech stuntwork to die for in this fast paced flick and the makers of the Bond movies should give it a look if they want to spice up the action quotient of the next 007 adventure as there is much innovative stuff here with some fresh and original second unit work to bolster up the already high action content of " AND NOW , YOU'RE DEAD " . When you watch a movie as fast paced and entertaining as this you begin to wonder how cinema itself was able to survive before the martial arts genre was created . I genuinely believe that movies in general and action movies in particular were just marking time until the first kung fu movies made their debut . Bruce Lee was the father of modern action cinema and his legitimate surviving offspring Shannon does not let the family name down here . Although there are several pleasing performances in this movie ( Michel Wong for one)it is Shannon Lee whom you will remember for a genuinely spectacular performance as Mandy the hitgirl supreme . Hell;you may well come away whistling her fights !
neg	Well then , what is it ? ! I found Nicholson 's character shallow and most unfortunately uninteresting . Angelica Huston 's character drained my power . And Kathleen Turner is a filthy no good slut . It 's not that I " do n't get it " . It 's not that I do n't think that some of the ideas could 've lead to something more . This is a film with nothing but the notion that we 're supposed to accept these ideas , and that 's what the movie has going for it . That Nicholson falls for Turner is absurd , but then again , it is intended to be so . This however does not strike me as a.)funny , or b.) ... even remotely interesting ! ! ! This was a waste of my time , so do n't let the hype get the best of you ... it is a waste of your time ! With all that being said , the opening church sequence is quite beautiful ...
pos	This is a great story of family loyalty which , thankfully , does n't resort to the usual tricks ( or at least the ones I 'm used to seeing in American and European films ) of supersentimentality or high dramatic tension . It 's very watchable and very lovable . It has some beautiful cinematography , but does n't rely on that alone to entertain .
neg	The fact that someone actually spent money on such a bad script , is beyond me . This really must be one of the worst films , in addition to " Haunted Highway " I have ever seen . BAD actors , and a really bad story . There 's no normal reactions to any event in this film , and even though it 's Halloween , normal people would have bigger reactions when they 're witnessing their father being killed , not to mention gutted , people with tape covering their airways , not being able to breathe ( in a room with at least 50 people I might add ) and some person dressed up as Satan dragging dead people out of his house , even an 8 year old would see the difference between a doll and a person . Not to mention the fact that no one could possibly be that naive and dumb to believe the reality of Satan and Jesus ' appearances on the same day , like this kid does . When i was 8 , I sure had more brains than that .   But , the really stupid thing is that everyone else seems to be falling for this mute Satan look - alike as well , no questions asked . The question throughout the film is , is it really Satan , or is it some crazy person killing people off whenever he feels like it ? Well , he 's got human hands , arms , built and whatever , so I guess he 's supposed to be in the movie as well , otherwise they did a lousy job concealing it . Then , with this person being human and all , he was able to kill an old lady , a man and his mistress , 5 ( ! ! ? ? ? ) cops ( all with guns and training i presume ) , and a few other people ..... and obviously everyone was just standing there waiting for him , or what ? The whole concept and way of telling the story is absolutely the worst thing I 've seen , and I would never recommend anyone to waste 1 hour and 30 minutes of their lives to watch this total crap .
pos	Since I am so interested in lake monsters i really dug this movie . This movie is worth a see . If you like the so awful they are good types of films check it out . The effects are really good as well just think " Land of the Lost " . I originally watched this movie in the early 90 's maybe more like 89/90 on a local channel monster show called " Morgus Presents " . I did n't scare me but I was 8 and anything B felt more like an A. Years later I seen it on DVD at a local Circuit City and bought it immediately so I can give it a 9 because it has a personal spot in my heart right there with The Monster Squad and Gremlins . Good B movie fun for all ages .
neg	Why did the histories of Mary and Rhoda have to be so dour ? Divorced women with indifferent daughters . And why very little reference to the original show and characters ? The daughter characters were silly and uninteresting . Why ca n't there ever be daughters who like their mother 's on TV ? It makes sense that Mary would leave Minneapolis , and Rhoda would return to NYC , but why could n't Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens be guest stars ? It just seems a pitiful way to remember such wonderful characters . It was good to see Mary and Rhoda together of course , but it could have been better , much better . Well , there has been a Mary Tyler Moore Show Reunion , a Dick Van Dyke Show Reunion , hopefully Mary will do better next time if she revisits her old Mary Richards stomping grounds again .
pos	Culled from the real life exploits of Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie in 1890s New York , " The Bowery " is high energy and good natured . But be warned : Casual racial epithets flow off the tongues of Wallace Beery and little Jackie Cooper . The very first shot might be startling . This is true to the time it was set and the time it was made . And it also speaks to the diversity of population in that neck of the woods . It certainly adds to the gritty flavor of the atmosphere . Beery as Connors is the blustering thunder at the center of the action , a loud - mouth saloon keeper with his own fire brigade . And he has a soft spot for ornery orphan Cooper . Raft as Brodie is Connors ' slicker , better looking rival in almost every endeavor . Brodie could never turn down a dare and loved attention , leading up to a jump off the Brooklyn Bridge ( it is still debated whether he actually jumped or used a dummy ) . Beery is as bombastic as ever with a put - on Irish - American accent . He is just the gruff sort of character to draw children , cats and ladies in distress . This is possibly the most boisterous character Raft ever played , and he even gets to throw in a little dancing ( as well as a show of leg ) . And again he mistakes the leading lady ( lovely Fay Wray ) for a prostitute . Cooper is as tough as either of them , though he gets a chance to turn on the tears . The highlight is n't the jump off the bridge but a no - holds - barred fistfight between Connors and Brodie that in closeup looks like a real brawl between the principals . It 's sure someone bruised more than an ego .
neg	I do n't like Sean Penn 's directing very much , and this early work , The Indian Runner , is no exception . The movie has no core , it 's colored with a kind of redneck , anti - authoritarian tweeness that in all honesty taints most of Penn 's work , his latest work even more so than the earlier . Frank Miller , Robert Rodriguez , Clint Eastwood , Sean Penn , the whole lot seem to produce such fundamentally banal product , ostensibly in some allegiance to honesty , but ending up being , for the most part , glorified pro wrestling matches , and moralistic , almost as if Hallmark cards had developed a line of Hell 's Angels greetings , and make me long for the days of Deliverance , which is a fine movie . Viggo Mortensen 's acting is much , much more believable here than that ridiculous Eastern Promises thing he did with Cronenberg , and that 's about it . The movie is dead meaningless , and seems to be an exercise , a series of techniques , more than a story . Kudos for Charles Bronson , however , who proves he can act . And I wanted more of Sandy Dennis ' character . A lousy 3 out of 10 for this The Indian Runner crap .
pos	Saw this my last day at the festival , and was glad I stuck around that extra couple of days . Poetic , moving , and most surprisingly , funny , in it 's own strange way . It 's so rare to see directors working in this style who are able to find true strangeness and humor in a hyper - realistic world , without seeming precious , or upsetting the balance . Manages to seem both improvised , yet completely controlled . It I hesitate to make comparisons , because these filmmakers have really digested their influences ( Cassavetes , Malick , Loach , Altman ... the usual suspects ) and found their own unique style , but if you like modern directors in this tradition ( Lynne Ramsay , David Gordon Greene ) , you 're in for a real treat . This is a wonderful film , and I hope more people get to see it . If this film plays in a festival in your city , go ! go ! go !
neg	Back in the 70 's , when I had first seen this , I was in high school . It was cool then . Now as an adult I look back at it and I say to myself .. yeah right . What was so funny ? It has it 's moments but they are few and far between . It is so dated that the jokes no longer stand up . Show this to a younger crowd and they will be totally lost . If you like this type of humor you may want to stick with Kentucky Fried Movie or Amazon Women From The Moon . Tunnel Vision as well as Groove tube are too dated for today 's viewing .
pos	I saw this movie at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival and it is a movie and not a film since it apparently was shot by HBO to be shown on their cable network sometime this year . This movie presents Page as a bondage and discipline fetish pinup and B&D stag film actress who had enough talent to become a real actress . Page was a little more than that and the film touches on some of her other roles in modeling but not enough to balance out the career of the 50 's pinup icon . This film is supposedly based on the book " The Real Bettie Page " by Richard Foster . It 's shot in black and white for that 1950 's nostalgia feel . I have the book called " Bettie Page The Life of a Pinup Legend " that has a lot of great photos chronicling the career of Page and I must say that this movie reproduces on film , with Gretchen Mol as Page , many of those famous photo 's very accurately . Mol herself with the Bettie Page black wig and brown contact lenses is Bettie Page . Not only does she have the Bettie Page look but she has the smile and characteristics of her personality that came through the camera down perfect . And her body is as close to a replica of Page 's as possible . Terrific casting . The story is kind of thin and tabloidesque and certainly could have been a lot better . But this is a pretty good TV movie . I would rate it a 7.0 of a scale of 10 and recommend it 's viewing when it comes on TV .
neg	supposedly based on the life of Domino Harvey a model turned bounty hunter . I 'd say 95 % is fabricated . I always keep an open mind when it comes to movies , however , this movie lost its chances when it became apparent it had narration throughout the film , something i ca n't stand , and to top it off , the heroine of the story is so hateful and depicted as an arrogant b!ch I just wanted it to end with her being shot in the head . it 's too incoherent , too flashy and way too boring , it 's a who gives a crap kinda story , and i really think that big time directors need to make movies based on their own or a writer 's own imagination not something based on some ignorant snobby brat 's life .
pos	I would n't go so far as to not recommend this movie , since the only problems I have with it are due to an overexposure to the plot devices used in the movie - the sort of things common to every kids movie ever made it seems . That does n't make it bad , just not something I 'd go far . It is a little saccharine , so I might say that for the most part anyone looking for something with a little more wit could be disappointed in an obviously for - kids movie like this . However , all of that goes out the window when that squirrel ( the one in all the trailers ) comes on - screen . His time is limited , but it seems apparent that the decision makers had the wisdom to tell these guys ' hey , could you stick in a little more squirrel ? ' every time it 's getting intolerably dull . That does n't save the movie , but you can leave saying ' at least there was one aspect where I could n't stop laughing . ' And of course , visually it wo n't disappoint , but that 's almost a given with Pixar flicks . Of all of their stuff , I 'd put this at the bottom ... but that is n't in itself bad .
neg	They really ca n't get stupider than this film dealing with 3 losers who try to capture the college spirit during the annual spring break festivities at many of our higher schools of learning . The problem is that these losers try to do this 15 years after their college years when one is assigned to watch over the daughter of a woman senator being groomed to be the next vice president . Trouble is that her daughter is anything but popular , but of course she comes out of all that . The girls go through drunken rages , exotic dancing and other absolute nonsense . It really ca n't get much worse than this awful film .
pos	If ever there were an inspiring story that could move anyone , disabled or not , to persevere despite the odds and make it ( even when " make it " as an expression , proper , can have a wide berth which is an ultimately personal truth ) , MY LEFT FOOT is it . It 's a hard film to watch at times : seeing the less placid aspects of Christy Brown 's personality emerge in two key scenes -- one when his sister declares she is pregnant and about to get married while his father has a bad reaction , and at a dinner table when the woman who 's reached out to him , made him able to communicate effectively , now has announced at a key moment ( the inauguration of Brown 's art ) she is about to marry another man -- is tough . Very , very tough . More so because this is a man who can not react accordingly to these events and can only express himself in the only way he knows how : via screams , shrieks , and profanities aimed at hurting himself . However , this is not a story of heartache and family dysfunction even when there is quite a bit of it furnishing the autobiographical account , but that of a man overcoming his severe disability , becoming a functioning human being and a force of be reckoned with in the art world . Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar for his powerful , unforgettable performance as the flawed but tenacious Christy Brown , and Brenda Fricker did so as well for her supporting role as Brown 's solid mother .
neg	Stewart Kane ( Gabriel Byrne , VANITY FAIR ) heads out with his local Jindabyne , Australia fishing buddies for a weekend of rest , recreation , and relaxation . But when Stewart discovers an aboriginal woman 's body floating face - down in a river , things appear to have turned out for the worst . The largest casualty of the weekend is the men 's commonsense . They do n't hike out of the ravine , and instead finish their fishing weekend with some great catches . Then they head out and report the body . The town and the men 's lives quickly turn into a mess . The local media swarms them , and accusations of aboriginal prejudices rear up from the local natives . Stewart 's wife Claire ( Laura Linney , THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE ) senses the deeper meanings of what her husband and his friends did , but has to battle with it through her own mental illness . Amidst all this chaos is the life that was this young woman who is now a media spectacle , splayed out on a morgue slab . Her murder and subsequent dumping into the water are symbolic of what lay beneath the town of Jindabyne : a division of men and women , black and white , social and outcast . The only other people who seem to understand some of what is going on are two young kids : Stewart and Claire 's son who is being led around by a half - breed Aussie who 's mother was killed also just a few years before . The young girl lives with her grandparents and is trying to let go of her mother the best way she can , and the discovery of a new body seems  strangely enough  a method in which to accomplish this ( again , the underlying current of Jindabyne is surmised ) . Everything and everyone in this Jindabyne township feels what lurks beneath its surface , yet none of them are willing to dive into the murky waters and take a look around ( the symbolism here is seen when a nearby lake that is used for recreation and swimming is said to contain the old town of Jindabyne under its surface ) . None , that is , until Claire forces them to . The movie is interesting if a bit too convoluted . There are far too many story lines that needed exploring and it just does n't get done ; too many loose threads . The acting was okay , but the filming was terrible . Wobbly cameras , grainy or dark shots , and just a generalized sloppiness hurt the overall production . I enjoy symbolic films , NORTHFORK being one of my all - time favorites in that vein . But Jindabyne needed to peak its head above the turbid water so that it could see its own problems , which simply did n't happen .
pos	First of all , I think the below comment is unworthy for a site like this . Obviously you have no taste and you do n't respect the taste of others . Not to give you a history lesson but I think it needs to be done . Black actors out there are just , if not more , successful as others . If you are not a part of the " Black " race you can not understand the quality , creativeness , and vibrant of old movies such as " Sparkle " and " Mahogany " and " Cooley High . " Since unfortunately you are not Black , you do not have the pleasure of feeling what we feel when we watch these classics , so therefore you need to keep your freaking mouth shut and just stick to your non - dancing race . Thanks .
neg	What a bad movie . I 'm really surprised that DeNiro and even Snipes would be associated with something like this . If you 're going to make a movie that involves baseball , and shows scenes of baseball , at least make the action look somewhat realistic . Why was the crowd always standing up for no particular reason during games ? * * * POSSIBLE SPOILER * * * And the last scene in the movie .... what was that ? We are somehow led to believe that DeNiro has found his way onto the field in an umpire 's uniform , and that the game is even being played in a torrential downpour .... one of the worst ever scenes in a sports movie . 3 stars out of 10 .
pos	Some guys think that sniper is not good because of the action part of it was not good enough . Well , if you regard it as an action movie , this view point could be quite true as the action part of this movive is not actually exciting . However , I think this is a psychological drama rather than an action one . The movie mainly told us about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences . Tomas Beccket , who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills , looked as if he was cold - hearted . However , after Beccket showed his day dream of Montana , we can clearly see his softness inside . It was the cruel war and his partners ' sacrifice that made Beccket become so called cold - hearted . Millar , on the contrary , was a new comer , a green hand , and was even not qualified as a sniper . Billy Zane did quite well to show millar 's hesitation and fear when he first tried to " put a bullet through one 's heart"(as what Beccket said ) . What he thought about the actuall suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely get back and receive the award . These two guys were quite different in their personalities and I think that the movie had successfully showed the difference and the impact they had to each other due to the difference in their personalities . These two snipers quarreled , suspected each other and finally come to an understanding by the communication and by what they had done to help even to save the other . Sniper is n't a good action movie but a good psychological one .
neg	I rarely make these comments but I felt compelled to spare others the pain I endured in watching this movie . It 's so stupid and implausible both in the overall story and in the details that you simply ca n't suspend disbelief . The problem starts early , when you see a government researcher tooling around in a new Porsche and dining with his team in a restaraunt that looks like a castle , overlooking the Capitol Building in Washington , D.C. That kind of life on a government salary ? Hah ! It only gets worse . Toward the end , when the bad guy starts killing off the good guys , the latter group act so stupidly that you want them to die , in order to cleanse the gene pool . The special effects are pretty good - any producer 's money can buy that - and the lead actors have been great in other films , but the screenplay and direction here are moronic . Many people have wondered whether there was some deliberate intelligence behind Paul Verhoeven 's previous , facially stupid movies ( Showgirls , Starship Troopers ) , but this movie should stop the wondering . He 's just plain bad .
pos	After high - school graduation , best friends Alice and Darlene , decide to take a trip to Thailand . Whilst they are there , they meet a charming Australian guy named Nick . After spending some time with Nick , he asks them if they want to take a weekend trip to Hong Kong with him . They agree . At the airport though , they are get busted for smuggling drugs and then get convicted for 33 years in a Thai prison for something they say they have n't done . Not really knowing what to do they end contacting Yankee Hank , an American lawyer who lives in Thailand with his wife . Word has it that if you have the money he can help you . Things start of well , but they still ca n't get out . The movie is really good because it does n't let on what 's going to happen and it 's interesting all the time . I could n't believe the ending though . It was one of those endings where you do n't know the 100 % truth , but you still kind of know what really happened with Nick and the drug smuggling because of the ' owning up ' etc .   Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale both give quite good performances here . Beckinsales performance was a little weak though . Both Danes and Beckinsales characters friendship is good but could of seemed stronger . Paul Walker even has a small uncredited role here . ;) Anyway , I thought Brokedown Palace was a good movie and I give it a 7/10 .
neg	This movie had all the elements to be a smart , sparkling comedy , but for some reason it took the dumbass route . Perhaps it did n't really know who its audience was : but it 's hardly a man 's movie given the cast and plot , yet is too slapstick and dumb - blonde to appeal fully to women . If you have seen Legally Blonde and its sequel , then this is like the bewilderingly awful sequel . Great actors such as Luke Wilson should expect better material . Jessica Simpson could also have managed so much more . Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller languish in supporting roles that are silly rather than amusing . Many things in this movie were paint - by - numbers , the various uber - cliché montages , the last minute " misunderstanding " , even the kids ' party chaos . This just suggests lazy scriptwriting . It should be possible to find this movie enjoyable if you do n't take it seriously , but it 's such a glaring could - do - better than you 'll likely feel frustrated and increasingly disappointed as the scenes roll past .
pos	I 've joined IMDb so people know what a great film this is ! It 's not often you come across a film that 's moving and visually cinematic yet humble . You 've read the plot so all I want to say is do n't watch it because you want to see a clash of cultural religious identity babble , because that 's the typical misconception people read in to , instead just appreciate and realise it 's about a father and son on a voyage growing to know each other through their struggles . Buy it and pass it on before film4 get round to it . This was one of the very few films to be nominated for a BAFTA being independent and foreign . The beauty of it is that it manages to appeal to anyone even if you never watch anything subtitled or just used to the Hollywood formula , just a great story that will keep you engaged . The only thing I wish is for it to be longer and see what happens
neg	I enjoy quality crapness , and this ranks up there with some of the finest . the cg is out of this world , or at least pre - dates our world , and the insanity of a 6 foot bloke in a rat outfit chasing after people is laughably bad . I quite enjoyed some of this , but the acting is so goddamn awful , and even the obligatory nude scene does n't really have any baps out in it . just a complete waste of time if ever i saw one . I do n't know who wasted more time , me watching this , or the poor saps who got dragged into making it in the faint hope that this will launch their acting careers . I can assure you , it wo nt . However , on a brighter note , I have managed to successfully do the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon from this movie , so I think it was almost worthwhile watching the 91 minutes of it .
pos	THE TENANTS began as a 1971 short novel by the now deceased Bernard Malamud - writer / philosopher - examining the conflicts between Jews and African Americans in the incendiary atmosphere of Brooklyn at the time the book was written . As a novel the story was gut wrenchingly real : as transcribed into a screenplay by novices David Diamond and Danny Green ( who also directs ) it is more of a cerebral dissertation that gradually erupts into action in the final moments . Harry Lesser ( Dylan McDermott ) is a Jewish novelist with one book under his belt but currently attempting to finish his ' newest ' book ten years into the writing . Convinced that he must complete the novel in the same environment where it was started . he is the sole tenant in a condemned Brooklyn tenement owned by Levinspiel ( Seymour Cassel ) who constantly tries to ' buy out ' Harry 's lease so that the filthy dilapidated building can be demolished . Into this atmosphere enters another Black militant quasi - anti - Semitic writer Willie Spearmint ( Snoop Dogg ) whom Harry befriends , hides , and offers help to the nascent novelist 's attempt to write about the death of all white people . Harry 's attempts to help Willie lead to conflict , not the least of which is Harry 's meeting Willie 's girlfriend , the white Jewish Irene Bell ( Rose Byrne ) at a less than friendly gathering of Willie 's militant black brothers and sisters . Willie and Irene are on the skids and Harry gradually falls in love with Irene and they plan to leave New York as soon as Harry finishes his novel . When Willie hears of the assignation and is further critiqued by Harry , Willie explodes and begins the downward descent of not only a delicate friendship but also a competition between writers . The ending ' reveals the slippery nature of the human condition , and the human capacity for violence and undoing ' . The actors do their best with a script that is a bit awkward but despite scripted lines that border on preaching they create believable characters . The cinematography enhances the story , keeping the mood dank and dense and primarily confined to the condemned building . The musical score appropriately makes use of the solo jazz trumpet and blues piano to underline the tension and isolation of each of these groundless characters . Though it takes some patience to make it through the cerebral ramblings , the film in the end is worth watching . At least it attempts to recreate Malamud 's bizarre look at life in the big city .

neg	TV movie about an ancient Egyptian curse brought to the US in the 20 's during the filming of DeMille 's first version of the 10 Commandments and which is reawakened when DeMille 's sets are unearthed in the desert . One of the worst films I 've seen in a long time . The question is were the filmmakers serious or kidding when they made this film ? If this is serious its a laughably bad movie and a great film to pick on for its badness . If its a comedy its less good but funny for all of the wrong reasons . You will laugh long and hard AT this film , probably more than many other Hollywood " comedies " .
pos	It 's really annoying when good movies like this one go unnoticed . But I 'm glad I did not miss it . They should re - release it with a lot more publicity . I do not think they did anything to promote it . Great work Paxton .
neg	John Rivers ' life as an architect and family man has taken a turn for the worst when his wife has disappeared and has been concluded dead after a freakish accident that involved changing a tyre on her car . During the days she has been missing , he confronts a man that 's been following and he tells him that his been in contact with his dead wife from the other - side through E.V.P - Electronic Voice Phenomenon . Naturally he does n't believe it but then hear gets weird phone calls from her phone and so he contacts the man to find out more about E.V.P. Soon enough John is hooked onto it , but something supernatural does n't like him interfering with the dead , as now other then contacting his wife , the white noise is foretelling events before they happen . Since this DVD has been sitting on my shelf for a while now , I thought I better get around to watching it since it was n't my copy . But then again I do n't think the owners were in a hurry to get it back , as they have n't question me about it . Oh well . So I decided to give it a play , as I was in an undemanding mood . After hearing and reading all the bad press on it , I was n't expecting anything remotely good , but I was kept entertained for 90 minutes . Well , more so the 60 minutes , as the last half - an - hour was pretty much a blur of confusion . The film is nowhere as good as it could have been , but the time breezed by quick enough even though it 's a rather tepid supernatural thriller . I thought it was n't all a waste . The first hour I found some effective sequences rather interesting and there 's a spooky awe generated with a slow progression of subtle stillness and tragedy that haunts you , but sadly that comes to a crashing halt later on in the film . That 's when the predictably forced jump scares come into their own and somehow it just does n't fit in with the context . It becomes rather hectic , loud and very muddled with its MTV style editing and kinetic camera - work that gets to close into the action . I could n't understand what was going on within choppy and abrupt climax . The whole explanation how everything fits into the bigger picture is pure hokey . It 's a very unsatisfying conclusion because it goes for something big , but hits rock bottom . I thought they did fine job up until that point with the lighting and showy camera - work . Other then the distinctively stark lighting , the score kept this flick atmospherically gloomy . All of it is very slickly done with its glossed up and fancy hardware , which makes it come across as very sterile and empty . You can easily see that the film 's heart is in the technical components and not in expanding the characters and story . There 's just no connection and lasting sentiment within this flimsy material . After a while , it just tries too hard to convince you that it falls into manipulative thrills and popping in many blood - curdling stuff from beyond the grave . It just got rather repetitious watching someone watch a fuzzy TV screen after while . The E.V.P machine was the star on the show . Well , it did have more impact than the limp performances . Michael Keaton is more than capable actor , but lately his disappeared off the map and here he provides a modest performance as the dangerously obsessed John Rivers . He really deserves much better , though . Everyone else is pretty brittle and forgettable . Not because of the performances , but of the lack of depth in their characters . This clunker was n't bad to begin with , but it does go pear shape by falling away drastically . I would n't care to see it again and I would n't recommend to anyone , unless you got a interest for the subject matter and enjoy the recent crop of Hollywood produced horror / thrillers . It 's just a damn shame that this over - produced flick could n't put it together successfully , as it had promise in its idea and a more than decent cast on hand . I did n't hate it , but what a disappointment .
pos	Had this movie been made a few years later , I would have given it a lower score . However , for 1909 , this was a dandy little movie and still stands up pretty well today . Just do n't try to compare this silent film to later silents -- the industry changed so radically that the shorts of the first decade of the 20th century do n't look at all like movies made in the 1910s and beyond . This movie is 11 minutes long ( about average for most films back then ) and is a variation of the Edgar Allen Poe story , THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO . While many are familiar with the story , I wo n't elaborate further as I do n't want to ruin the film . Just suffice to say that it 's very creepy ! !
neg	Spoiler ! ! I love Branagh , love Helena Bonham - Carter , loved them together in " Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein " - but THIS - I can understand an actor 's desire to stretch , to avoid the romantic stereotype . Well , they did , but really - the script droned on , Bonham - Carter 's clothes were tres chic , and the occasional speeded - up " madcap " sequence could have been an outtake from a Beatles ' movie , or the old Rowan and Martin Laugh - In . I never got the point - other commenters say the Branagh character was a dreamer . I never felt that . He was a loser , and not very bright , and certainly not endearing . The business with the bank robber disguise was merely painful to watch . Certainly not amusing . Bonham - Carter 's realistic ( one supposes ) attempts as realistic speech were harder to understand than the first 15 minutes of Lancashire accent in " Full Monty . " The poetic ending , with him high on a hill with her buried under the monstrosity of his airplane was too orchestrated . Was there a choir of angels , or merely a soundtrack ? Go back to the classics or something with a spine and an arc to it . Donate this to PBS .
pos	Two thirds of nearly 2,000 IMDb users who have voted on this film have rated it at 8 , 9 or 10 and one user reports wearing out six videotapes ( Was this a record , or merely a faulty VCR ? ) . Although the film is primarily intended as a period piece it clearly has a quite unusual fascination . But for some reason I imagined it as largely whimsy and until recently never felt the urge to watch it . My mind was changed by Elizbeth Von Arnim 's original book . My wife loves reading but her sight no longer allows her to read much so she borrowed it in talking book form . Such books are usually irritating to a companion who is busy with other things , but I gradually came to appreciate that this one was seductively soothing , although in no way syrupy , and was also very well written . I realised my wife would enjoy watching the film , and so decided to buy her the videotape . I am now very glad that I did , and would certainly recommend its purchase to anyone else who appreciates a quiet reflective work with no fireworks but with well constructed character development and a very successful pre - Mussolini Italian atmosphere . The story is set in the immediate post WW1 period and starts with two married London ladies who decide to pool their savings and enjoy a holiday together , away from their families , in a rented villa in Italy . Force of circumstances lead to this couple being joined by two others with very different characters and backgrounds . Its theme is essentially no more than the interactions that take place as their holiday progresses , not only between these four very disparate mature ladies , but also with the occasional male visitor . If you want action , thrills , dramatic sex scenes , natural or man - made disasters , or Harlequin style romances this would not be the film for you . But IMDb users have collectively and very emphatically demonstrated that none of these are necessary for a film to prove highly rewarding to watch , and if you care to give it a try you may , as I did , come to rank it among your much loved films . It is fairly rare for me to watch a film of a book with which I am already familiar . In many cases I find this takes some of the pleasure away from watching the film , but here there is such a strong visual appeal in the setting that I actually found my pleasure augmented by the anticipation of seeing the next segment of the book , effectively unrolled before my eyes . ( Perhaps Italy itself has some part in this , the last time I had this experience was when I was watching tales from Boccaccio 's Decameron on TV . ) Generally films of books tend to increase the dramatic level of the original work to ensure that the filmed version has an even wider appeal , but here if anything it is reduced in order to keep the viewers attention on the gradual character development rather than on any background events . This works very well , although changes from the book are few and basically the film remains true to the original story . Great credit is due to the Director , Mike Newell , and all members of the cast , particularly those well known British Actresses who play the four principal ladies .
neg	As a huge fan of horror films , especially J - horror and also gore i thought Nekeddo burâddo sounded pretty good . I researched the plot , read reviews , and even looked at some photos to make sure it seemed like a good gory and scary movie to watch before downloading it . So excited it had finished and ready to be scared and recoiling in horror at the amazing gore i was expecting i was terribly disappointed . The plot was ridiculous and did n't even make sense and left too much unexplained , the gore was hilarious rather then horrifying , and what was with the cartoon style sound effects ? The acting was probably the only thing mildly scary about it . I did not understand the cactus idea and the way the mothers husband disappeared in the middle of the sea after following a flashing light , they left both pretty unexplained , or perhaps i missed it as my mind could n't understand what i was actually seeing . I appreciate the way it was supposed to be ; shocking and a few scenes ( the strange cannibalism and own mother kissing?)certainly were , i just think they went a little bit far and not even in a horrifying way , they made it to unconvincing which made it more believable to be a comedy rather than a horror in my opinion . However it is a very entertaining film and got a lot of laughs out of me and a couple of friends , but sadly we were expecting horror not comedy so its worth a watch for the entertainment value , but do n't be expecting a dark , deeply scary and horrifying film ; you 'll just be disappointed . If this was a horror comedy / spoof i 'd probably rate it about a nine , the climax being the weird scene when the husband climbed inside his wife 's stomach and closed up her wounds , but as a horror sadly i gave it a one .
pos	this movie is another on the list that i did not want to see . i was talked into it and dragged into the theater , but boy am i glad for that . i thought it was going to be just another love story , but it turns out to be SOOO much more than that . definatly an intellectual flick , one of those movies you have to pay attention to .
neg	I was staying in one night and got extremely bored around 2:00 a.m. so I flipped aimlessly through the channels and happened upon H.B.O. where this " classic " was playing . Initially I was happy to have caught something at the beginning , but my happiness faded about two minutes into the movie . The whole movie centered around an unattractive man who had a fear of females , four beautiful but empty minded women who worked as waitresses at his uncle 's diner , and his enormously fat and extremely miserable cousin who also works at the diner . There are a few strange twists in this movie that make it somewhat interesting , but certainly not worth watching . Basically , if you have nothing to do some night or just ca n't sleep medication works much better . However guys there is a lot of skin so it may be okay to watch with no sound , but even that can get annoying
pos	Why did n't Dynamo have any pants ? ! Where did they go ? ? It was never explained . That 's why this movie was so awesome . Plus Starsky gave his kids the AIDS ! ! ! ! Great acting too . Richard Dawson deserved to win Best Supporting Actor ! A I D S My favorite line from the movie was " That hit the spot " A I D S. This movie was for the " birds " . I tried to give this movie the " stinkeye " but it continued playing . What am I doing wrong ? ? ? ! ! ! ! I thought the " HATEBOAT " was funnnny lol ;) I would like that for a show . Why was n't Dynamo wearing pants . I know his arm WAS skewered but ... What 's up with those crazy futur nets . Why did n't that family feud guy Ray Combs get a net ? ? He could have used one . AIDSSSSS
neg	I suppose all the inside jokes is what made Munchies a cult classic . I thought it was awful , though given the ridiculous story and the nature of the characters , it probably could 've been a much better ( and funnier ) movie . Maybe all they needed was a real budget . Munchies , as many viewers have pointed out already , is something of a Gremlins parody . Hence , all the references to the movie . The movie begins somewhere in Peru during an archeological dig . An annoying dufus named Paul , aspiring stand up comedian who offers no sarcasm or witty jokes during the movie despite his career plans , is holed up with his dad in the caves . His dad is an unconventional kind of archeologist , searching the caves not for artificats or mummies or anything , but proof of U.F.O. 's . And that 's where the Munchies come into the picture . Hidden in the crevice of a rock is an ugly little mutant that looks like a gyrating rubber doll with a Gizmo voice . They name him Arnold , stash him in a bag , and bring him home so Paul 's dad can finally show proof of extra terrestrial life . Paul , the idiot that he is , breaks his promise to his dad to watch Arnold ( a wager he made with his dad , if he loses , it 's off to community college to get a ' real ' career ) . The creepy next door neighbor with the bad rug , Cecil ( television veteran Harvey Korman ) , wonders what his neighbors are up to . So , he and his lazy son , some airhead hippie type ( who looks more like they should 've made his character a biker or heavy metal enthusiast ) to go and snatch Arnold . Why ? A get rich quick scheme of course . And of course , even Cecil 's son is too dumb to look after Arnold . And after a few pokes and prods at Arnold , he multiplies into more Munchies . This was n't even a movie that was so bad it was good . It was just plain awful . I was hoping that the Munchies would 've mutated and killed the morons that were always after them , even Paul and his girlfriend . At least it would be one way to get rid of all the bad acting in this movie that really hams up the movie . Not to mention poor special effects that look like hand puppets . And really bad writing all around -- it was n't even funny -- not even that young cop who can really give you the homicidal twitch in your eye . Like I said , Munchies , if they had been given an actual budget and better actors , they might 've been able to pull off a good parody . Pass .
pos	In his directorial debut , Denzel Washington takes a true story that also happens to be a very difficult story and brings it to the screen with an honesty that we have come to expect from Washington 's acting efforts , but now we see this touch as a director . Recently we have seen some of the disastrous results of kids who have fallen through the cracks of public protection . This story tells of a nightmare existence that leaves terrible scars but suggests the triumph of the human spirit in the end . We can nit pick on some first effort problems with too many close ups and not the best of editing these scenes but the simplicity of other scenes that project such power can not be understated . If the academy overlooks this film it will be travesty . This film pulls no punches and goes to the cold hard facts of the story with a purity that usually does n't transcend from a novel to the screen . This , of course , is a tribute to the Director . This is a dandy so go see it and tell your friends to go see it too !
neg	In spite of sterling work by the supporting actors , and an intelligent script by Alan Plater , this film suffers from a fatal flaw - the lack of charm of the central character / actor . One of the characters describes Richard E Grant 's character as " a whining little turd " and unfortunately this sums him up perfectly . There is nothing about him or his performance to make it credible that his girlfriend and upper - class publisher / friend would spend so much time and emotional effort on him . He is rude , arrogant , selfish , self - destructive and thoroughly annoying . The part called for an actor who can make you love him even when he is being a prate - a Ewan McGregor , for example . All of the witty satire on the class system etc was wasted , thanks to this irritating and thoroughly unlikeable performance . All I wanted to do was shake him and tell him to get over himself .
pos	at first I had the reaction a lot of people left with after seeing this : that shots of fat people sunbathing , etc were cheap shots in a way . OK so he 's doing diane arbus meets . . . whatever . . . but it was n't long before I realized that this was n't being done in a dehumanizing way , as the images unfold I felt that the problem was entirely the audience 's : we are conditioned by Hollywood and also movies from just about everywhere actually to feel that to watch people above a certain age behave in a sexual way is something unseemly , something that ought not to be shown . if this were all the film offered it would be a great deal . however , the story of the woman with the abusive boyfriend and his drunk friend really hits like a ton of bricks : very eloquent storytelling , incredible performances , and to think the scene was improvised . that blonde guy is a genius actor . finally I want to contradict those who say this film is all about how pathetic all these people are . the old man who is on the make with the woman who finally dances for him is completely an a OK character that breaks that mold , so do n't oversimplify the film by overlooking him . yes his dog gets killed . this ai n't a rosy picture of the world but it 's not . . . completely hopeless . anyway I felt really grateful to the filmmaker for making such a beautiful film all in all . I would n't say each of the threads were as strong as the strongest , but I say this movie basically kicks ass and would highly recommend it . . .
neg	After just 15 minutes into this film , I began to miss Zhang Yimou 's earlier , more weighty films that looked at the politics and society of China from unique perspectives . His turn to martial arts films was a serious misstep in my humble opinion . Hero was his worst film since Operation Cougar , with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that found in a John Agar film . Shi Mian Mai Fu is no different . As an American who has been studying Chinese films for a few years now ( and understands and can speak some Mandarin ) , I 'm sure my opinion is different from many others as I 'm coming from a different background . SMMF , like Hero , is not really a traditional a kung fu film , and it 's certainly not a wuxia pian film . There are no sword & sorcery or chivalry elements here . This is a completely different vehicle than infinitely more watchable films such as A Chinese Ghost Story ( all 3 ) , The Butterfly Murders , Green Snake , et al . While those all featured charismatic leads who looked like they were actually enjoying what they do , SMMF features bland , and sometimes laughable , dialogue combined with cardboard acting . Zhang Ziyi plays a blind person about as well as Ben Affleck . There 's an air of superiority with this film that 's really quite insulting . It takes itself so seriously , it just becomes a huge joke by the end . All the actors look as though this is the most important piece of celluloid in history , they destroy any chance of actually conveying emotions , and the complete humorlessness of it really makes you wonder if Zhang Yimou was making a film per se , or simply a showcase ( i.e. an " ego booster " ) for Zhang Ziyi . The camera is literally making out with her face and she gets sexually assaulted not once but twice in the film . Her acting range really has n't extended past her ability to play a naive " w"itch . She 's so concentrated on her acting , she comes across as cold and lifeless , as though she 's reading her lines from a notecard . It 's so funny to hear American critics and film people ( like the completely clueless Quentin Tarantino ) call this film a masterpiece . I guess if they see a bunch of Asian actors on screen looking really important while flying through a bamboo forest , they 're tricked into thinking it 's brilliant film - making . Ching Siu Tung 's choreography , while still retaining his trademark style , editing , and postures , lacks the vitality and originality of his earlier films like A Chinese Ghost Story , Dragon Inn , and Duel to the Death . Sadly to say , the wirework in this film is really subpar , and if there 's subpar / obvious wirework , then you probably should n't have filmed it at high speed . The same goes for the special effects which have a distinct B - movie feel to them . Beans , daggers , bowls , arrows , swords , and other random objects fly through the air ( after being thrown ) with no regard for logic , turning , climbing , and banking as though there 's a little pilot inside . I know that logic does n't really hold a place in stylized Chinese martial arts films , but if you do n't want to induce a mass amount of giggling from your audience , then you should probably work on your compositing a bit more . Mass melodrama , unintentionally funny dramatic moments , boring fight scenes , really uninspired plot twists are what await you with Shi Mian Mai Fu . It 's obvious that Zhang Yimou is no longer making movies for Chinese audiences . This is meant to crack into the Western market just as CTHD did . After watching Hero and SMMF , I 've come to the conclusion that if Zhang Yimou wants to make Hollywood films , he 's definitely off to the right start . SMMF is basically The Phantom Menace of Chinese martial arts films . And I thought Hero was bad .
pos	Steve Carell once again stars in a light romantic movie about choices , family and pressure . By judging on the plot and cover art of the movie I was expecting a flat - out comedy , lots of laughs and unrealistic elements , but I guess I was wrong . Sure the movie had some comedy , but it felt much more of a light Drama to me and Steve Carell once again gave a great performance . The movie itself really tackles true observations and that was a strong element I found . But , the ending felt a little bit rushed and predictable . Through - out , the cinematography was great , the acting was great and the message it delivered was obvious but yet still very important . Though , it came down to old , flat and predictable ending . I 'd reckon if different choices were made at the end of the movie ( perhaps for the bad , even ) this movie would get better publicity . Still a fun movie .
neg	The Lack of content in this movie amazed me the most . First i though that people was going to compare this to Rock On ! but i 'm really surprised myself to say that this was worst than Rock On ! So - so story Horrible cast Ajay Devgan Jamming with Salman Khan and Asin you got ta be kidding me . The music was Okay Khanabadosh was the track of the movie the rest was bad ! Vipul Shah has n't still learn from Singh is King 's critically bashed comedy . Now Asin .. where do she come from sorry for Asin 's fan out there but she suck*d big time in this movie seriously bad acting she did n't look good at all overdose of make - up ! My final verdict go watch Aladin with your family instead wasting your time here .
pos	Had fun watching this film .. despite the feeling I got a lot of the time , that this film was almost copying Monsters Inc. There 're quite a few things that are extremely similar between the two , the relationship between an animal / monster and a small child , other animals trying to break that relationship , etc . It felt like that pretty much throughout the film , to me . One of the redeeming features though , is Scrat :) Very very funny character , even if he serves no purpose :)
neg	' Succubus ' , the edited version of ' Necronomicon Geträumte Sünden ' , is a struggle to sit through , even at a lean 76 minutes ; any more of this dreadfully boring and pretentious Euro horror tripe and I may have slipped into a coma . Jess Franco once again delivers a truly awful piece of 60s trash that appears to have been made by a cast and crew out of of their heads on Class A hallucinogenics , since not one second of this mess made any sense whatsoever . Apparently , this is one of the better of his 180 + films  it 's hard to believe that there are worse efforts out there . The unfathomable plot deals with Franco 's usual themes of sex , violence and lesbianism and throws in a bit of S&M for good measure , and yet it still manages to remain mind numbingly tedious . I may leave it quite a while before entering the world of dodgy Euro Horror again  life is too short to be spent watching bilge like this .
pos	In some ways , The Wrath of Kriemhild surpasses Siegfried 's Death , but it also loses some of that film 's greatness . The plot of this one is more cohesive than the first , which is quite amazing . The second half of the actual poem is a lot sloppier and a lot harder to tread through , until , that is , you get to the climactic battle scenes ; only the Iliad 's are better . Lang and Harbou embellished the Huns . The poet - compiler of the Nibelungenlied did n't know a Hun from his right ball , and as a result they are , more or less , the same as the Burgundians in custom . For example , although the poet clearly describes Etzel as a heathen ( which is Kriemhild 's main concern as Rudiger tries to persuade her to marry him ) , when she gets to Hunland , the first thing she does is go to mass . The Huns here are clearly heathens ; they 're almost like caveman . The depiction of them is hilarious , especially Verbal , the jester , who has two marvelous scenes . Etzel 's character has been given more weight . He is much more formidable . All he does is bemoan his fate in the original poem . Lang and Harbou are masterful at building suspense , especially at the banquet scene , which is intercut with Verbal 's second performance to an amazing effect . However , as is the nature of this half of the poem , the film 's amazing technical accomplishments are missing in this one , for the most part , except for a dazzling sequence where Etzel 's hall burns down with the Nibelungs inside . The one thing I do have to object to is the way Harbou changes the ending . SPOILERS : in the poem , after Hildebrand captures Hagen and Gunther , they are imprisoned . Kriemhild visits Hagen in his cell and demands that he reveal where he has hidden the horde . He refuses and she herself decapitates her brother . When Hagen still refuses , she decapitates him . Hildebrand ( or possibly Dietrich ) is so disgusted that a woman would presume to murder a great warrior that he , in turn , decapitates her , calling her a " Devil Woman " . Etzel , who is much weaker in the poem than he is here , says something silly like : " Ah me ! " I can understand why they would want to keep a unity of time and place as Hildebrand brings them from the castle ; to retain the prison settings of the two deaths would make the film very anticlimactic . I also understand why they did n't have Hildebrand kill Kriemhild : his character is much reduced here ; his name is only mentioned once . But , to have Kriemhild kill herself , adopting Brynhild 's death from the Icelandic sources , is just catering to the audience instead of challenging them . The point of the poem is that Kriemhild 's wrath goes far beyond it should into the realm of pure evil . Here , we simply have her die for her lost love . It 's not as interesting .
neg	Most of the French films I 've seen - and enjoyed - were more talk than action , but that 's okay . I found them interesting , well - photographed and with intriguing actors . ( However , I did at one point wonder if Gerald Depardieu was in every French film ever made ! It seemed that way . ) This movie has the same interesting visuals and had a good opening . But then it became talk , talk and more talk .... which is fine for a drama but not for a murder mystery . After awhile , I almost fell asleep watching this . Actually , the film was more like a play with almost all the scenes played out in one room . Thus , if you love plays , you should like this ... but I want a little more bang for a murder story .
pos	WHEN I first saw this film , in London , in 1958 , I was bowled over . I had never seen a film like this before . It had a strange , hypnotic effect , quite unlike the films that I had seen previously and it left a lasting impact . I believe that Odile Versios & Marina Vlady are sisters , if not twins . Certainly the interaction is amazing in its power to influence the viewer . If this has been converted to DVD - in Region 2 format - and in the original French language , I would love to hear about it & where it can be purchased .
neg	Proof why Hollywood conventions are in place . Stale dialogue , underdeveloped and flat characters and a disjointed storyline are only part of the problems with this gangster classic wannabe . An attempt to be daring and different but this appears to be a slap - together attempt at recreating the magic of Arthur Penn 's Bonnie and Clyde ( 1967 ) and George Roy Hill 's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid ( 1969)- truly innovative filmmakers and films - but falling well below the bar . Problems with storylines being self - explanatory result in the need for a voiceover to explain problem sections . The editing appears again to be an attempt to duplicate the previous classics but is occasionally disjointed and cause more problems for me technically . Unnecessary shots are thrown in to justify the filming of them but would have better served the viewer by sitting on the cutting room floor . Stills , black & white montages and period music are thrown in from time to time in attempts to either be different or to cover up for scenes that ca n't transition well or to replace scenes that just did n't work at all and again are reminiscent of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid ( 1969 ) . Overly dramatic pauses between sentences , random shots of surrounding scenery that was n't needed for storytelling plus over - the - top acting of bit players and supporting actors was reminiscent of the backyard camcorder directors of the late 1980 's - I was left wondering who was in charge of this film during production and during post - production . The playing of music in most two shots and close - ups and then suddenly stopping in wide shots overly emphasized a weak musical score . No sound editing was drastically apparent as the bulk of the film was gunshots , doors , footsteps and dialogue ( a style used in the late 60 's through the mid-70 's by new directors ) but lacking background noise causing it to seem artificial - particularly the tire squeaks on dirt roads . In my honest opinion the biggest problem of all is there are no ' likeable ' characters for the audience to route for nor were we lead to see as the protagonists of the story . Neither the gangsters nor the lawmen were characters I wanted to see win and neither were focused on as the ' hero'- a necessity for any story to work for me . We know from Penn 's and Hill 's movies who the ' heroes ' are . Even though they are criminals , we like them and want to see them get away . I could care less who was on the screen in this film . I got the impression that John Milius was trying to give off a non - historically accurate reenactment documentary of the events surrounding John Dillenger 's life from June 1933 to July 1934 ( his death ) . To be fair , there are some moments of good solid storytelling , which are moments that shine forth brightly from the dark and dismal canister in which this film sits . John Milius gets better thankfully in future films where he does n't seem to try to ' copy ' other filmmakers . Dillinger ( 1973 ) is n't a total waste as many stars and famous faces who were at the cusp of breaking out are involved with this directorial ' big budget ' debut , but wait for it on a classic movie channel rather than spending money to rent or buy .
pos	I have to say that this was not very exciting but talk about fashion and weird ways to solve a mystery . A little too simple , Nancy Drew ( Emma Roberts ) uses IMDb ... that 's fantastic ! I really liked about that part of the movie ... Corky ( Josh Flitter ) is however extremely hilarious ... and Ned Nickerson ( Max Thieriot ) seemed really hopeless ... he should have been more angry with her for how she has treated him ... Alright , this movie is tour and fashion in disguise . Anyhow , I recommend this movie , just for summer fun . Encore Nancy , just for fun . More teen spy movies by Emma Roberts .. Spymate ... remember ? She 's becoming good at this tricky detective work .
neg	This is the first Guinea Pig film from Japan and this is the sickest , in my opinion . A bunch of guys torture a girl for several days before finally killing her . And at this point , I will say that these films are NOT real ! They are faked horror films which try to be as realistic as possible . The scenes are sickening but also unrealistic in many cases . For example , when they kick the girl in the floor , we can clearly see how they kick and stump the floor near the girl ! And how stupid this looks ! The sound effects are also unrealistic and do n't make sense . Other scenes include animal intestines thrown on the girl , the girl exposed to loud noises for many hours , the ripping off of fingernails , worms placed on the wounds in the girl 's body , the eye pierced and mutilated in horrific detail and stuff like that . Very sick and mean spirited film and has absolutely nothing valuable or cinematically significant . This first entry is the sickest and most amateurish Guinea Pig , although it is not as bloody as the next part , Flowers of Flesh and Blood , which tries to be as shocking as possible . Guinea Pig : Devil 's Experiment is perhaps the sickest thing I 've seen and the closest thing to snuff there is . This is still ( of course ) faked s(n / t)uff , the only difference to genuine " snuff film " is that no one dies or hurts for real in this film . I can not recommend this to anyone since thi s is so s****y and repulsive . They who consider this is a great horror film understand nothing about cinema and the real meaning of it . I watched this as a curiosity ( as the other parts in the series ) and now I know how insignificant trash these are . They work only in shock level and that 's not too valuable cinematic achievement . Devil 's Experiment is perhaps the sickest film I 've seen and Mermaid in a Manhole ( Guinea Pig 4 ) is perhaps the most disgusting film I 've seen . So these are pretty extreme in my book , but that 's all they are .
pos	First than anything , I 'm not going to praise Iñarritu 's short film , even I 'm Mexican and proud of his success in mainstream Hollywood . In another hand , I see most of the reviews focuses on their favorite ( and not so ) short films ; but we are forgetting that there is a subtle bottom line that circles the whole compilation , and maybe it will not be so pleasant for American people . ( Even if that was not the main purpose of the producers )   What i 'm talking about is that most of the short films does not show the suffering that WASP people went through because the terrorist attack on September 11th , but the suffering of the Other people . Do you need proofs about what i 'm saying ? Look , in the Bosnia short film , the message is : " You cry because of the people who died in the Towers , but we ( The Others = East Europeans ) are crying long ago for the crimes committed against our women and nobody pay attention to us like the whole world has done to you " . Even though the Burkina Fasso story is more in comedy , there is a the same thought : " You are angry because Osama Bin Laden punched you in an evil way , but we ( The Others = Africans ) should be more angry , because our people is dying of hunger , poverty and AIDS long time ago , and nobody pay attention to us like the whole world has done to you " . Look now at the Sean Penn short : The fall of the Twin Towers makes happy to a lonely ( and alienated ) man . So the message is that the Power and the Greed ( symbolized by the Towers ) must fall for letting the people see the sun rise and the flowers blossom ? It is remarkable that this terrible bottom line has been proposed by an American . There is so much irony in this short film that it is close to be subversive . Well , the Ken Loach ( very know because his anti - capitalism ideology ) is much more clearly and shameless in going straight to the point : " You are angry because your country has been attacked by evil forces , but we ( The Others = Latin Americans ) suffered at a similar date something worst , and nobody remembers our grief as the whole world has done to you " . It is like if the creative of this project wanted to say to Americans : " You see now , America ? You are not the only that have become victim of the world violence , you are not alone in your pain and by the way , we ( the Others = the Non Americans ) have been suffering a lot more than you from long time ago ; so , we are in solidarity with you in your pain ... and by the way , we are sorry because you have had some taste of your own medicine " Only the Mexican and the French short films showed some compassion and sympathy for American people ; the others are like a slap on the face for the American State , that is not equal to American People .
neg	Movies like these are to the originals what Album Oriented Rock stations are to what music used to be like - repetitive , boring , and drained of all the original energy by a committee of corporate drones . I AM glad that Aragorn was n't typecast as an expectant psycho by this P.O.S. Go back and watch the 1971 version , count the things that would NEVER be included in a modern version , and thank whatever deity you worship that someone somewhere in the distant past had the balls to write and shoot an original concept movie that was n't based on someone else 's ideas , and was n't passed through a corporate board before it saw the light of day .
pos	This is the Who at their most powerful . Although before the masterwork Who 's Next , which would provide anthems like Baba O'reily and Wo nt Get Fooled Again . This film shows the group in transition from mod rockers to one of the biggest live bands of the 70 's . Daltrey shows what being a front - man is all about , Entwistle steady as ever .   Moon is great , check out the ongoing conversation with the drum tech , and see him playing " side saddle " whilst having a bass drum head replaced ! Townsend even looks like he 's enjoying himself occasionally ! Considering they took to the stage at 2 am no one in the crowd was asleep !   There are not many bands these days could produce a set as tight as this and it is difficult to imagine any of the bands of today producing a concert that in 36 years time will be be enjoyed as much as this one .
neg	The idea had potential , but the movie was poorly scripted , poorly acted , poorly shot and poorly edited . There are lots of production flaws ... for example , Dr. Lane 's daughter who never ages despite the passing years . Wait for video , but do n't expect much .
pos	I do n't think that many films ( especially comedies ) have added memorable , quotable dialog like MOONSTRUCK . I wo n't illustrate it - you can see a remarkably long list of quotes on this thread - but any film that can make subjects like the defense of using expensive copper piping rather than brass for plumbing purposes into memorable dialog is amazing to me . It is not the only line that pops up and makes an imprint on our memory . How about a restaurant waiter who regrets a planned marriage proposal because it will mean the loss of an old bachelor client ? Or a nice , elderly dog fancier encouraging his pack to howl at he moon ? Or Perry ( John Mahoney 's ) description of a female student 's youthful promise as " moonlight in a martini " ( my favorite line ) . MOONSTRUCK is a wonderful example of brilliant script , first rate direction , and a good ensemble cast that fits perfectly . There are other examples ( the drama THE OX - BOW INCIDENT is another example , but a grimmer one ) . Cher , Olympia Dukakis , Vincent Gardenia , Nicholas Cage , John Mahoney , and Danny Aiello are all involved in plots and cross purposes that examine the nature of love , and how to handle it . Is it a good thing to be totally in love ? Cher and Cage , at the end , seem to think so , but Dukakis knows that real love drives the individual crazy ( and Cage gets a glimmer of realization of this too , when he and Cher argue outside his home after they return from the opera La Boheme ) . Is infidelity by men a way of avoiding thoughts of death . Dukakis believes so , and ( oddly enough - although he is not totally convinced ) Aiello . Chance reveals infidelity - Dukakis realizes early that Gardenia 's odd behavior is tied to unfaithfulness , and Cher literally stumbles onto Gardenia and his girlfriend at the opera ( but Gardenia also stumbles onto Cher 's similar unfaithfulness to Aiello ) . But chance also causes misunderstandings : Fyodor Chaliapin stumbles on Dukakis walking with John Mahoney and thinks that she is having an affair . There are lovely little moments in the film too . Cher 's observation about flowers leading to receiving one . Her hearing the argument in the liquor shop and it 's resolution . But best is the sequence of Louis Guss and Julie Bovasso as Cher 's uncle and aunt Raymond and Rita Cappomaggi and Rita 's charming and kind comment to Raymond about the effect of the moonlight on him . It is the sweetest moment of the entire film . It is close to a flawless film . After seeing it over a dozen times in as many years I can only find two points that do not seem as smooth as they should be . When Cher is at Cage 's bakery , his assistant Chrissy ( Nada Despotovich ) mentions how she is secretly in love with Cage , but has been afraid to tell him . Earlier she was slightly snippy towards Cher , who put her in her place quickly . Yet nothing seems done with this potential rivalry . At the same time , the fact that Cher forgets to deposit her uncle and aunt 's daily business profits is brought in momentarily in the concluding seven minutes of the film - but just as quickly dropped . Was there supposed to be some plot lines that were dropped , besides one about Cher and Vincent Gardenia working at a homeless man 's shelter as penance ? It is a small annoyance , but I think it is just based on a desire to see more of this film because it is so very good .
neg	This film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures . Sure , the effects are laughable , the story confused , but just watching Hasselhoff in his Knight Rider days is always fun . I especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in , it added to what little suspense was mustered . Give it a 3 .
pos	The Dirty Harry series began with very gritty cop action , and was almost immediately lightened up for " Magnum Force " . By the time that " The Enforcer " rolled around , Dirty Harry was little more than a television cop show ( saved only by Tyne Daly ) . After a break of seven years , Dirty Harry has finally gone back to his roots . Maybe he 's been gone for too long this time . Clint Eastwood makes the first well - directed Harry film since Don Siegel made the first , which helps considerably . Harry is a darker character once again , not the nice cop he had become . He can once again say things like " Go ahead , make my day " and really mean it . " Sudden Impact " is a true Dirty Harry sequel . " The Enforcer " should never have been made . 7.2 out of 10
neg	" How She Moves " springs to life only when its high - energy , talented cast members are kicking up their heels and strutting their stuff for the camera . Otherwise , this stale strive - suffer - and - succeed story is low on energy , low on originality , and low on anything that might make the movie stand out from the dozens of other , likeminded films that have come before it . Rutina Wesley has modest appeal as the academically gifted inner - city youngster who finds that the best way to raise her private school tuition money is by entering step - dance competitions , but both she and her fellow actors are poorly served by uninspired screen writing and undistinguished direction . As noted earlier , the movie achieves some spark when the performers are up on stage dancing , but such moments are far too few and sadly fleeting .
pos	Cinderella is a beautiful film , with beautiful songs of course . In fact , it 's one of the best films of the 1950 's . I think all the characters are portrayed amazingly . You can see the cruelness of Cinderella 's stepsisters and her stepmother , the sweetness of Cinderella . The mice are funny and sweet too . I think they changed the tale a bit , but I think it 's for the best . It 's such a nice film , and I do n't think anyone could resist it deep down . I give it a 8/10 . I do n't think it 's the best Disney film . But it sure is a true classic .
neg	Difficult to call The Grudge a horror movie . At best it made me slightly jump from surprise at a couple of moments . If one forgets the ( failed ) frightening dimension and looks at other sides of the movie , he is again disappointed . The acting is OK but not great . The story can be somewhat interesting at the beginning , while one is trying to get what 's happening . But toward the end one understands there is not much to understand . " Scary " elements seems sometimes to have been added to the script without reason ... So ... ( yawn ) See this movie it if you have nothing more interesting to do , like cutting the carrots or looking at the clouds .
pos	I admit I had no idea what to expect before viewing this highly stylized piece . It could have been the cure for a zombie virus or the common cold for all I knew . It began with great visuals , little snippets to grab your attention and cause your imagination to run wild . As it continued I learned quickly through voice overs what was taking place . A nice little neo noir story that I felt was not a waist of a few minutes of my time . The little clues given to the audience through visuals at the beginning give them a sense of accomplishment as they piece together the plot . Along with a nice twist at the end its a cool package overall . The score , though not bad , gave the film almost a music video feel . It just felt a little dated , not adding anything to further the storyline . Some of the performances felt overly dramatic but fit perfectly with the feel of the overall piece . I walk away from this very satisfied . I was given a lot of information in a short period of time but through great editing and voice - over work it did n't feel rushed or pushed . Great job !
neg	A previous reviewer said the movie is not all that bad . What ? ! ? ! ? ! The movie glorifies child molestation . Oh , but Sylvia Kristel was naked in it , so let 's give it 5 out of 10 stars . Why not a full 10 ? Because the filmography was " agonizing , " the child 's looks of shock were " unrealistic , " and the fat friend was " irritating . " Nowhere in the review does the reviewer express any outrage that an American movie in 1981 featured scenes of a child having sex with a grown woman . I happened to catch this steaming loaf of a movie while staying at a hotel that had Showtime . To me , even if the fat friend had acted up a storm and was a deserving of an Oscar , I would still have to give the movie only 1 star . That TV 's Howard Hessman starred in the movie at the same time as he was appearing in WKRP is particularly ridiculous . But do n't take my word for it !
pos	I loved this film , at first the slick graphics seemed odd with the grainy footage but I quickly got into it . There must have been thousands of hours of footage shot and I really admire the work done in cutting it down . If you 're easily shocked by drugs or violence it might not be the film for you but there are some great characters here , ( and some real tossers ) . Technically I liked it a lot too , they must have used a new de - interlacing algorithm or maybe it was just that the footage looked so dark anyway but I was n't annoyed by the usual artifacts seen in video to film transfers . ( Open Water drove me nuts , mostly because there are cheap , progressive cameras available now and I see no excuse in not shelling for one if you intend to screen in the cinema ) . Sorry that 's my own little rant . I definitely recommend this film if you 've ever been involved with the music scene , it has some tragic moments but most of it is hilarious , I might be accused of laughing at others misfortune but it 's a classic piece .
neg	Despite much style , flash , and glitter , this French musical fails to speak . The tunes are repetitive , predictable , and tedious . The story is uninteresting , as are the many characters .   People break into song and dance , without motivation or reason . Most of the cast wears phony looking wigs and hairpieces , and the sets look hopelessly studio bound . To be honest , this video of the restored version was stopped before the end , so negative an effect it had on me . Certainly a shame , to have such a multi - talented cast in so feeble a final effort .   Goes to show , I guess , where followups ( in this case , to the great classic , " Umbrellas " ) often do go awry . One can not recapture , only recreate .
pos	And Gi Joe go stuck in the water , I die of laufther every time I see this movie , and then a big brown shark came , This is comedy at it 's best , this blows away the kings of comedy and anyone else , Andrew Dice Clay , Jerry , Tucker , Rock , They ca n't thouch the man the myth the legend Eddie Murphy , Yo EDDIE WE WANT MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
neg	Garson Kanin wrote and directed this look at " modern day " Las Vegas and the gap between generations , his first directorial effort since the 1940s ! David Janssen is somewhat miscast as a big - shot casino owner who reunites with his son ( Robert Drivas , who looks disconcertingly like an older Jason Bateman ) . Janssen approaches every scene the same way : defensively , with a chip on his shoulder . Playing this role cool and laid - back is asking too much from Janssen , who barks at everyone like a grouchy put - upon husband ( he even chews out Don Rickles and makes him cry ! ) . His son , a ne'er - do - well in search of his own identity , makes hip comments about how young people look down on Vegas ( give them another ten years ) , and his disapproval of Dad 's lifestyle causes friction . Brenda Vaccaro is cute as a self - conscious secretary and Edy Willaims has a fun bit as a showgirl at an audition . Unfortunately , " Where It 's At " does n't have much else going for it other than the now - dated ruminations on ethics between adults and their kids , some quick T&A shots and amusingly jaded satirical bits on the high - stakes world of gambling -- most of which has been covered by now , ad nauseum . * * from * * * *
pos	12 year old Arnald Hillerman accidentally kills his older brother Eugene . His feelings are arrested by the fact that his family can not interact with him ( or feel it is not the right thing to do ) . His ONLY refuge is his grandfather , who is the ONLY one who seems to have compassion on him . The Realism will captivate " true-2-life " movie lovers , but will not satisfy those that desire action & thrills .
neg	I appreciate a think positive feel good about yourself film , but this is too much . In the end they look like a bunch of loonies . This film is one of those finding yourself 70 's plots , I know the film is made in 1980 . A lot more of Clint and girl friend movie . This movie is a 3/10 .
pos	Once in the Life means that once a hoodlum , always a hoodlum , and nobody gets in or out of ` The Life ' for free . Neighborhood hoodlums in New York sell drugs and run scams because they ca n't make it in the legitimate world , maybe because they have a criminal record , or a drug habit , or because they 're just lazy . This simple story with a couple of twists about mostly despicable characters manages to draw compassion out of the audience for its main players because of their loyalty and compassion for each other . The film is written , produced , and directed by Laurence Fishburne , who also stars as 20/20 Mike ( all hoodlums have nicknames ) , and is based on his play , ` Riff Raff . ' It feels like a play from beginning to end , especially during the longest scene where the three main players square off to decide who can be trusted . Often times the dialog comes very fast , much faster than it would on stage , and I think it 's the film 's biggest flaw . Mixed in as flashbacks throughout the film are poems from the street , a sort of iambic pentameter rap , that is violent and evocative of the world this movie discloses . The poetry makes it difficult to dismiss these men , these hoodlums who murder , cheat , and betray each other , as unworthy of our attention or below our contempt . The disturbing thing about this film is that its realism shows us not only how these people live , but how they suffer for the same reasons as us all . One is too stupid , another a junkie , and the last suffers from conscience while the audience wonders , or even laughs , at the irony of executioners demanding from him hanging in the gallows to tell jokes in the midst of his demise .
neg	... they bothered making this movie ? Anyone ? I did n't think so . If you are looking for a coming - of - age movie , go rent Summer of ' 42 . This is no Summer of ' 42 . When your big stars are Nolte & Sarsgaard , & Sarsgaard gets more screen time , that is your first warning sign And , of course , for such an " artsy " movie , there is plenty of cursing & skin flung around , just to make it look " artsy " . Sarsgaard did his usual uninteresting , cardboard character , punctuated by moments that were supposed to be intense . The intensity is that of someone with bi - polar disorder . Miller is most famous for her looks & what she had to say about the city of Pittsburgh after this movie . Pittsburgh SHOULD hold a grudge against her . She misrepresented an actual Pittsburgh native . Foster gave Sarsgaard a run for his money in the cardboard acting style . Wow ! Was this his first role after high school graduation ? So , we have this weird triangle . Foster has a crush on Miller , but is with his boss / girlfriend . He ca n't take Miller to bed , & wo n't take his boss to bed . So , he hangs with Sarsgaard & Miller , & watches them get it on . Then , after one of Sarsgaard 's pseudo - intense moments , Foster & Miller get it on , a scene that we are " treated " to in every sloppy , moaning detail . Finally , just to round it all out , Foster & Sarsgaard get it on , with Foster in the Miller role . Now I know how 2 guys get it on ( as if that was ever anything I needed to know ) . After all that , all that 's left is the tragic ending for one character & the retrospective views of the remaining 2 . It gets me right in the pit of my stomach . Oh , wait ! That was the pepperoni pizza I just had . I 'd like back the time this movie took out of my life , please .
pos	I have found this movie available for streaming on Netflix and thought I 'd give it a try . The plot revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor ( Colm Feore and David Cubitt ) who have finally seen each other after their father has passed away . Ryan and Theo at first argue about who did what . But later , Theo finds out that his brother Ryan is not only gay but he is dying of a terminal illness . So , Ryan and Theo spend their time patching up their differences . This is such an incredible film . I have only seen Colm Feore in Season 7 of 24 but he was phenomenal in this . David Cubitt , an actor I have NEVER heard of before did a phenomenal job as well . I would recommend this to those who are interested in the Gay and Lesbian genre . This is one movie you do n't want to miss . I give this film 10 stars out of 10 . Excellent film !
neg	Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here I was looking forward to watching this film . Bad mistake . I 've seen 950 + films and this is truly one of the worst of them - it 's awful in almost every way : editing , pacing , storyline , ' acting , ' soundtrack ( the film 's only song - a lame country tune - is played no less than four times ) . The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme . Rarely have I been so happy to see the end credits of a film .   The only thing that prevents me giving this a 1-score is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort . One for Keitel obsessives only .
pos	Mesmerizing , breathtaking and horrifying , this hauntingly beautiful film is the " Apocalypse Now " without fiction . Slow in pace , quiet in mood , it gives good glimpses of the poisoned patches of Earth that may well be signs of an inevitable doom . There is no doubt in my mind -- the nature is plagued and we are the disease . Greed , the very essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress , has turned us into something like cancer , on its way to consume the host and die with it ... Manufactured Landscapes is quite an unforgettable viewing experience - at least I 'll never regard my toaster and iron the same way again .
neg	Absolutely one of the worst movies I 've seen in a long time ! It starts off badly and just deteriorates . Katherine Heigl is woefully miscast in a Lolita role and Leo Grillo manfully struggles with what is essentially a cardboard cutout character . The only cast - member with any enthusiasm is Tom Sizemore , who hams it up as a villain and goes completely overboard with his role . The script is dire , the acting horrible and it has plot holes big enough to drive a double - decker bus through ! It is also the most sexist movie I have ever seen ! Katherine Heigl 's character is completely unsympathetic . She 's seen as an evil , wanton seductress who lures the poor , innocent married man to cheat on his wife . It is implied throughout the movie that she 's underage , and the message that accompanies that plot - strand just beggars belief ! At the end , she is n't even able to redeem herself by shooting the man who 's obviously ( ha ! ) become demented with rage and guilt , but the script allows him to kill himself , thereby redeeming himself in the eyes of males everywhere . Horrible . Do n't waste your time .
pos	It helps immensely if one is familiar with the culture and time period in which this film takes place . First of all , these ladies are NOT geisha , they are oiran ( prostitutes)in the Yoshiwara - type " green houses " , circa 1860 , give or take .. This should help clear up some details which may be confusing to the unaware . The film deals with issues of loyalty , love and , perhaps most importantly , how people deal with adversity , both their own and that of others in their immediate environment . That plus the outrageous photography together with the hauntingly beautiful music , make for a lovely ride . Just plug it in , suspend your disbelief and enter their world . You wo n't be disappointed .
neg	I 've read reviews that apparently you have to have been a student in a very strict , British school in the 1960 's to understand this . Maybe that 's true , if so , then this movie is outdated . * * * * * * * * * * * * * SPOILER ALERT * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * The ending makes about as much sense as all the kids who 're anti - government and anti - corporation without having any better solution that does n't torch society to a Mad Max type cinder . Yeah , the main characters could leave , but they do n't . The reasons they go about this do n't make sense . There is n't enough character development to explain why . What shooting up a bunch of innocent people is supposed to mean is never explained or even hinted at . It is mentioned that war is the final creative expression , quite possibly the only revelation that any characters of this movie have , and it makes no sense . The characters who go on a murder spree are n't fighting the institution , they 're just killing people . I thought they might 've used all the explosives to blow up the place or at least the sanctuary at the end , that would 've made greater symbolic sense , but they did n't . tl;dr - This movie is an adolescent 's daydream of fighting against authority that plagues them , though in reality they need . It has no moral , symbolic truth , or meaning to it ; this movie simply plays out the fantasy of killing teachers and people in " power " that annoy you . If you think a murder rampage/ school shooting similar to columbine or virginia tech is a rational and sensible way to deal with teachers and institutions you do n't like , then I guess you 'll love this movie . If you 're like me and you 're working towards making a life for yourself instead of just blindly ( very blindly in this movie ) rebelling against " the man " , this movie is juvenile and boring . You can also tell in parts that funding was lacking , and the story seemed to have a touch of attention deficit disorder . All in all , this seems like a very rough draft of what could 've been an okay movie , but no effort is put into the dialogue , character development , or moral so it 's just ... poorly done . If ... only I could get my two hours back .
pos	I think the majority of the people seem not the get the right idea about the movie , at least that 's my opinion . I am not sure it 's a movie about drug abuse ; rather it 's a movie about the way of thinking of those genius brothers , drugs are side effects , something marginal . Again , it 's not a commercial movie that you see every day and if the author wanted that , he definitely failed , as most people think it 's one of the many drug related movies . I , however , think something else is the case . As in many movies portraying different cultures , audience usually fully understands movies portraying their own culture , i.e. something they 've grown up with and are quite familiar with . This movie is to show what those " genius " people very often think and what problems they face . The reason why they act like this is because they are bored out of their minds :) They have to meet people who do mediocre things and accept those things as if they are launching space shuttles on daily basis . They start a fairly hard job and excel in no time . They feel like- I went to work , did nothing , still did twice as better as the guys around me when they were all over their projects , what should I do now with my free time . And what 's even more boring ? When you can start predicting behavior not because you 're psychologist , but instead because you have seen this pattern in the past . So , for them , from one side it 's a non challenging job , which is also fairly boring sometimes , and from another they start to figure out people 's behavior . It 's a recipe for big big boredom . And the dumbest things are usually done to get out of this state . They guy earlier who mentioned that their biggest problem is that they are trying to figure out life in terms of logic ( math describes logic ) , while life is not really a logical thing , is actually absolutely right .
neg	I was expecting to love this movie -- film noir , serial killer , dark irony . I was baffled by many choices the characters made ( " Hey , I know they 're creepy looking , but let 's hook up for a cross - country road trip anyway ! " ) , found the pacing to be glacial , and the emphasis on moody lighting to take the place of original thought by the director and cinematographer . Thinking about it now , this would have been a much better movie if someone had just run the script through the common sense - o - meter ( 1992 model ) before starting to film ...
pos	I 've spent years looking for a copy of this film(16mm , dvd , vhs ) , so I could show it to my kids . The movie is funny , and Spike and the members of his band show why they were the best musicians in the business . They had to be that good to play that demented . I like it and recommend it for movie lovers of all ages . The movie is about a turn of the century firehouse , with a crew of misfits that are firemen and the department band ( when not fighting the fires ) . There 's the usual running gags , plus the mayhem of Spike Jones and his Orchestra . Also , comedy relief provided by comedian Buddy Hackett and straight - man Hugh O'Brien .
neg	Return of the Boogyman is a dreadful movie which does n't play like a movie , it plays like an episode of a TV sitcom when they flashback to older episodes . Return of the Boogyman is just a clip show . Mutch of the film is constant and annoying flashbacks from the first movie . Over and over again the same footage . How boring this is . The movie really is about a psychic woman who has visions of the first movie . I have seen the first movie I do n't want to see the same scenes over and over again and I do n't know who would . The whole movie looks like it was quickly made to make a few bucks and that s it .
pos	I discovered this film after reading the book that inspired it . It is not a strictly biographical film ; it is " loosely based " on the facts . But I found it a compelling and eerie exploration of evil and madness , and Michel Serrault gives an unforgettable performance as Dr. Petiot . There are many memorable images in this movie ; Petiot traveling through the night like a vampire , his black cloak flapping behind him , is almost iconic . There are also several touches of expressionism - Petiot 's crooked silhouette mounting the stairs leading from the cellar where the butchered remains of his victims await cremation , reminds me of some scenes from ' Nosferatu ' . But I found the primary appeal of this movie to be aural . The soundtrack is loaded with ominous sounds , starting with the foreboding music of the opening credits , accompanied by wordless wailing . Petiot lives and runs his medical practice in a complex with many small shops , and there is a persistent background noise of knives being sharpened somewhere , as well as a peddler playing eerie tunes on a saw . There are animal noises as well - the concierge keeps a goat , unseen cats howl - and later in the film we see hapless cattle being herded through an underpass . The whole atmosphere is unsettling , with overtones of violence and slaughter . Not only animals , but human voices are often heard - the screams of Gestapo victims , Petiot 's patients in his waiting room , monitored by a listening device , just the same as the suspected collaborators after the war are monitored in their cells . Even the action of the film is often arranged so that we hear the voices of the participants without seeing them - when Petiot goes to see Mme Kern , we hear her singing as she works , her voice echoing in the theater , before we ever see her . And even when she does appear , she is often filmed from behind , her voice calling out to her husband , whose voice calls out to her in conversation . Disembodied voices echo in large halls , and their owners , when seen at all , are photographed at a distance , so we can not actually see them speaking . This is a ghost story , and these are the voices of ghosts - many of them Petiot 's future victims . Yet Petiot himself is often only a voice ; his frightening laughter echoes as he retreats from the camera , throwing comments behind him or into the air to nobody . In a way , he is as much a ghost as those he murders . He is always frantically busy , scurrying from appointment to appointment , never at rest . But his activity is that of a machine - lifeless and imperturbable . It is interesting that among all the horror and danger of occupied Paris , Petiot alone is unafraid ; he is amused , enthusiastic , angry , irritated , contemptuous , but never afraid , unlike those real people he lures to their deaths . It is no surprise that he boasts of his mechanical inventions , including a perpetual motion machine ( a true detail from the book - he did claim to have invented many machines ) ; he is a sort of perpetual motion machine himself . And mechanical imagery is everywhere in the film , from the opening giant wheel in the movie house , to Petiot 's bicycle ( with its squeaking wheels echoing the sound of sharpening knives ) , to the Victrola he keeps winding up to play music before he makes a kill . Even his routine with his victims is mechanical - write a note to your wife , let me disguise you before you leave , you need a vaccination , Barcelona , Casablanca , Dakar - like a well - oiled machine , the routine is always the same , just as the record is always the same . Maeder , the author , says that it was the clockwork perfection of his crimes that weighed so heavily against Petiot at his trial . His system was as smooth and efficient as a Nazi concentration camp , and this may be why the movie invents a subplot of Petiot 's involvement with the French Gestapo and the occupying Nazis . Unfortunately , it does n't quite work as part of the story , because it 's very hard to figure out just what Petiot is doing for the collaborators , or what is going on when he ends up at their headquarters in the middle of the night . Disposing of bodies ? Hiding stolen goods ? It 's hard to say , and harder to believe ; it 's not likely the state would turn to a freelancer like Petiot . But it does remind us of the duality of evil people ; Petiot is a robber and a murderer , but he is also a devoted father and husband . Just as we learned that Hitler loved dogs , and that Nazis guilty of the worst war crimes could also be loving fathers and family men , so we have to recognize that Petiot could commit unspeakable horrors and yet also function normally . His insanity is easily camouflaged by the insanity and horror of the wartime situation in Paris ; when killing , robbing and disappearing are happening all around , nobody pays attention as Petiot tosses more corpses on the pile .
neg	Oh ... my ... god ... this is without a doubt the absolute cheesiest movie I have ever seen . The acting is bad , the story is weak , the characters are weaker , and the whole film just does n't make sense . Couple this with mediocre directing , really strange scenes ( such as the one where the kid reaches over the ravine and mysteriously falls in ) , and thoroughly abysmal dialog ( " Look ! " " Musta peed his pants ! " ) , and you get one complete failure . Not to mention the fact that the only thing Mr. Atlas looks like he could defeat is a case of chocolate bars . But this is part of the movie 's charm . Sit down and watch it with a few of your friends for a good laugh .   I love this movie , because it 's just SO BAD !
pos	Two movies back to back which dealt with Indian POWs ; Veer Zaara and Deewaar . Although Veer Zara was a love story of a guy who gives everything up for someone , Deewaar focuses on the main subject itself . It is not hidden that many Indian POWs are rotting in Pakistani Jails for years - for whom neither Indian Govt . has time or sympathy nor the other side . I 'm sure some of Pakistani POWs are in India as well , but let 's focus on the movie . Full of actors . Some were stage actors like Raghubir Yadav , Rajendra Gupta , etc . Amitabh Bachchan who plays the role of a Major , acted well . Akshaye Khanna did his part well . There was nothing for Amrita Rao to do than a few giggles and couple songs . I think Sanjay Dutt 's role was most solid even though it was n't too long . He acted really well here and his dialog delivery was also impressive . If you compare it to LOC , which was nothing but a day long movie with story going in all directions ( if it HAD a story ) - Deewaar is a well directed movie that keeps a good pace and does justice to all actors . 7.5/10
neg	I am sorry to say that it was one of the worst films I 've ever seen . Although visually fascinating ( e.g. the use of colour was absolutely stunning ) , it was pretty boring and disturbing ( see the father / son incest ) . What 's more , music is totally absent , and if you think of those wonderful soundtracks by Michael Nyman ( who wrote the soundtracks for most of Greenaway 's films ) then you can imagine what a difference it makes .
pos	Or released on DVD or screened on a cable channel like Amer . Life TV network . I have been watching another favorite , " Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea " , as well as " Lost in Space " and Land of Giants " . They 've been showing them forever but are n't receptive to suggestions for other shows . My father and I were big fans as I was already a big science / electronics nut , ( still am ) and my father was an old school chum of Nader . They both attended Oxy together . I still have memories of several of the episodes even though I was only 9 . More so than any show that old . I think it was televised on Sat . after " Bonanza " . Some of the episodes I recall are the one where he takes the experimental drug that slows down action . Or the one where he body surfs the big ones , ( I did that too ! ) Or the one where there was a mine cave in and he conveys how to use mind control to have the trapped people slow their breathing by entering a trance - like state . That is the one show that I wish I could see again . I got my wish with the original " Outer Limits " and " Sci - Fi Theater ... John
neg	Is there any other time period that has been so exhaustively covered by television ( or the media in general ) as the 1960s ? No . And do we really need yet another trip through that turbulent time ? Not really . But if we must have one , does it have to be as shallow as " The ' 60s " ?   I like to think that co - writers Bill Couturie and Robert Greenfield had more in mind for this two - part miniseries than what ultimately resulted , especially given Couturie 's involvement in the superb HBO movie " Dear America : Letters Home From Vietnam " which utilized little original music and no original footage , letting the sights and sounds of the time speak for themselves . This presentation intercuts file footage with the dramatic production , but it does n't do anyone any favours by trying to do too much in too little time ; like so many of its ilk , it 's seen from the point of view of one family . But the children of the family seem to be involved tangentially with almost every major event of the ' 60s ( it 's amazing that one of them does n't go to the Rolling Stones gig at Altamont ) , making it seem less like a period drama and more like a Cliff Notes version of the decade . The makers rush through it so much that there 's little or no time to give the characters any character , with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time - the children 's father is especially clichéd - and then when they 're back on BLAMMO ! it 's something else . Garry Trudeau could teach the filmmakers a thing or two about doing this kind of thing properly . In fairness , Jerry O'Connell , Jordana Brewster , Jeremy Sisto , Julia Stiles and Charles S. Dutton give their material the old college try , but they 're wasted ( especially the latter two ) ; it 's undeniably good to see David Alan Grier in a rare straight role as activist Fred Hampton , and Rosanna Arquette ( in an uncredited cameo in part 2 ) is always welcome . What is n't welcome is how " The ' 60s " drowns the soundtrack with so many period songs that it ultimately reduces its already minimal effect ( and this may well be the only time an American TV presentation about post-60s America never mentions the British Invasion - no Beatles , no Rolling Stones ... then again , there 's only so much tunes you can shoehorn into a soundtrack album , right ? ) . Capping its surface - skimming approach to both the time and the plot with an almost out - of - place happy ending , " American Dreams " and " The Wonder Years " did it all much , much better . Nothing to see here you ca n't see elsewhere , people ... except for Julia Stiles doing the twist , that is .
pos	Elmer Fudd is laughing while lounging in his easy chair and reading his comic book , his dog comfortably nearby sleeping in front of the fireplace . All is peaceful until a flea comes bouncing by . ( The flea is dressed in a farmer's - type outfit with a big sombrero and is carrying a satchel with the name " A. Flea " on it . ) He gets out his telescope and spots the dog . ( We see a big shot of the dog 's butt and the flea whistles in excitement , screaming " T- Bone ! " He then sings , " There 's food around the corner ; there 's food around the corner ! " ) That sets up the storyline of this cute - but - obnoxious flea tormenting the poor dog . The mutt is hilarious as he reacts to the flea .   The drawings of his huge teeth chomping right next to the fleeing flea are clever and the dog 's dialog made me laugh out loud a few times . This might be the funniest canine I have ever seen in a cartoon ! The poor pooch , under a threat of having to take a bath , as to NOT react when the stupid flea causes him pain . It 's almost painful to watch as the flea uses pickaxes , jackhammers and the like on the dog . He puts firecrackers in the dog 's behind . It 's brutal !
neg	I do n't believe there has ever been a more evil or wicked television program to air in the United States as The 700 Club . They are today 's equivalent to the Ku Klux Klan of the 20th century . Their hatred of all that is good and sweet and human and pure is beyond all ability to understand . Their daily constant attacks upon millions and millions of Americans , as well as billions of humans the world over , who do n't happen to share their bigoted , cruel , monstrous , and utterly insane view of humanity is beyond anything television has ever seen . The lies they spout and the ridiculous lies they try to pass off as truth , such as the idea of " life after death " or " god " or " sin " or " the devil " is so preposterous that they actually seem mentally ill , so lost are they in their fantasy . Sane people know that religion is a drug and should n't let themselves get addicted to that type of fantasy . However , The 700 Club is in a class by itself . They are truly a cult . While I believe in freedom of speech , they way they spread hatred , lies , disinformation , and such fantastic ideas is beyond all limits . I hope that one day the American Psychiatric Association will finally take up the study of those people who delude themselves in this way , people who let themselves sink so deeply into the fantasy land of religion that they no longer have any real concept of reality at all . Treatment for such afflicted individuals is sorely needed in this country , as so many people have completely lost their minds to the fantasy of religion . The 700 Club though , is even more horrible as it rises to the legal definition of ' cult ' but due to The 700 Club 's vast wealth ( conned daily from the millions of Americans locked in their deceitful grip ) they are above the law in this country . For those of you who have seen the movie " The Matrix " you know that movie was a metaphor for religion on earth : the evil ones who are at the top of each of the religions who drain the ones they have trapped and cruelly abuse for their own selfish purposes , and those millions who are held in a death sleep and slowly being drained of their life force represent those many people who belong to religions and who have lost all ability to perceive what is really going on around them . In less civil times , the good townsfolk would have run such monsters as those associated with The 700 Club out of town with torches and pitchforks . But in today 's world where people have lost all choice in their choices of television that is presented to them , we have no way to rid ourselves of the 700 Club plague .   The television ratings system and the " V " chip on TV 's should also have a rating called " R " for religion , so that rational people and concerned parents could easily screen such vile intellectual and brutal emotional rape , such as presented by The 700 Club every day all over our country , from themselves and their children .
pos	A strong woman oriented subject after long , director Krishna Vamsi 's Shakti- The Power , the Desi version of the Hollywood hit Not Without My Daughter is actress Sridevi 's first home - production . A story about a woman 's fight against harsh injustice . The story of the film revolves around Nandini ( Karisma Kapoor ) who lives in Canada with her two uncles ( Tiku Talsania , Jaspal Bhatti ) . There she meets Shekhar ( Sanjay Kapoor ) , falls in love with him and they soon marry . Their family is complete when Nandini has a boy , Raja ( Master Jai Gidwani ) . But their happiness is short lived , as the news of Shekhar 's ailing mother ( Deepti Naval)makes them leave their perfect life in Canada and come to India . And that 's when the problems start . From the moment they reach India , both are shocked to see the pollution and the vast throngs of people everywhere . They take a crowded train to reach Shekhar 's village and when they finally reach the station , they have to catch a long bus drive to his village . The filthy sweaty bus combined with the uncertain terrain makes it a never - ending drive . And unfortunately for them , a frenzied mob that beat Shekhar out of shape for no fault of his attacks their bus . Fortunately , they get shot dead just in time before they can further harm him . After that , they drive to the handing Havel where Shekhar ' 's father , Narsimha ( Nana Patekar ) lives with his wife ( Deepti Naval ) . Nandani realized that her father - in - law is in command as soon as she enters the place , but her only solace is her mother - in - law 's warm welcome . Living there , Nandini learns of her father - in - laws tyrannical behavior and realizes that ruthless killing is a way of life for him . The day she sees her father - in - law teach her son to throw a bomb , she loses it and lashes out against him , insisting to Shekhar that they move back to Canada . But terror strikes again when Shekhar is murdered one day , leaving a broken down Nandini alone with her son in this strange land where she is harrowed by a cruel father - in - law . Her fight against this man to save her son is what makes up the climax of this emotional heart - wrenching film . What sets apart Shakti from most films being made off late is also the rural setting of the movie . The only drawback is Ismail Darbar ' 's music , which fails to rise above the script . The only saving grace is the sexy item number Ishq Kameena , which has been composed by Anu Malik . Another pat for the director comes because he has extracted some splendid performances from his cast . Karisma Kapoor is the life of the film and has given a moving performance as a helpless mother . She is sure to win awards for this heated portrayal . Second is actor Nana Patekar who is back with a bang with this film . His uncouth mannerisms suit him to the hilt and he 's shown his versatility once again with this role . Sanjay Kapoor is the surprise packet of the film with a sincere and effective portrayal that stands up against both the other actors . Deepti Naval too is in top form and her Pr - climax showdown with Nana is praiseworthy . Shahrukh 's cameo provides the lighter moments and surely he 's been pulled in to get the required star value . Though his role was not really required , he 's done it well . Overall , Shakti is a far superior film than most churned out these days and the Pr - release hype is sure to get it a good opening . Shakti is sure to get the critics and audience thumps up . So what if the film needs to be desperately trimmed by at least 2 reels to better the impact . Shakti still has the power to go on without a hitch !
neg	do not be suckered into renting this movie . It has nothing to do with an escape from death row , despite the ( english ) title . I ca n't think of a single good thing to say about the movie . Poor acting , poor editing , poor directing ... laughable " plot " , and the sound / music was so irritating , it 's a wonder this movie does n't come with a warning label . The only possible way to sit through this movie and enjoy it is for it 's historical cheesiness quality . They just do n't make films this bad anymore .
pos	Peaches is truly a marvelous film . I write this to refute a review from someone called ' Auscrit ' , that has appeared on this site . First of all the idea that either Monahans first film ' The Interview ' is somehow TV is an extraordinary statement . Here is a film that has been significantly praised around the world as is simply one of the best Australian Films ever made . It fully deserved to win best picture . Peaches is a brave , bold and courageous departure . For me it works on every level and I have now seen it twice . Monahan is a filmmaker who is demonstrating great skill and incredible sensitivity . For ' Auscrit ' to make the comment that it is another TV movie etc and that Hugo Weaving is no good simply does not ' get ' the film . Or more particularly does not want to get it . Frankly it is the sort of comment that one expects from either another filmmaker who is jealous or bitter or both . Or someone from inside the industry either distribution , exhibition or bureaucracy . Your average punter , I have found just does not write comments like that . I have noticed other comments on the site and reference to the film Sommersault . One has to wonder what people think they are looking at . Unfortunately in Australia at the time SS was released the push was , if you did not like it then there was something wrong with you not the film . This manipulation of the media is pretty common down under . The reality is the only similarity between the two films are that they are rights of passage films . Unfortunately for me SS is a film about nothing , that could have been told in 15 minutes . I see it as a one dimensional film about anxiety . Peaches in comparison is a master piece . Personally I can not wait to what Monahan does next as he is clearly way ahead of any of his contemporaries when it comes to cinema . In conclusion if the film does not win all at this years AFI 's and IF awards , then it is a rigged game . As for Auscrit , please find something more constructive do with your time
neg	This movie is so , so , so horrible , that it makes angels lose their wings . Shaq had tried to make other crossover efforts , like his work in Shaq - Fu for the NES and his plethora of unbearable rap albums , and later , the epic serving of horrible film - making that is Steel . There 's not a single good thing to be said about this movie . I saw it a bunch of times when I was very young , but I must 've been an idiot then , because this movie takes all that is enjoyable about films and tears it apart . It 's fun to mock . I saw it on the Disney Channel a while back and spent a few minutes doing that . Although , once the thrill of mocking it is done , you still become overwhelmed by its terribleness . If you see it on TV , try this : consider , as your watching the film , removing from it all the scenes in which Shaq uses his magical genie powers . If you do that , it becomes like a film about a pedophile chasing a kid and rapping to seduce him . That 's kinda funny , and disturbing . A horrible example of film . Do not , unless looking to mock it , see this movie .
pos	Lock Up Your Daughters is one of the best high - spirited comedies I have ever seen . It is misunderstood since it lacks the " social commentary " values that many films of the day ( 1969 ) required to be successful . The characters are over - the - top satires of everyday people and played to that purpose by all of the actors . Christopher Plummer shines especially bright as Lord Foppington , a noble with hair too big to fit in the door . The plot involves the usual 18th century stuff ; mistaken identities , thwarted romances , corrupt government officials , and jokes at every turn . It answers the questions : What happens when 4 rambunctious , eager to party sailors are on leave in a small British coastal town ? And , who do they get involved with and how does it all turn out ? Despite doing poorly at the box office , it has great costumes , excellent music(based on the Mermaid Theatre musical of the same name ) , great , lively acting and sets that are obviously authentic . That it has never been released on either VHS or DVD is truly a shame , since so many bad movies are released every day .
neg	I attempted to watch this film without being able to really sit through it , for while it is suppose to have a " good " message ; the problem is that it is obviously produced according to one particular interpretation of scripture . An interpretation , in my opinion , will mislead a lot of people . In addition , I am a movie maniac and the acting in this film was completely unacceptable . Never before had I wished for a negative score to rate a movie . So , if you wish to be preached to incessantly by those without authority , then by all means , get this film . This comment is also a warning to people who like or love scifi , because the title will deceive a lot of people as well . This was an unfortunate film , because the basic idea had possibilities and those possibilities were squandered . The film 's only redeemable quality is that it did make me realize that the character in the " Time Machine " probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future .
pos	Excellent story about teenagers , leaders , high school football " stars " . How far will you go to protect your friends ? Lie , kill ? How much can You lose if you stud by an innocent girl ? Can love beat the odds ? Can you defeat narrow - minded small town people ? When your friend scores and you " lose " , will you do everything in your power to make her pay for it , or will you be a man about it , and respect her right to chose ? Will you rape her and show it as your victory over a " problem " girl ? Can you stand by the one who 's only sin is to have an opinion of her own , to be able to make her own decisions , to chose for herself ? It made me think twice before giving my judgment about who was right and who was wrong , but one is for sure - very disturbing movie and theme in general . Thumb up !
neg	As others have pointed out this movie is a load of pretentious drivel for the mindless or masochists . We all know after seeing trainspotting and acid house that Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world . But unlike trainspotting and acid house without a good dose of humour or gritty realism movies like this do not work . And even more importantly without a decent script a movie will not work and there is nothing new , inspiring or thought provoking about the script for this movie . The fact that this movie won a couple of Bafta 's shows how bad the British film industry is at the moment . I thought the Aussie movie industry was pretty bad at the moment but unfortunately the British industry is even worse . This movie is so bad I would n't even bother renting it from the weeklies section . Do yourself a favour and give this movie a wide berth .
pos	Superb movie . Very good photography of 1969/70 Bolton , which seems now to be a different world . Thoughtful and an excellent dramatisation and production . James Mason a real first class star . It is and I would agree with the above comment that this movie is a national treasure .
neg	I really wanted to like this movie a lot more than I did . That 's because I love wacky foreign comedies -- particularly the strange ones that catch you completely by surprise . However , although this one frequently caught me by surprise , these were almost never pleasant surprises . It reminded me of South Park in that nearly EVERY social norm was violated until the only ones left to broach were too sick to be funny . For example , after exploring adultery , drug abuse ( of nearly every sort -- ranging from pot , heroin , speed to glue sniffing ) , prostitution , S&M , suicide , murder , etc . , the movie got to the hilarious ( ? ) topic of pedophilia . Mom encouraged her one son ( who looked about 12 years - old ) to sleep with neighboring men . In fact , at one point in the movie she gives this boy to the dentist in lieu of payment for dental work ! Funny ? ! You 've got to be kidding . This movie just goes too far and delves into the " black hole of comedy " . What should they make fun of next , cancer or rectal tumors ?
pos	Skip McCoy ( Richard Widmark ) pick - pockets Candy 's ( Jean Peters ) wallet which contains an important microfiche that is intended for the Communist cause . She is being followed by 2 federal agents that are waiting to pounce once she hands the microfiche over to her contact . However , Skip steals the purse on the subway under everyone 's noses and so starts a hunt for him by both the police and Joey ( Richard Kiley ) and Candy who want the microfiche back . Skip can only be traced through Moe ( Thelma Ritter ) who sells information on criminals . It is made clear to Skip that what he has stolen is important and both sides want the film , but he intends to hold out for a high price . This leads to Joey hunting after him and a conflict between Joey and Jean , who has fallen in love with Skip . Joey has a deadline to deliver the microfiche to his boss .   Its a well - acted film and it has a good beginning that gets you involved straight away . Its a bit unrealistic how Jean Peters immediately falls in love with Widmark , but this point is necessary as otherwise why would she later hold out from Joey . Its a good film .
neg	This movie is now my gauge against which all other movies will be compared ... as in , " was it as stupid as Revolver ? " I too was in the Toronto International Film Festival audience last night where a room filled with over 2000 people walked out in an eerie silence after being absolutely dumbstruck by 2 hours of sheer nonsense . Jason Stratham would have been amazing if only he had a purpose . Within the first 10 minutes he 's given a proposition by Andre 3000 and Big Pussy ( of Soprano 's fame ) which makes NO SENSE AT ALL ! Then there 's some shooting and then there 's Ray Liotta wearing embarrassing bikini briefs , then there 's some animation , Ray Liotta 's naked butt , lots of shooting , teeth gnashing , art house wanna be pretensions and more of Liotta 's embarrassing body that elicited laughs at every showing ... which I 'm not quite sure was the reaction he was looking for ... not 5 times anyway . Everyone in this movie thinks they 're smarter than the average bear and Guy Ritchie thinks he 's Yogi Bear incarnate . The story lines might have went nowhere but the posturing was outta sight ! The only way this movie could have been worse is if Madonna herself was in it .
pos	I lived during those times and I think the program caught the heart of the era . I do think it should have dealt with more of the Afro American issue but I think it cover a lot in the program . It was scary to sit and watch the riots on T V hoping that they would not go as far as your families home and that it would not get burnt down . I thought Jerry O'Connell did a great job portraying a vet coming back from the war . I went to school with guys who came back . Some had changed more than others and some not so much . It bothers me when someone comments that an issue was not covered enough or it was not entertaining enough . Live through it and then make comments . I thought the movie was great and that everyone in it did a remarkable job . Thank you for a trip ( sad and good ) down memory lane .

pos	I do n't understand your objections to this movie . It is a taut , thrilling extension of the character created in " Basic Instinct " . The only part of the story that is the least bit unrealistic , is the fact that Sharon Stone 's character is still alive and not in jail at this late date . SPOILER ALERT : As the movie progresses , we are presented with three theories of what is going on : 1 ) Sharon Stone 's character is killing all these people because she 's crazy ( Risk Addicted ) ; 2 ) David Thewlis ' crooked cop is killing these people in order to frame Sharon Stone 's character ; 3 ) David Morrissey 's analyst is killing these people for revenge . What upsets most people about the movie seems to be that none of these theories are ever explicated as the " real " story . ( Although the analyst is in a psychiatric care facility for killing the cop ; the only killing that occurs on screen . ) I think this is a brilliant plot device in the spirit of " 2001 , A Space Odyssey . " WHO CARES what is real ? The blonde really is crazy , the cop really is crooked and the analyst really wants revenge . What 's important is the interactions between these and other characters in the story . Like real life , everyone is more complicated than anyone thinks and reality is more complicated than a movie . Get over it !
neg	I agree with most if not all of the previous commenter 's Tom ( bighouseaz@yahoo.com ) . The Zatoichi series is a great character study combined with great sword fighting and excitement . I have seen Zatoichi 1 - 13,15,16 ; I believe 14 has not been released on Zone 1 ( usa ) . Zatoichi the Outlaw was disappointing . The story line was complicated , and seemed to be a hodgepodge of many previous Zatoichi story lines . At one point , I was wondering if I was not seeing a remake of a previous Zatoichi film . This film was disappointing because it started to depend on effects ( a head rolling , limbs severed , blood ) and less on the nobility of the Zatoichi character . All the previous films succeeded based on the storyline and action , and won a great following without having to resort to effects . I am just hoping that the remaining Zatoichi films do NOT follow the same trend . This is the first Zatoichi film from his studio . I highly recommend all the previous Zatoichi films -- and recommend them .
pos	If one would see a René Clair film with the kind of distracted semi - attention which is the rule in TV watching - one might be better off doing something different . Watching " Le Million " with all attention focused upon what takes place before eyes and ears will reveal a wealth of delightful details which keep this musical comedy going from the beginning to the end with its explosion of joy . In the Danish newspaper Berlingske Tidende a journalist once wrote : " In my younger days I saw a film which made me feel like dancing all the way home from the cinema . This film is on TV tonight - see it ! "
neg	Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball , especially her autobiography . I 've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic , ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi . I could write a whole list of factual errors , but it would go on for pages . In all , I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply can not be portrayed by anyone other than themselves . If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi , Jr. , I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film . The filmmakers tried hard , but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me .
pos	A well - made and imaginative production , refreshingly free from cliché , this somewhat picaresque affair recounts a tale of a close friendship that develops between a man and a boy under less than ideal conditions : the man an escaped convict who has kidnapped the youth for his value as a hostage . Expertly directed by Alan Gibson with a fine sense for balanced narrative movement , the film provides freshness in nearly every scene , as felon Martin Steckert ( Richard Harris ) , believing that his rejection for parole was particularly undeserved , contrives a convoluted but ultimately successful escape plan , following which his spontaneous nature comes to the fore as he flees to the lakeside residence of his childhood . Often bursting into song or dancing a few steps , the capricious Steckert gradually gains the trust and affection of his captive and , as police close in for an inevitable showdown , the tethered pair are seen to be a great deal alike in their responses to forms of rejection , as discerned by a psychiatrist ( Lindsay Wagner ) assigned to aid a zealous police lieutenant ( James Coburn ) who is in charge of the manhunt for Steckert and his " prisoner " . This is an engrossing story , worth telling , a quickly - paced and novel adventure that profits from a capital performance by Harris , fine turns from Wagner , Coburn , and Karen Black , along with Justin Henry as the snatched lad , with an appropriately whimsical score contributed by Wilfred Josephs , and top - notch cinematography by Frank Watts , with all footage shot in a beautiful autumnal Ontario province .
neg	Elephants Dream was supposed to be the flagship project of the open source community . And while it was a very interesting idea in concept , in reality it has failed miserably . The film is beautifully rendered , which is probably the only redeeming factor . A huge problem with them , however , is the vast overruse of light bloom . It 's horrible , although I guess it helps give the film a dreamlike quality . One thing to note is the terrible voice acting . While Proog 's voice actor is at least semi - competent , Emo 's voice actor is HORRIBLE . I guess when you have a budget that basically amounts to zero , you ca n't afford to hire real voice actors . To me it seems like they hired one of the animators to do his voice . As a whole , the movie does n't really go anywhere . To me it seems like it 's more of a " look what we can do " kind of movie instead of a real film . The plot goes nowhere and fails at really showing any interesting point . The whole movie feels like it was made as an excuse to make interesting looking areas . Overall , it may be worth a quick download from the official site , but do n't expect anything except pretty graphics .
pos	The acting in this movie was superb . As an amateur rocketeer , I found very few mistakes . As a human being , it touched my heart and soul . To watch the actors , you would think that they are the actual characters . Laura Dern , a favorite actress of mine , left nothing out of her performance . The young actors playing the Rocket Boys showed talent beyond their years , especially young Homer . Homer 's father inspired that eternal love / hate relationship between a father and son so that it felt real . If you do n't get a lump in your throat or shed a tear when that first successful rocket goes up or when father and son come to terms , then get your pulse checked ( you may be dead ) .
neg	This review applies for the cut of the film that 's generally available as " Fury of the Wolfman " . I understand there is an uncut version out there with additional footage , and I would hope that it contained at least eight or nine crucial scenes that seem to be missing from the cut known as " Fury of the Wolfman " . In short , the movie makes absolutely no sense whatsoever . It is utter nonsense , and incomprehensible nonsense at that . Waldemar Daninsky , that venerable lycanthropic antihero portrayed by Paul Naschy in a seemingly endless series of films , is apparently a normal guy who has just come back from a trip to Tibet , where he was attacked by a yeti . Somehow this has turned him into a werewolf . Daninsky is a doctor , a scientist , and an instructor at what appears to be a college . One of his female colleagues , Ilona Elmann , is involved in a vague form of hypnosis ... "Chematodes " , a nonsense word used to refer to a bunch of wires attached to a victim 's head . Ellman feels this will enable her to " change the direction of the human brain " , naturally enabling her to rule the world , provided she can get us all attached to those wires with no trouble . Elmann is also into werewolves , because she kidnaps Daninsky and takes him to her hidden laboratory . She has a bunch of other people trapped there as well . Some of them look like gypsies , and are chained up , being in varying states of lucidity . Others are clearly hippies . Elmann feels that one day she may be able to " help them be human again " ( ? ) , but in the meantime she controls them with her chematodes . Waldemar becomes her hairy hit man , wandering around like a werewolf zombie -- that is until the filmmakers decide to use footage spliced in from another Naschy werewolf film , " Frankenstein 's Bloody Terror " ( do n't ask ) , at which point Naschy 's werewolf makeup changes considerably and he lurches around like an animal . Is this making any sense ? No ? Good . That 's the film 's saving grace . It does n't try and engage you on any kind of intellectual level , it just goes full speed ahead with whatever nonsense dialogue or cheap horror movie sets it can muster up . " Fury of the Wolfman " may be the best Halloween party movie ever . You absolutely do not need to pay attention to it , and in fact if you do , you will be completely confused .
pos	I 've often wondered just how much CASPER was meant for children ... with all the issues revolving around his identity ( in this film we are lead to believe that he is the spirit of a dead child , as his home is a cemetery plot ) , as well as the disturbing message brought by this particular film . Maybe Casper was meant more as a morality play , or Famous Studios felt like breaking new ground in ' reality ' cartoons . THERE 'S GOOD BOOS TONIGHT is a well - animated project - no doubt there . But , the plot development involving the fox ( who becomes Casper 's friend , but meets a tragic end ) is a concern . Give Famous Studios credit -- they tackle death with respect ... but , the stark image of Casper 's mourning is rather graphic and disturbing for children ( though the denouement does offer a happy ending , but I wo n't give away the ending ) , and the violence is rather steep , even for 1940 's standards . This might be a good cartoon for parents to use in helping explain death to children -- but I would n't pop it into the VCR for a perky cartoon break .
neg	96 minutes of this is cruel .. and I love the old Munster 's . Yes , the plot is thing ; yes the lines are trite ; but whoever was at the helm of this was not a fan . There is so much ' intrigue ' ( and I use that word with great pause ) that I wonder if it 's an old Starsky & Hutch episode . I lost count of the number of times I noticed that makeup had missed a spot near the collar . Refusing to acknowledge that any time had passed since the mid-60 's ( ludicrous ) the producers simply replace Marilyn & Eddie with younger actors . Why not let them grow and age ? The addition of an Addam 's Family style reunion does not add to the flavor of the Halloween Party . Grandpa & Herman fly to Transylvania and back in a few hours ( preposterous . ) Sid Ceaser is the most , yes the most unbelievable character ( I am including the bad robots ) since he babbles an unwild combination of gibberish & yiddish but claims to be an ancient Arabic ruler . And yes , it looks like the laugh track is missing . In fact , there are several spots where there is dead air , as if the laugh track was to be inserted later . The actors seem to wait on the faux audience . It 's not laughable ; it 's sad . Oh , and the best part ! Yvonne DeCarlo has a line that just goes to show you how out of touch the writers and producers were . Marilyn says something like : " Where could Uncle Herman and Grandpa be ? They could have been in an accident . They could have been hit by a car ... or a train ! " Lily says responds with something like : " You 're Uncle Herman will be here if he has to drag himself off the train track . " What 's amazing about this is : Yvonne DeCarlo 's husband was a stuntman in the early 60 's and lost a leg and was nearly killed in a train stunt . He never recovered and this financially devastated her family . ( check out Biography 's fantastic review of her life and career ) This line could have been easily changed to be more sensitive to her . If you are a real fan of the Munster 's then you 'll have to RENT this mess . It illustrates how some things are better left alone . Even with the ( nearly ) original cast , this is almost as bad as the attempted remake of the show a few years ago .
pos	Like others , I have seen and studied most of the books and films concerning the Clutter Killings , including a few dramatic works thematically based on the actions and psycho - mythology of the participants to the crime -- including Capote himself . As to Capote , I can not forgive him for willfully withholding Perry Smith 's confessions , intimacies and writings from even the defense counsels . I believe truths and facts Capote " reserved " for his " book , " which required for Capote two guilty verdicts and capital punishment , would almost certainly have sustained a successful insanity defense for Perry Smith even under the old McNaughton Rule . Capote himself could never write another major literary work after " In Cold Blood . " Shame and guilt . In my opinion , he willingly encouraged and planned the brutal capital punishment to provide the spectacular ending he required for his book / drama . To him , both men HAD to die for his book to succeed . The book had to justify itself by pretending it was about the horror of capital punishment . His actions and silence assured that ice - cold conclusion . Capote 's book is not truth . It is not factual or journalistic . It is drama and melodrama spiced with his own creatively psychotic imagination . What most people consider the virtues of the contemporaneous first movie are stark images of Capote 's mind , which may have been the most cold - blooded aspect of all . No wonder viewers ironically but necessarily prefer Blake 's performance . That actor IS the nightmare from Capote 's dishonest imaginings . So who is to say how the two killers should be played ? Who is to judge what could make an essentially poetic psychotic snap from excessive courtesy and kindness to " do it now " killing ? I agree with the few who see in Eric Roberts ' work a magnificent performance , Shakespearean in its range , yet played with heartbreaking sincerity . Anthony Edwards takes a much safer " attitude mode " to create a smarmy Hickok ; but he is one - dimensional and boring , with only a few notes in his television range . Roberts is almost four - dimensional , adding physical weakness and agony to a powerful animal body , a Frankenstein Creature who thinks in poetry and knows exactly what NOT to do . Like Leopold apropos Loeb , Robert 's Perry Smith is hopelessly in love with an evil man . Without Hickok or a man of his particularities , Perry Smith would not have brought his psychotic mind into a world of horrors . He fears himself more than he fears anything else in life . Given the freedom from Capote 's death grip on the consciousness of the Clutter killings , Roberts and Edwards are free to create original personalities and psychoses to craft a different and new production of the drama . Same facts , some of the same lines from the case record , but deeper , more complex , with clearly titanic psychotic stresses -- indeed Roberts is so good at this fluidic madness that he physically and facially demonstrates in every moment how little awareness he has of where or who he is . What many of our reviewers dislike about this film , Roberts in particular , is that cold - blooded killing is n't shown the way they expect and have been manipulated to demand . That is because here we are seeing a far more profoundly realistic " interpretation of life and death " than Capote could ever create -- a real Tragedy . The actual cold - blooded killer , Mr. Capote , and his hypocritically artistic " non - fiction novel " do not control these interpretations and performances . If " In Cold Blood " and Capote 's effect on life , literature and truth matters as much as scholars say , then it takes guts as well as talent to portray the truth , or a version of the truth , that is not the rank , cowardly lie drawn up from the fathoms of Capote 's own abyss .
neg	What this movie fails from answering is how wrong this war is ( and most US wars recently made only to get some oil ) . How many innocent civilian casualties there has been , how many lives perished and how blatantly stupid the perpetrators are . So , let me ask you - if American soldier kills women and children apart from enemy , its OK , but if government accidentally kills their own forces by deadly chemicals while killing many civilians as well , it is not ? Your logic fails , gentleman . I 'll give it 5 for the solid performance and 1 to everything else , 3 in total .
pos	I grew up in Royersford , Pa. The town where Jerry 's market was . I remember my whole family going out to watch the filming . I remember a guy showing the " Blob " to me and my brothers in a bucket . I also would like to share that my mother was in the movie . Her hair style was the same as Aneta Corsaut 's and she was ill one evening and they saw my mom and asked her to sit in the car with Steve Mcqueen for some shots from behind . They payed her $ 25.00 and gave her a story to tell until she passed away this past August . My mom was not a teenager and she was a few months from giving birth to my little sister .
neg	The Little Mermaid is one of my absolute favorite Disney movies . I 'm sorry to say , however , that Disney completely messed up when they made this sequel . I 'll admit it has some good points to it . The songs are n't bad , and the animation is clean and clear . There is some humor , I 'm sure -- I do n't remember , because after watching it I immediately banned it from appearing before my eyes again . The worst point of this movie is the plot . In this movie , Ariel becomes her father . She forbids her daughter to go near the sea ( yes , out of fear ) , just as she was forbidden to go near the land . I personally think that , given her past , Ariel would maintain some of her headstrong ways and not treat her daughter like she herself was treated . Besides this fact , Ursula was replaced by a non - scary , pathetic sort of sea witch ( the underfed , forgotten sister ) who is more comical than scary . She , too , has some little underling to do her bidding -- but she 's not scarier or worse than Ursula . Ursula spoiled us with her believability for badness . This sea witch is a joke . To make matters worse , Flounder is a fat , deep - voiced father ( no longer the cute guppy we all know and love ) and Eric 's voice is not even done by the same actor ( something that always annoys me in a remake / sequel ) . ( His voice difference was very obvious to me , by the way ! ) I felt that the only reason this movie was made was so that Disney could catch a few fast dollars , something I hate to think about a corporation I actually really do enjoy . I felt that this plot lacked imagination . I know that this act ( child following in the footsteps of a parent ) happens , but Ariel was different . That was what we loved so much about her . She had a dream , she fell in love , and she made that dream come true . Until she appeared in this movie , that is . Then she became just like the other adults . This is n't the Ariel I know . And I do n't like her . I know of some children who have enjoyed this film , and I know some adults who did n't mind it , either . But for me , and for all of you out there who have the utmost love for Ariel , please do n't see this movie . The Ariel we know dies within , resurrected only for a song or two and one final scene that actually is n't bad ( where she accepts the water back again)--although she takes very little part in the ending , regardless .
pos	Casting Jack Cassidy as Ken Frankin was sheer brilliance . Cassidy personified arrogance , confidence , charm and wit - all with a condescending , evil little smirk on his face . In my opinion , Jack Cassidy is by far the best murderer ( having appeared three times ) in the Columbo series . This particular ( and first ) performance , is my favorite Columbo episode ever - hands down . A fresh faced Steven Spielberg did amazing camera work ( yes , there were a couple of camera shadows on the actors at times)capturing the nuances and banter at different and intriguing angles between Columbo and Franklin . Also , the panoramic and tight in shots at Big Bear Lake , CA ( Franklin 's cabin home ) were very impressive . If you have not yet seen this episode , then you owe it to yourself to do so - it 's a true masterpiece . Jack Cassidy was a very talented actor and singer . His charismatic personality was highly infectious . His death in 1976 , at age 49 was very sad and indeed very tragic - he surely had his best years ahead of him . Rest in Peace Jack , you will live on for eternity through your great work .
neg	PROBLEM CHILD is one of the worst movies I have seen in the last decade ! This is a bad movie about a savage boy adopted by two parents , but he gets into trouble later . That Junior can drive Grandpa 's car . He can scare people with a bear . He can put a room on fire ! It is a bad movie as much as BATTLEFIELD EARTH . A sequel is an even worse fate . Rent CHICKEN RUN instead . * 1/2 out of * * * * I give it .
pos	With various Bogdanoviches and Gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew " They all laughed " is very much a family affair . If you add the fact that B.Gazzara and Miss A.Hepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an ancillary consideration . If this all smacks of smug " in - joke " self gratification you will be pleased to hear that Mr Bogdanovich sails well clear of that particular hazard and delivers a sweet and rather innocent " I love N.Y. " paean that is also an altar at which we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late Miss Hepburn . Make no mistake this is her picture . Mr Gazzara concedes it to her most self - effacingly in all their scenes together . The plot - a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients ' affairs - is of minimal importance , it is the performance of the two leads that dominates the movie . Mr Bogdanovich 's triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actors , from " Targets " onwards . There is a glow about every one of his films that only special artists can coax from an inanimate piece of optical equipment . Miss Hepburn in particular benefits from this love . Extra insights into his work can be obtained from reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directors , principally " Who the hell 's in it ? " , recently remaindered in UK bookstores . The soundtrack to " They all laughed " varies from Louis Armstrong 's 1947 New York Town Hall concert to Sinatra to Country to Latin , as eclectic as the city it portrays . Mr B , s " Golden Boy " image was sure to tarnish , for such is the nature of the movie business , but it is equally sure one day to be restored , and when that day comes " They all laughed " will be recognised for the fine work that it is .
neg	SciFi has been having some extremely bad luck making quality movies lately ( such as Minotaur or Dog Soldiers ) . Grendel is supposed to be based of the great epic Beowulf , however , it deviates so much ( and offers so little in comparison ) that the advertisements on television might as well have titled it ' some shitty Christopher Lambert movie ' . I was n't expecting it to be as accurate as a full blown Hollywood production , but I did however expect the ' artistic integrity ' to not interfere with the actual story ( even if a little bit was changed to make a two hour storyboard flow nicely in the allotted time slots ) . Did the director and producers have any idea about what they were doing ( did any research go into this ? ) . Obviously not , as one could tell from the massive horned helmets that Beowulf and his crew ( save for mullet boy ) are wearing . One major problem I have though was with the very look of Grendel  if Beowulf is supposed to wrestle him , should n't he not have been sixteen feet tall and weigh 2 tons ? Grendel 's death segment was also lacking in every way  in my opinion the one in the epic was actually better than the made up junk on the script ; for example : Grendel is supposed to have his arm ripped out from the socket by Beowulf  not cut off at the forearm after he was set on fire by an exploding arrow from a crossbow that looks like it weighs 300lbs ! And Grendel 's mother  did they just combine her with the dragon at the end of the epic where he eventually dies when he succumbs to his wounds ? And honestly , what the hell was with that mullet ?   If you want to see this movie because its connection to the epic  .don't , as there really is n't one ( other than character names ) . The only way I could recommend this film is if you liked the movie Druids ( directed by Jacques Dorfmann )  although I do n't recommend watching either .
pos	but I want to say I can not agree more with Moira . What a wonderful film . I was thinking about it just this morning , wanting to give advice to some dopey sod who 'd lost money on his debit card through fraud , and wanted to say ' Keep thy money in thine pocket ' and realised I was talking like James Mason . Even tho he did n't say those words , I still think he would ! I 've never forgotten ' Are ye carrying ? ' in his reconciliation with his son , Hywel Bennet : ' Always have money in thine pocket ! ' Good advice . Not enough kids have fathers with such unforgiving but well - meant attitudes any more . Or any father at all . It would be a good thing for us to reinstate ' thee ' , ' thy ' and ' thine ' in our language to show we care . It is only the same as ' tutoyer ' in French or ' du ' in German . Addendum : I just realised that a lot of my remarks were about James Mason in The Family Way ! I think it 's because I mixed up Susan George with Hayley Mills . Well , easy mistake . I stand by the comments tho ' . And Spring and Port Wine is so very similar to The Family Way . When you took a girlfriend to the pictures in those days , you really had something to say and talk about afterwards , something that affected your knowledge of the world and your personal development . Theatrical experiences are almost real , and they are important in helping young people to grow up . It does n't happen now , I think , that teenagers can just go to the pics like we did .
neg	Worst De Niro Scorsese collaboration in this horrible agonizing violent overlong mess . Scorsese is totally out of his element in this film with the horror cliched suddenly loud phone ringing and door slamming gimmicks that seem laughable and embarrassing coming from such a master craftsman . The cast is totally wasted here and the southern accents are very annoying and forced . Nick Noltie plays the wimpiest lawyer in history who would ever believe he can defend anyone ! De Niro 's psychotic Bowden is nothing more than the typical 90 's movie psycho killer . The scene with De Niro and Lewis early on is very awkward and the climax goes on and on and we should all be more than tired of the on psycho stalker that never dies . One of my most horrible movie experiences . Rent the original it 's 100 times better .  
pos	This is one of the best movie I have ever seen . My parents comes from rural India and to some extend I have seen the life of the villagers . Peoples are really poor and have financial and social problems .   The movie just reflects exactly the same . Full credit to the director and the actor . They have done an excellent job . I just wonder how can movies like Lagaan and Paheli can go for Oscar and not Doghi . I do n't understand the criteria on which the movies are selected . Is the money that makes the difference or having some big names in the movie makes the difference . Hope to see more movies like this in the future .
neg	First of all , let 's get a few things straight here : a ) I AM an anime fan- always has been as a matter of fact ( I used to watch Speed Racer all the time in Preschool ) . b ) I DO like several B - Movies because they 're hilarious . c ) I like the Godzilla movies- a lot . Moving on , when the movie first comes on , it seems like it 's going to be your usual B - movie , down to the crappy FX , but all a sudden- BOOM ! the anime comes on ! This is when the movie goes WWWAAAAAYYYYY downhill . The animation is VERY bad & cheap , even worse than what I remember from SPEED RACER , for crissakes ! In fact , it 's so cheap , one of the few scenes from the movie I " vividly " remember is when a bunch of kids run out of a school ... & it 's the same kids over & over again ! The FX are terrible , too ; the dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla . In addition , the transition to live action to animation is unorganized , the dialogue & voices(especially the English dub that I viewed ) was horrid & I was begging my dad to take the tape out of the DVD/ VHS player ; The only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes & comments like the robots & Joel / Mike on MST3 K ( you pick the season ) . Honestly , this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie & survive it at the same time . Heck , I 'm planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on Halloween for a B - Movie night . Because it 's stupid , pretty painful to watch & unintentionally hilarious at the same time , I 'm giving this movie a 3/10 , an improvement from the 0.5/10 I was originally going to give it . ( According to my grading scale : 3/10 means Pretty much both boring & bad . As fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it , then it will become as fun as counting to 15 . )
pos	In Canadian director Kari Skogland 's film adaptation of the Margaret Laurence novel The Stone Angel Ellen Burstyn is Hagar Shipley , a proud and cantankerous woman approaching her nineties who wishes to remain independent until the very end , stubbornly refusing to be placed in a nursing home by her well - meaning son Marvin . Filmed in Manitoba , Canada and set in the fictional town of Manawaka , The Stone Angel is a straightforward and conventional interpretation of the book that has been required reading in Canadian high school English classes for almost half a century . The title of the film comes from the stone statue erected on Hagar 's mother 's grave which serves as a metaphor for Hagar 's inability to express emotion during her tumultuous lifetime . Burstyn brings vulnerability and humor to the role but is a bit too likable to fully realize the ego - driven , self - defeating character who managed to alienate her wealthy father , her well - meaning but alcoholic husband , and both of her sons . As she nears the end of her days , she reflects that " pride was my wilderness and the demon that led me there was fear . I was alone , never anything else , and never free , for I carried my chains within me , and they spread out from me and shackled all I touched " . Confronting having to spend her last days in a nursing home , Hagar looks back at her life and looks at her failed relationships , her recollections shown in flashbacks without voice - over narration . The story begins with a dance that she attended as a young girl . Chaperoned by her Aunt Dolly , she meets her future husband , the previously married Bram Shipley ( Cole / Wings Hauser ) , a poor farmer whose reputation in the town is sullied because of his association with the Native American population . The young Hagar is played by Christine Horne who is exceptional in her first feature role . Despite Hagar 's pleading , her relationship with Bram is rejected by her cold and rigid father whose refusal to attend the wedding starts the marriage off on the wrong foot . This is exacerbated by his leaving all of his money to the town of Manawaka , condemning the young couple to a life of poverty . Going through the motions of her marriage to Bram , Hagar withdraws from social activities to prevent being rejected by the town 's upper classes . When she produces two sons , Marvin ( Dylan Baker ) and John ( Kevin Zegers ) , she is unable to give them the love that they need . " Every joy I might have held in my man or any child of mine or even the plain light of morning " , she reflects , " all were forced to a standstill by some break of proper appearances  When did I ever speak the heart 's truth ? " Like the biblical Hagar who fled to the desert because she could not tolerate further affronts to her pride , Hagar leaves Manawaka to live in Ontario but eventually returns to the Shipley farm . As the scene shifts back to the present , Hagar runs away to an abandoned house near the ocean that she remembers from her childhood to escape from being placed in a nursing home by Marvin and his wife Doris ( Sheila McCarthy ) , Here she meets a young man named Leo ( Luke Kirby ) who takes an interest in her and compels her to look at and take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life . The Stone Angel pulls out all the emotional stops but never fully develops its characters to the point where I felt any stake in the story 's outcome , although the spirited performance by Ellen Page as John 's devoted but naive girlfriend and the moving final scenes bring a new energy to the film 's second half .
neg	Oh my God what the hell happened here ? ! ! I 'm not going to say this again but what sort of backward movie is this ? The dubbing in this is way worst than the dubbing in " King Kong vs Godzilla",Linda Miller had to be the worst actress in it and the suits are really cheesy . Its about some villain called Dr . Who who gets henchmen to build a robot gorilla that has the same strength as King Kong but when this robot breaks down he builds another one and then tries to kidnap Kong . When he does(thats when Linda Miller gets annoying)he makes Kong his slave but everything goes wrong and King Kong escapes . Then Dr . Who sends the robot after him . Later when I was watching the movie I got a headache when Linda Miller and the other clowns started moaning . As I sat through the misery of watching the DVD while it was playing I was hoping that the madness in the movie was going to end until the fight . The ending has to be a really bad one because they could 've shown Kong back on his island fighting dinosaurs again . Do n't watch the movie under any circumstances or if you do ... beware of the disappointment you will receive .
pos	This is a great film Classic from the 40 's and well produced . There are very dramatic scenes in this film with John Garfield,(Al Schmid),"Force of Evil",'48 and Dane Clark,(Lee Diamond),"Last Rites",'88 , fighting the Japs during WWII being completely surrounded and with only one machine - gun . When Al Schmid was able to go home after being wounded with a horrible injury , his problems just started to begin with his family and engaged girl friend . Dane Clark gave an outstanding supporting role as Lee Diamond , who did everything to help his buddy Al get his life together again . There is never a complete victory to War and lets not forget all the Brave Wounded Military personnel in Veterans Hospitals from All the Wars and our present Iraq Vets !
neg	At the time of writing this review it would seem that over 50 % of IMDb voters had given this film a rating of either a 10 or a 1 . I can only surmise then that those giving it a 10 were either cast or crew members .   They say that given enough monkeys and enough time and enough typewriters , those monkeys , just by random proddings at the keyboard , would eventually type out the complete works of Shakespeare . However , I seriously doubt that given the same number of monkeys and time , you could find a single one to give this movie a rating of 10 . I patiently watched the first half , foolishly assuming that the film would , on some level , develop either the plot or the characters , or maybe make some kind of social comment or provoke barely intellectual thought . Failing that , I was quite prepared to accept action , suspense , comedy , horror or even gratuitous sex as a way of holding my attention . Ultimately , I was disappointed and consequently , much of the second half was viewed at double speed as I searched in vain for some small snippet of cinematic redemption . Sadly , there was none . If " The Choke " , was put up against an episode of Scooby Doo then I 'm afraid the cartoon would win hands down in terms of mystery , intrigue and unpredictability . And speaking of cartoon characters , the acting abilities of the various cast members varied between acceptable ( at best ) and embarrassingly poor with Brooke Bailey 's portrayal of the freaky , death obsessed pseudo goth , London , being so bad I almost felt sorry for her . I would have liked to have finished on a positive note but even the soundtrack , a second rate feast of contemporary punk rock , failed even to entertain , let alone serve to enhance a very poor flick .
pos	this is n't ' Bonnie and Clyde ' or ' Thelma and Louise ' but it is a fine road movie . it sets up its two main characters gently and easily . viewers learn the underlying tensions quickly , which is a tribute to the director . there is the young french ( and English ) speaking son who wants to do well in France , has a french girlfriend and who drinks alcohol , parties as young men do . And there is his moroccan arabic ( and french ) speaking father who devoutly follows his Muslim faith , with generosity and the wisdom of elders and who rejects the new culture surrounding him ( like mobile phones ) . the film could explore very powerful politics - the odd couple drive thru the former Yugoslavia , thru Turkey and then thru the Middle East to get to Mecca . these are areas where the Muslim populations have been involved in wars , repression , ethnic cleansing ; where dictators have pursued torture and summary executions to hold power and where religious communities are in constant deadly battle with each other . yet the film moves thru those places and possibilities with only hints of such agendas . the relationship between the two is key to this film , and faith , politics are the backdrop . it seems to be saying that we are all human , and need to understand and care for each other in order to manage well in this world . it certainly is n't ' Natural Born Killers ' and is all the better for it .
neg	* * * May contain spoilers . * * *   If LIVING ON TOKYO TIME were some bold experiment where real - life wanna - be actors were given film parts on the condition that they would be required to take a combination of powerful prescription anti - anxiety , anti - depression , and anti - psychotic medications ( this is the classic psych ward combo that renders patients into drooling zombies ) all during filming , then this movie would hold far more interest . Or , if the film production was another type of experiment where all of the actors were sleep deprived before and during filming , then TOKYO TIME could be more easily explained . As it is , this film is filled with lifeless , low - energy actors . In the scene where the new husband was sitting on the stairs talking with his sister , it appeared that he was having trouble keeping his eyes open . In almost every scene he speaks his lines sitting down with every part of his body motionless . From beginning to end , his facial expression is best described as " near sleep . " Fret not about the actors speaking over each other 's lines because these actors can barely finish droning out any lines of dialog . Everyone speaks with a depressing , monotone voice . No laughing . No yelling . No vigor . No one has energy enough to crack a smile . The result : complete and total boredom . And it does not help matters that the direction is simple and amateurish . Avoid this lifeless film at all costs . Better to watch GREENCARD which has a similar plot and has charm and energy . Or , for an unconventional Japanese romance story , check out THE LONG VACATION which has an ample amount of everything LIVING ON TOKYO TIME does not .
pos	De Grot is a very good film . The great plot comes from the novel by Tim Krabbé , who also adapted this story for the screen . Some really top - class acting , not only by Van Huêt , but especially by Marcel Hensema , who mostly did TV - work prior to his performance of Axel van de Graaf . The film seems to kick of as a thriller , and sets an excellent mood . Then we start to learn about Egon Wagter and Axel van de Graaf , and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flash - back structure , which adds to the more romantic aspect and the character - driven drama of the movie . In the end this all culminates into an emotional ending , that will grab audiences by their throats . Make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie . A must - see , especially if you liked ' Spoorloos ' ( The Vanishing 's original screen adaptation ) .
neg	It is pretty surreal what these flies can do ... eh well ... this is a cartoon , so anything can happen in it . At first I must tell you that I love animated movies . Unfortunately this year 's repertoire is very weak . This cartoon is nothing but a list of flaws : 1 ) I quoted the tag line . It suggests that this movie has great 3D effects . Well , I did not see any , at least not something special I never saw before . 2 ) The " flies " in this movie look nothing like real flies . At least they could 've make them black . But cyan flies , seriously ? With giant heads and slim torsos ? 3 ) The story . I guess it was written for 6 year old kids . I could tell it in two sentences it is so over simplified . 4 ) Excessive patriotism . For example : " They are American files after all ! " Oh , give me a break .
pos	A very interesting entertainment , with the charm of the old movies . Tarzan faces the greatest perils without hesitation if the moment requires it , and we all enjoy with him his success . The most insteresting for me is a man without special powers facing the problems and beating them just with human skills ( he was a great swimmer and had a great shout )
neg	Want to know the secret to making a slasher film set at a fitness center work ? Just pad the film out with lovely ladies in super tight workout outfits and have them bump and grind the floor like they are at a gentleman 's club . That 's what the makers of this horrid slasher film did and that little gimmick kept me watching till the bitter end . This is the worst slasher film I have ever seen , but every time I was ready to switch the channel , they 'd add another scene with the workout girls and I 'd stay put . As a slasher film , Killer Workout fails in every category I can think of . As a showcase for beautiful girls working out , it is a success . Strong recommendation to avoid , unless the thought of half the film being a big T&A show appeals to you .
pos	This is an excellent movie with a stellar cast and some great acting . I never tire of watching it . I especially love the scene where Danny Glover 's character and Kevin Kline 's character namely Simon and Mack have brunch together . Kevin Kline is such a natural and it seems his mannerisms are effortless and one you would encounter often . SO its a very ' real ' movie .   One of the most powerful scenes in the movie however , is at the beginning of the movie when Simon arrives at the scene where Mack 's car has broken down . The movie also has a strong message and is unlike the stereotypical message carrying movie where there 's one person preaching his guts out to an audience . Instead the actors ' emotions and situations deliver an impactive message that does best without the use of words . And lastly , Mary McDonell is brilliant as always .
neg	By far the most important requirement for any film following confidence tricksters is that they must , at least occasionally , be able to pull one over on us , as well as their dumb - witted marks , the cops , the mob and ( ideally ) each other . But this film NEVER pulls this off . Every scam can be seen coming a mile off ( especially the biggen ! ) Neither are they very interesting , intricate or sophisticated . Perhaps Mammet hoped to compensate for this with snappy dialogue and complex psychological relationships . If so , he failed . The lines are alright , but they 're delivered in such a stilted , unnatural , stylised way that I thought perhaps some clever point was being made about us all acting all the time ... but it was n't . As for the psychological complexity , the main character 's a bit repressed and makes some ridiculously forced freudian slips about her father thinking she 's a whore , but she gets over it . I really liked the street scenes though . Looked just like an Edward Hopper painting .
pos	Classic drama / action western with incredible cinematography that is well ahead of it 's time(1954 ) . The production is very good and you can tell that it was done with pride and love . Unique peek into the American NORTHT WEST pioneers is very educational and entertaining . This movie is very under rated because most people do not like to see the reality that many " lawmen " during this particular time and place were very crooked / corrupt much like most developing countries today . The action sequences could have been more realistic though but still , this movie really covers most of the essentials . Not for an audience who wants only pure testoterone type westerns for this movie is more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy .......
neg	Despite pretty bad reviews , I just had to give this film a go  it does , after all , star HK super - babe Shu Qi plus 6 other oriental lovelies as a team of all - action cat - burglars . Surely that 's worth checking out ? Well , as babe - fests go , Martial Angels is hard to beat . The eye candy is top quality . Shu Qi looks as fantastic as always , and of the rest of the girls , Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang caught my roving eye in particular . Unfortunately , if one is to judge this movie by any other possible merits , it is an absolute stinker ! The story is weak , the action shoddy and the special effects downright pathetic . Director Clarence Fok and Producer Wong Jing have given us a photogenic cast and little else . If Shu Qi is the only reason you 're contemplating seeing this one , you would be better off watching Sex and Zen 2 again !
pos	When I first saw this movie I was with my dad . He encouraged me to watch this movie because it was one of his favorites . After watching the movie it instantly became one of my favorites .   A River Runs Through It is about two brothers who each take a different path in life . Norman Maclean ( Craig Sheffer ) is the older of the two brothers and he is set on the path of education . Paul Maclean ( Brad Pitt ) is the rebellious younger brother who travels on a path full of obstacles . The movie follows these characters as the each follow their own path . There is no downside to this movie . You will be entertained the whole way through . The acting , directing , and script is all perfect . The two things that are exceptional are the cinematography and the score . Both of which entrap you in the world Robert Redford creates for you .   This is an all around great movie that is destined to be a classic . It sure is in my book . If you have n't seen this movie definitely watch it as soon as you can because it will stay with you forever .
neg	This was longer than the Ten Commandments , All Lord of the Rings and the Matrix Trilogy combined . My oh My , what a nightmare . This is the single biggest over - hype of 2006 . THere is not a moment that is not scripted and clichéd . Movie Musicals can be done brilliantly and bring genuine excitement to the viewer . Dreamgirls takes the route of Chinese Water Torture , in the form of endless music montages , shoddy acting , and poor directing choices ( Seriously , Mr. Condon , did you HAVE to do the old Billboard countdown shots ? It 's at # 58 ! No wait , look its rising up the charts and here is the passing Billboard notice to show you again .... and again .... and again )
pos	Bellocchio refers to this as a mainly political movie , a description of the revolutionary movement in Italy , but that seems more metaphor than reality . Well , almost everything in the movie seems like metaphor . The revolutionaries , of whom we see and about whom we learn very little , might as well be mafiosi . Out with the old and in with the new . Andrea 's Papa , a psychoanalyst , seems to stand for the usual traditional bourgeois values -- morally upright , unperturbed , clean and tidy , thoroughly ritualized . Giullia , the girlfriend of a revolutionary , seems to represent what can happen to someone who needs very badly a cause to support but is unable to muster up the kind of devotion such a commitment demands . ( I 'm guessing here . ) Andrea , the adolescent boy , seems to be the only guy in the movie who is not in some unquiet way " upatz . " He 's respectful of his father but disobedient too . He loves Giullia , or so we assume , although he 's not really old enough to have learned how to manage his reflexes optimally , but he leaves her in order to show up at school and complete his final exams . His course between these contradictory lifestyles could be described as " media . " He 's the man in between , who knows the meaning of gradualism , who can keep his cool while those about him are screaming . Most of this is summed up during the oral part of his finals when he is asked to translate and comment on an excerpt from " Antigone , " which contrasts the traditional authority of the gods with the notion of secularity and free will . That brings us -- by no particular course that I 'm aware of -- to Marushka Detmars . She brings to mind a New Yorker cartoon of a few years ago . Two hippos are neck - deep in the river , staring at a gazelle drinking from the bank , and one hippo says to the other , " I hate her . " She 's a good actress . ( Let me get that out of the way . ) But so is everyone else in the film . She carries with her , in her speech and manner , the rich glitter of outright lunacy . And it all comes from the actress too , not from directorial aid . Detmars is n't nuts the way Catherine DeNeuve was nuts in " Repulsion . " The walls do n't turn to rubber and grow hands . Instead , we see her animated -- sometimes TOO animated . And she gives us shocking jolts when her mood abruptly changes and becomes threatening the way a looming thunderstorm is threatening . A critic described her as sultry , but that 's probably not the word he was searching for . She 's compellingly beautiful with her fluffy brown hair , her wide white ready grin , her impulsive giggles . And her eyes are like the eyes in the paintings on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs . The sexy parts are pretty erotic , not so much because one of them is explicit , but because we 've gotten to know the characters involved . ( It 's more interesting to spy on the honeymoon couple next door than go to a skin flick . ) Actually there is n't THAT much sex . There is only one scene of simulated intercourse but the director lets it play out in what seems to be real time . At least real time for an eighteen - year - old boy . The young man who plays Andrea is fine too , which is a necessary thing , because the film depends almost entirely on him and Giullia . They have to carry it and they do . If it were not for their performances , I 'm not sure this would be as interesting or as admirable flick as it is . It could easily have been turned into a rather slow , boring romance . Worth it .
neg	The Marquis De Sade , Egypt , ancient Gnostic cults , Robert Englund in a dual role , gratuitous sex and nudity , murder and mayhem ... on paper Tobe Hopper 's Night Terrors sounds like it should be at least a fun , entertaining flick given the ingredients . It 's not . It is a plot less , incoherent shambles that brings little entertainment . There is basically no plot beyond some vague stuff about a cult that follows the work of De Sade who for some unclear reason feel the need to seduce the daughter of a local Christian archaeologist and kill her . That is pretty much it- I think it has something to with the Gnostics but who knows what the writers were thinking . Most of the movie is a meandering mess as the heroine is exposed to various weirdness , dream sequences and erotic encounters , intercut with scenes of Englund as the imprisoned De Sade in the 19th century chewing the scenery . It seems like the makers were trying for something serious but whatever their pretensions were they are buried in the cheesiness , bad acting , sleaze and fake looking decapitated heads . There are n't too many good points . Robert Englund is fun to watch , as always and the lead actress , Zoe Trilling , whilst not very talented , is attractive and in various stages of undress through the movie but watching Night Terrors is a chore . At least I got to see the movie from which the " When you 're as criminal as I " bit from the Australian film certification ratings guide that was on the front of so many VHS tapes from the nineties came from .
pos	Ettore Scola , one of the most refined and grand directors we worldly citizens have , is not yet available on DVD ... ( it 's summer 2001 right now .... ) Mysteries to goggle the mind .   This grand classic returned to the theaters in my home - town thanks to a Sophia Loren - summer - retrospective , and to see it again on the big screen after all these years of viewing it on a video - tape ... it is a true gift .   To avoid a critique but nonetheless try to prove a point : i took my reluctant younger brother with me to see this film . He never saw the film before and " does n't like those Italian Oldies ... " Like all the others in the theater he was intrigued by this wonder . Even during the end - titles the theater remained completely silent .   This SPECIAL DAY is truly special . A wonder of refinement . And a big loss if you have n't seen it ( yet ) ...
neg	Contrary to its title , this film offers no spice and thus audience is subjected to a tasteless dish . All Humor appears forced , theatrical , mechanical , staged , reminiscent of those Pakistani plays available on video , including even the mannerisms . Everybody is screaming , shouting and doing odd things for no reason . The premise looks interesting as it is a straight lift from Hollywood 's ' Boeing Boeing " . John Abraham who is so natural in almost all his films is a complete misfit here . If we keep morality factor aside , even then the bizarre events looks trite . Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal , two experienced stalwarts try hard to lift the film by being natural but in vain . At least , the characters of three girls should be made contrasting in order to bring some interesting elements but sadly here too all of them appears those brainless , buxomed bimbettes ( 3Bs ) who talk , behave and even scream in quite similar fashion . The major hole in the plot is what made the protagonist keep the three girls at his same home pretending that they will never get to know about each other ? Just to do some Sex , what else ? The same could be done in hundreds of other ways . Therefore so much dramabaazi for no reason is not something audience will digest easily . But surely , great flesh show and tempting promos always gives such films a great initial . Now for those who call it a situational comedy , I call it a pathetic taste . Sense of humor of such cinema going audience is surely gone corrupted and demented to the extent that they are connecting to a sadistic , weird and maddening type of humor , where it is not the characters that they laugh at but rather at themselves and at their own frustrations that look how senseless we have become that in order to laugh we have to bear with such things ?
pos	Teenager Eddie spends his life being bullied and humiliated due to his obsession with heavy metal music . One day he finds out his hero Sammi Curr has died , supposedly burned by the establishment which wanted to put a stop to his music . But Eddie has his last record , never released , and when he plays it he starts receiving messages telling him how to deal with his tormentors . Before long Sammi has revealed he intends to return to life at the local Halloween party to exact revenge on the town which once mocked him . Filled with humour and in - jokes , this is a highly entertaining film . Sammi himself is an original horror movie villain , plays on the ' evils of rock music ' obsessions of the 80 's . Well worth watching .
neg	Wow . This is really not that good .   I would like to agree with the others in that at least the acting is good ... it is , but it is nothing special . The movie is so precictable and i for one am sick of receiving culture info through movies . * / * * * *
pos	This movie is not great , but it is a good and enjoyable one . It feels like an indie film made out of a play script . Morgan Freeman basically plays himself , although the director swears the script was not written for him . And there is the small irony of the actor that goes in a supermarket to do research for a film that he has n't committed to yet . I mean , he actually made the film in the end and we are watching it :) I found the dialogue a bit too positive for my taste , but refreshing nonetheless . This is a film that inspires the viewer to take a look at their own lives and choose the direction in which to go . A bit too much emphasis on appearance , if you ask me . Bottom line : a nice little film , made in two weeks , with basically two actors and a few extras , dialogue driven , makes Morgan Freeman look good :)
neg	A craven , cowardly film . Director Boorman shows Cahill burglarizing rich houses , but the male occupant is shown being unfaithful with the nanny , that s all right then . The forensic scientist investigating Cahill is blown up in his car , but he is rat faced sourpuss , and does n't look like a nice man , so that s all right too . The Beits , owner of Russborrough House , made their money by exploiting ' darkies ' digging up diamonds , so it 's okay to rob priceless art from them and hide it in a bunker in the Wicklow mountains . The Garda kill his ferrets and are implicated in his murder . The moral equivalencing is sickening , Boorman looks for a hit film , but does n't have the guts to stand against the criminality of the generals gang , who terrorized the neighbourhood , and unleashed another wave of scumbags upon Dublin . He even liaised with the Generals son while making it . Disgusting . Shame on him for his cowardice .
pos	I was deeply moved by this movie in many respects . First of all , I just want to say that Clara Lago was the most precious little thing ! Such a pretty little girl . Her acting was superb as well . True to life and very human . Though I do n't like the part where she had to smoke ; I hope it was only a fake prop . Either way , she was absolutely wonderful and the story was so moving . I found myself immersed in the story and her character . It 's quite interesting how I came to discover this movie actually . I was walking in blockbuster and I just happened to notice her pretty smile on the cover as I was walking by . Luckily I glanced in the downward direction that this movie was in ! I thought to myself , ' Awe , look at her ! ' So I picked it up and saw that this movie was described as such wonderful things as " A Little Gem . " I read the plot on the back and then thought that , well , maybe I 'd look it up on IMDb first and then come back and rent it at a later time . I 'm glad I did n't , because I certainly would have been missing out . After searching for a movie with my friend , I knew that I would end up regretting not renting this film , so I went back to the spot in which I originally found it and snapped it up . It had been on my dresser for a week , since school started for me this week and I really had n't any time to watch it , but tonight was the perfect opportunity . I popped it in and was glued to the beautiful cinematography , delightful score and moving plot from beginning to end . I was so captivated and must say , some parts nearly moved me to tears . I would also like to make a special mention for the young boy in this film , Juan Jose Ballesta . He was remarkable . Also the actor who played Carol 's father , who 's name is unfortunately not listed on the site . His voice was just so loving and gentle that I could really sense his love for Carol . Even though his appearance is not prominent , I really felt his character 's presence . This is truly a wonderful movie . If you are a person who is moved by light , but emotional films , then this is definitely one for you .
neg	Violence whether real or not always has an impact . In this film the violence is about as crass as you could ask for . In the Great Ecstacy the director has successfully demonstrated what extremes of violence people are capable of . But what was the point ? The violence looks like a mix of Noë 's ' Irreversible , and ' Kubrick 's ' Clockwork Orange' ... both of which are remarkable films . Do n't get me wrong , I 'm not opposed to screen violence at all and I 've seen some nasty stuff in my film - going years , but this film as a whole is totally juvenile . The story is never developed enough to offer any reason for the extreme violence , the rizla paper thin reason we are give for Robert 's demise is his introduction to drugs . Danny Dyer plays the character who is partly responsible for Robert 's drug fuelled demise , however he is on screen for less than 5 minutes . Lesley Manville is Robert 's unable to cope mum , I am not sure what either of these actors is doing in a film of this low caliber . The acting is wooden , the scene in the kitchen with the TV - cook and his wife for instance is as painful to watch if not more so than the shocking finale- who wrote those dialogues ? ! Some of the comments the boys make ... 'looks like she 's enjoying it ' are so trite as to tempt one to laugh if it were not for Clay 's ardent desire to bombard us with harrowing images of mutilated female genitals . Why we need to be shown such detail possibly down to the director 's adolescent obsession with sadistic pornographic imagery ... one can only wonder at this young man 's psychology . The ' political meaning ' of the film was repeatedly brought to our attention due to the amount of scenes ; in the bar , outside the TV - cook 's house , war in Iraq reports , was perhaps too obvious in my opinion . Yes , war is violent , social determinism causes frustration , we 're all prone to horrifingly violent acts whether you 're in politics or on the street popping E. Juxtaposing all these things as part of the same underlying issue is evading the actual issue which is the meaning of violence in man . This issue is one that we still have n't managed to grasp and certainly not in this film . My opinion : derivative , badly - made and pointless .
pos	Anyone who loves the Rheostatics ' music is going to enjoy this film . I have some minor complaints , mainly about pacing and the casting of certain actors ( not Maury ) who are n't really convincing in their roles , but I do n't have time write a detailed review . I just want to warn anyone who has seen this film or plans to watch this film as presented CBC television in Canada : The version that airs are the CBC is like the Reader 's Digest version of WHALE MUSIC --- don't watch it . It cuts out entire scenes and subplots ( if you can them that ) from the film . The CBC , which presents most of films untouched , took half the guts out of WHALE MUSIC . I do n't know why . It 's horrible what they did to the film . Rent the video or watch it in a theatre , but DON'T watch it on CBC television .
neg	Malcolm McDowell has not had too many good movies lately and this is no different . Especially designed for people who like Yellow filters on their movies .
pos	This is the second movie based on the life and times of ultra hung porn star , John Curtis Estes , better known as John Holmes . Boogie Nights is also roughly based on his life . Maybe someday someone is going to do a movie on the life of Tommy Byron instead . The problem is , that the story is not very well told . There are many Law & Order episodes that have more twists and turns than Wonderland , and the director never gets the criminal case going with any kind of gusto . Val Kilmer has two problems - he is not nearly as hung as Holmes is ( and no prosthesis this time around , unlike in Boogie Nights ) , and he is much better looking than mope Holmes .   The director does not introduce one single likable individual among the cast . The racist , immature lowlifes he hangs out with , or his wife , and the police do n't get much in the way of characterization .   The best part of the movie is Eric Bogosian telling Paris Hilton to " get lost " .   Having said all that , anyone interested in the sleaziest side of the porn business in the 1980s or true crime should n't miss it .
neg	In the unlikely case that some aspiring directors are reading these comments , I 'd like to offer some advice ( free of charge ! ) , from a viewer 's perspective . If you want to make a serious exotic adventure film , do it . If you want to make a spoof of exotic adventure films , go ahead . DO NOT try to make both at the same time , it does n't work . For example , having a goofy " comic relief " character killed and beheaded and following it up with a monkey shaking a tree and dropping a coconut on a cannibal 's head just makes you look like you had NO IDEA what kind of movie you wanted to make . This one is boring , meandering , cheap , racist .... you get the picture . A couple of smart moments and a few glimpses of nudity from Kathy Shower ( way too prissy here ) are hardly worth your trouble . There is a reason everyone has forgotten about this film 's existence . ( * 1/2 )
pos	Telemundo should definitely consider making a DVD collection of the novela Xica ! I know tons of people including myself who would like to be able to purchase the novela Xica ! It is a very entertaining novela which is set in Brazil . The costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the town in which the novela takes place is beautiful . Xica contains a lot of history of that time period . I wish Telemundo would televise it again even if it was a 2 in the morning . I would highly recommend watching Xica if it is ever shown again on Telemundo . I 've e - mailed Telemundo a million times already to show the novela again but my pleas have fallen on deaf ears . The only cautionary statement about Xica is that it occasionally contains some harsh scenes therefore I would recommend that children under 14 do not watch Xica . Overall Xica merits a 10 out of 10 !
neg	Joe Don 's opening line says everything about this movie . It takes place on the island of Malta ( the island of pathetic men ) and involves Joe Don Baker tracking down an Italian mobster . Joe Don 's character is named Geronimo ( pronounced Heronimo ) and all he does in this movie is shoot people and get arrested over and over agin . Everyone in the movie hates him , just like everyone hates Greydon Clark . I liked an earlier Greydon picture , " Angel 's Revenge " because it was a shirne for thriteen year old boys . Avoid this movie at all costs ! !
pos	Ghost Story,(The New House ) is a terrific horror story . This is from the Circle Of Fear and the Ghost Story series of the early seventies . The beginning and ending of each story is narrated by Sebastian Cabot . Remember him from the early family series , Family Affair in the 1960s ? This particular story has Barbara Parkins and David Birney as the lead actors , and as the main characters in the story . I saw this recently , and I was so scared!If you are alone , I would not recommend that you watch this . This story is terrific , no gore or curse words , but very scary . Barbara Parkins played the young bride . David Birney played her husband . Both actors were very good in their parts . If you like scary , fun , terrifying ghost stories , then you will like this little gem . I gave this a high rating . I highly recommend this story .
neg	I was sooooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week . My 13 year old son was looking forward to it too . I rented it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screen . Boy , was I disappointed . This movie veered off from the book more times than is forgivable . George C. Scott is an excellent actor but in this , it seemed that he was fully into character only about 20 % of the time . The rest of the time he was quite flat . I realize that this was made in ' 84 , pre - CG effects , for the most part . But it looked to be very B - movie quality , especially the encounter with Jacob Marley . The biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story : When the Spirit of Christmas Present takes Scrooge on the whirlwind tour of the world , observing people in the bleakest of circumstances still having the light and love of Christmastime . I will admit that Mr. Scott did a good job with the " reformed " Scrooge at the end . That was a refreshing portrayal . I wish that Bob Cratchit had been portrayed as a little more ragged and down - trodden . And Tiny Tim ... oh do n't even get me started on bad child actors ...
pos	Just after the end of WWII Powell & Pressburger were asked to come up with something to try to heal the rift developing between the UK & the USA . At the time there was a lot of " Overpaid , over sexed and over here " type of comments . Somehow they came up with this masterpiece . My favourite movie of ALL time . It 's got everything . Romance , poetry , emotion , religion , drama and very quirky . I can never explain exactly why , but it hits all the right buttons and although I 've seen it hundreds of times ( yes , really ) I 'm still guaranteed to be in tears at many points throughout . Was it the magnificent acting , the wonderful sets , the inspired script ? Who knows . But * DO * watch it and you 'll see what I mean .
neg	This movie is a waste of film stock . Do you believe that the map of a plan of a military mission would be placed on an easel on a patio in broad daylight for anyone with binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens to see ? It happened in this film . Do you believe that a DEAF person would actually be enlisted in the active duty army in Europe during WWII to serve in a " Negro " unit ... cooking , supply services , burial detail , etc . ? It happened in this film . Do you believe that a black ( and supposedly intelligent ) officer would select this same DEAF K.P. to be part of an active combat mission to protect a dam from being destroyed by the Germans before the allies arrived ? It happened in this film . Would you be surprised that the DEAF soldier did n't realize that a German plane was approaching from behind and would strafe and kill him ? It happened in this film . Would you be surprised that a group of American soldiers hold - up in a barn at a farmhouse that the Germans happened upon would SHOUT out their emotions at the sight of the German soldiers who were just 50 ' away ? They did it in this film , and left any possible entrances to the barn the Germans might check totally unprotected . Would you believe that , over the airwaves and in clear English , the Captain mentioned the General 's rank , if not his name , as the person he was speaking with and that the general , in plain English over open airwaves , said that the dam had to be protected the next day ? Maybe they should have just sent in an emissary to tell which direction the American attack would be coming from just to make it a little easier on the Germans . This so - called movie should be placed on a list of the top 50 worst films . If it were , I 'm sure it would do well . Watch it at your own risk .
pos	The snobs and pseudo experts consider it " a far cry from De Sica 's best " The ones suffering from a serious lack of innocence will find a problem connecting to this masterpiece . De Sica spoke in a very direct way . His Italianness does n't have the convoluted self examination of modern Italian filmmakers , or the bitter self parody of Pietro Germi , the pungent bittersweetness of Mario Monicelli , the solemnity of Visconti or the cold observation of Antonioni . De Sica told us the stories like a father sitting at the edge of his children 's bed before they went to sleep . There is no attempt to intellectualize . Miracolo A Milano and in a lesser degree Il Giudizio Universale are realistic fairy tales , or what today we call magic realism . The film is a gem from beginning to end and Toto is the sort of character that you accept with an open heart but that , naturally , requires for you to have a heart . Cinema in its purest form . Magnificent .
neg	This film concerns the story of Eddy as mentioned in the title and his homecoming to old friends in a seaside community . The plot involves the group of friends as it comes to light that Eddy left as a means to deal with death of a friend in which he feels in some way responsible . But this is inconsequential , as the choices made in the production are extremely poor and not fully realized . Screenplays not always need be ' chatty ' , but they should at least assist the development of the story . Here one line attempts such as " he just took off " or " I know you do n't have love in heart " just do fully evoke something worth the audience 's time . Also whenever the writer feels at a loss to where to go to next he cuts to a music montage of the protagonist walking through fields to some indie mood music . Talk about trying to hard . If you are interested in a good film , the type that gives quality and substance over just style then this is not the film for you .
pos	Like Ishtar and King of Comedy , other great , misunderstood comedies , Envy has great performances by two actors playing essentially , losers ( may be too harsh a word , I will call them suburban under - achievers ) . This film was a dark comedy gem , and I 'm not sure what people expect . I relish seeing a major studio comedy that is n't filled with obvious humor , and I believe that the small moments in this movie make it worthwhile . The look on Stiller 's face when he sees the dog doo disappear for the first time captures a moment , a moment that most people should be able to recognize in themselves . Yes , it was a fairly simple story , but it examined the root of envy in a really interesting way . There were a lot of great scenes ( the J - Man 's decrepit " cabin by the lake " , Corky 's unceremonious burial , Weitz 's wife role , and Walken 's J - Man -- all great stuff . I ca n't stand people that get on IMDb and mercilessly trash films when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to make one . I will take Envy over almost any of the top ten grossing comedies of the year ( save Napoleon Dynamite . ) It 's wittier , wackier , and an offbeat , enjoyable gem . Remember this people ; Most times , Popular does n't equal Good .
neg	Horrible , Horrible , Horrible do not waste your money to rent this movie . Its like a low budget made for TV Canadian movie . Absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen and there have been many others out there . This movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in the DVD player or VCR . : ~ ( . Is it possible to write ten lines ? The acting was horrific . It had absolutely no flow . I saw the made for TV movie on the BTK killer and it was much better(in comparison to this one ) . I am not sure what they were going for in producing this film but if it was to educate us or tell a story about the BTK killer they missed by a mile . It appeared to be more of a infomercial for animal rights .
pos	While there are n't any talking animals , big lavish song production numbers , or villians with half white / half black hair ... it does have 1 thing ... realistic people acting normally in a strange circumstance , and Walt & Roy did in their eras with the studio . If you thought think " The Castaways " or " The Island At The Top Of The World " were n't identical , or you hold them to a higher authority than Atlantis , then your idealism is just as whacked as keeping your kids up till midnight to watch a friggin ' cartoon .
neg	Profanity , stupidity , self - indulgence , and bad acting all join forces for a true tour de force in terrible movie - making . Pesci 's attempt to prove My Cousin Vinny was no fluke , shows the opposite instead . He is generally too lightweight and foulmouthed to handle the lead . A true must - miss !
pos	This is an awesome Amicus horror anthology , with 3 great stories , and fantastic performances ! , only the last story disappoints . All the characters are awesome , and the film is quite chilling and suspenseful , plus Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are simply amazing in this!. It 's very underrated and my favorite story has to be the 3rd one " Sweets To The Sweet " , plus all the characters are very likable . Some of it 's predictable , and the last story was incredibly disappointing and rather bland ! , however the ending was really cool!. This is an awesome Amicus horror anthology , with 3 great stories , and fantastic performances , only the last story disappoints ! , i say it 's must see!. 1st Story ( " Method for Murder " ) . This is an awesome story , with plenty of suspense , and the killer Dominic is really creepy , and it 's very well acted as well!. This was the perfect way to start off with a story , and for the most part it 's unpredictable , plus the double twist ending is shocking , and quite creepy!. Grade A 2nd Story . ( " Waxworks " ) . This is a solid story all around , with wonderful performances , however the ending is quite predictable , but it 's still creepy , and has quite a bit of suspense , Peter Cushing did an amazing job , and i could n't believe how young Joss Ackland was , i really enjoyed this story!. Grade B 3rd Story ( " Sweets to the Sweet " ) . This is the Best story here , as it 's extremely creepy , and unpredictable throughout , it also has a nice twist as well!. Christopher Lee did an amazing job , and Chloe Franks did a wonderful job as the young daughter , plus the ending is quite shocking!. I do n't want to spoil it for you , but it 's one of the best horror stories i have seen!. Grade A+ 4th Story ( " The Cloak " ) . This is a terrible story that 's really weak and unfunny Jon Pertwee annoyed me , however the ending surprised me a little bit , and Ingrid Pitt was great as always , however it 's just dull , and has been done before many times , plus where was the creativity ? ? . Grade D The Direction is great!. Peter Duffell does a great job here , with awesome camera work , great angles , adding some creepy atmosphere , and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. The Acting is awesome!. John Bryans is great here , as the narrator , he had some great lines , i just wished he had more screen time . John Bennett is very good as the Det . , and was quite intense , he was especially good at the end ! , i liked him lots . Denholm Elliott is excellent as Charles , he was vulnerable , showed fear , was very likable , and i loved his facial expressions , he rocked!. Joanna Dunham is stunningly gorgeous ! , and did great with what she had to do as the wife , she also had great chemistry with Denholm Elliott ! . Tom Adams is incredibly creepy as Dominic , he was creepy looking , and got the job done extremely well!. Peter Cushing is amazing as always , and is amazing here , he is likable , focused , charming , and as always , had a ton of class ! ( Cushing Rules ! ! ) . Joss Ackland is fantastic as always , and looked so young here , i barely recognized him , his accent was n't so thick , and played a different role i loved it ! ( Ackland rules ) . Wolfe Morris is creepy here , and did what he had to do well . Christopher Lee is amazing as always and is amazing here , he is incredibly intense , very focused , and as always had that great intense look on his face , he was especially amazing at the end ! ( Lee Rules ! ! ) . Chloe Franks is adorable as the daughter , she is somewhat creepy , and gave one of the best child performances i have ever seen ! , i loved her . Nyree Dawn Porter is beautiful and was excellent as the babysitter , i liked her lots!. Jon Pertwee annoyed me here , and was quite bland , and completely unfunny , he also had no chemistry with Ingrid Pitt!. Ingrid Pitt is beautiful , and does her usual Vampire thing and does it well!.   Rest of the cast do fine . Overall a must see!. * * * * out of 5
neg	It was interesting to see how accurate the writing was on the geek buzz words , yet very naive on the corporate world . The Justice Department would catch more of the big corp giants if they did such naive things to win . The real corporate world is much more subtle and interesting , yet every bit as sinister . I seriously doubt ANY corp would actually kill someone directly ; even the mod is more indirect these days . In the real world , they do kill people with nicotine , pollution , additives , poisons , etc . This movie must have been developed by some garage geeks , I think , and the studios did n't know the difference . They just wanted something to capitalize on the Microsoft antitrust case in the news .
pos	For a danish movie , I have to say , that this is very good movie . It 's in a class of its own , yet it has an international potential . The movie has a big budget , and is starring famous danish actors , and a few newcomers , who play very well . It can be watched by anyone who like adventures , and a little bit of ' ghost ' movie . Do n't be afraid , be thrilled !
neg	Another made for TV piece of junk ! This is an insult of a war movie ( I use the word movie in it 's loosest possible form ! ) I thought Telly Savalas 's career had hit rock bottom when he did the voice over on that visit Birmingham video that 's shown on Tarrant on TV on a semi regular basis , but then I 'd forgot he was involved in this ! I 'd tried to push it into my subconscious memory , but cable TV brought the memory kicking and screaming out of me ! !   I like the bit ( laughs sarcastically ! ) in the film which claims to be a scene from Liverpool in the forties , but it 's blatantly a shot of Zagreb Cathedral in the late eighties . Also the steam train the Commando 's are training on shows the JZ ( Jugoslavia Zeleznice , or Yugoslav state railways ) logo 's on the side of the locomotive quite clearly , even though the makers have tried to black them out . Why not just film in the UK , if that 's where most of the film is set ?   Cheap rubbish , and a waste of celluloid !
pos	John Thaw , of Inspector Morse fame , plays old Tom Oakley in this movie . Tom lives in a tiny English village during 1939 and the start of the Second World War . A bit of a recluse , Tom has not yet recovered from the death of his wife and son while he was serving during the First World War . If you can imagine Inspector Morse old and retired , twice as crochety as when he was a policeman , then you 've got Tom Oakley 's character . Yet this heart of flint is about to melt . London children are evacuated in advance of the blitz . Young William ( Willie ) Beech is billeted with the protesting Tom . Willie is played to good effect by Nick Robinson . This boy is in need of care with a capital C. Behind in school , still wetting the bed , and unable to read are the smallest of his problems . He comes from a horrific background in London , with a mother who can not cope , to put it mildly . Slowly , yet steadily , man and boy warm to each other . Tom discovers again his ability to love and care . And the boy learns to accept this love and caring . See Tom and Willie building a bomb shelter at the end of their garden . See Willie 's joy at what is probably his first ever birthday party thrown by Tom . Not to give away the ending , but Willie is adopted by Tom after much struggle , and the pair begin a new life much richer for their mutual love . In this movie , Thaw and Robinson are following in a long line of movies where man meets boy and develop a mutual love . See the late Dirk Bogarde and Jon Whiteley in " Spanish Gardener " . Or Clark Gable and Carlo Angeletti in " It Started in Naples " . Or Robert Ulrich and Kenny Vadas in " Captains Courageous " . Or Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl in " Man Without a Face " . Two points of interest . This is the only appearance of Thaw that I know of where he sings . Only a verse of a hymn , New Jerusalem , but he does sing . Second , young Robinson also starred in a second movie featuring " Tom " in the title , " Tom 's Midnight Garden " , which is based on a classic children 's novel .
neg	I love the music of the Clash and I love the music of Joe Strummer and The Mescaleros . I went to this movie hoping to learn about the man behind most of that . But I came out of the theatre not knowing much more about Joe than I already did after reading the entry on Wikipedia . The movie never really gets through to the person , his thoughts and feelings . What they did was to collect the little material that they had , shaky blurry videos and to interview some people about Joe Strummer at a camp fire . It turns out that most of these people knew him very little or not at all , and that the director just wanted them in the movie in order to have some more celebrities say , " Oh , he was such an inspiration to all of us " . Like Bono or Johnny Depp ( whom they seemingly asked to keep his pirate costume on to benefit from his current success in Pirates of the Caribbean ) . It seems that the director could not even wait until the body was cold before he jumped in to sell his version of " the greatest punk rocker and hippie at heart " that ever lived , sanctifying the person without really knowing enough about him . Sure , being a fan i enjoyed seeing the images of the band , hearing the anecdotes behind the songs and such , but in the end I felt like what remained as the portrait of Joe Strummer could have easily been told in 60 - 90 minutes . Go see the movie if you are a fan , otherwise better listen to some music of the Clash or even better the undeservedly unknown Mescaleros , where Joe Strummer reached the peak of his musical development before his death , melting all his rich influences together to one amazing sound .
pos	For the life of me , why did this film receive an R rating ? ! While it IS about flesh - eating zombies , believe it or not , it 's actually a pretty good family - friendly film -- at least if your kids are age 10 and older . Unlike the traditional zombie films , this one has an excellent sense of humor as well as a traditional values -- albeit a bit twisted ! The language is n't a serious problem , there is no nudity and the film style is definitely geared towards kids ( much like the old TV show " Eerie , Indiana")--yet some knucklehead slapped an R rating one it ! Believe me , most kids have seen worse violence than this and it just seems silly to make audiences think this is an adults only film . The story is set in a parallel - type world . While the fashions , cars and mores appear circa 1953 , in this bizarro world there has been a fierce recent zombie plague that resulted in the " zombie war " and massive changes in everyday life . At school , kids are trained in armed combat and there 's a cute scene late in the film where the father gives his son a handgun and tells him to keep it in his backpack " just in case " ! As for life outside of school , it 's pretty weird as well , as people now have learned that zombies AREN'T such a bad thing ! Heck , using shock collars and training , they can be made into slaves who can do your housework , clean streets , deliver milk or , in the case of a really sick guy , be your " special friend " . This film deals with one particular family that finally buys their first zombie slave ( played by Billy Connally ) . Mom is thrilled and her son slowly becomes the zombie 's friend . Dad , on the other hand , is n't convinced -- as he was forced years early to kill his own zombie father and he has n't yet gotten over this ! ! Funny , irreverent and unique -- this film needs to be seen by a much wider audience .
neg	Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal are already preparing a sequel about a young US corporal in Afghanistan . He also happens to be a highly - qualified surgeon and is roaming freely around Kabul , operating on wounded NATO soldiers . On a particularly difficult mission , he casually picks up a sniper rifle and shoots Osama Bin Laden from a distance of about 3000 yards . He is then finally promoted to sergeant , but is unable to decide between a sniper and surgeon career , so he quits from the Army altogether . One year later , frustrated with civilian life , he joins the Navy and the last scene shows him proudly wearing a white uniform .
pos	Grand Canyon is a very strange bird . It 's a completely unique urban piece , where relating the entire plot would fail to convey much . It 's central theme seems to be the inherent uncertainty life holds for people of every race , background and station . But to proclaim that THE theme of the film would be to horribly understate its scope . Similarly , to pigeonhole it in a particular genre is futile . The film has volumes to say , though likely different volumes for every viewer , and says it all in such a non - preachy way from so many angles , that in the end , i ca n't even define its central message for myself . Nevertheless , it does it 's business with such laser precision ; every prop , line of dialog , and bar of background music contributing to it 's pervasive mood and powerful message , that i 'm pleasantly surprised , and come away very thoughtful after every viewing . Still it does n't feel at all stuffy . A sparkling film with a great cast and everything working .
neg	This Drummond entry is lacking in continuity . Most of them have their elements of silliness , the postponed wedding , and so on . However , this has an endless series of events occurring in near darkness as the characters run from one place to another . The house seems more like a city . There 's also Leo G. Carrol who is such an obvious suspect who no - one seems to even look at . He is a stranger and acts rather suspicious , but Drummond and the folks do n't seem to pick up on anything . Still , it as reasonably good action and a pretty good ending . I know that Algie is supposed to be a comic figure , but like Nigel Bruce in the Rathbone Sherlock Holmes flicks , he is so buffoonish that it 's hard to imagine anyone with taste or intelligence being around him . Is there a history behind him that will explain how he and Drummond became associates ?
pos	Often tagged as a comedy , The Man In The White Suit is laying out far more than a chuckle here and there . Sidney Stratton is an eccentric inventor who is n't getting the chances to flourish his inventions on the world because nobody pays him notice , he merely is the odd ball odd job man about the place as it were . After bluffing his way into Birnley 's textile mill , he uses their laboratory to achieve his goal of inventing a fabric that not only never wears out , but also never needs to be cleaned!. He is at first proclaimed a genius and those who ignored him at first suddenly want a big piece of him , but then the doom portents of an industry going bust rears its head and acclaim quickly turns to something far more scary . Yes the film is very funny , in fact some scenes are dam hilarious , but it 's the satirical edge to the film that lifts it way above the ordinary to me . The contradictions about the advent of technology is a crucial theme here , do we want inventions that save us fortunes whilst closing down industries ? , you only have to see what happened to the coal industry in Britain to know what I 'm on about . The decade the film was made is a crucial point to note , the making of nuclear weapons became more than just hearsay , science was advancing to frighteningly new proportions . You watch this film and see the quick turnaround of events for the main protagonist Stanley , from hero to enemy in one foul swoop , a victim of his own pursuit to better mankind ! , it 's so dark the film should of been called The Man In The Black Suit . I honestly ca n't find anything wrong in this film , the script from Roger MacDougall , John Dighton , and director Alex Mackendrick could be filmed today and it would n't be out of place such is the sharpness and thought of mind it has . The sound and setting is tremendous , the direction is seamless , with the tonal shift adroitly handled by Mackendrick . Some of the scenes are just wonderful , one in particular tugs on the heart strings and brings one to think of a certain scene in David Lynch 's Elephant Man some 29 years later , and yet after such a downturn of events the film still manages to take a wink as the genius that is Alec Guinness gets to close out the film to keep the viewers pondering not only the future of Stanley , but also the rest of us in this rapidly advancing world . A timeless masterpiece , thematically and as a piece of art , 10/10 .
neg	Hunters chase what they think is a man through the forest , though the audience sees he is a werewolf . The hunters never seem to realize this , because after they shoot him , he looks normal when they decapitate him . A doctor transplants the werewolf 's eyes into a man who lost his own in a laboratory experiment . The man , Rich , gets to have sex with his nurse ( Stephanie Beaton ) before he even gets his bandages removed . After he leaves the hospital , he finds his wife has been cheating on him too . When a smoke machine sends clouds past an amateur painting of a moon ( with a fake tree branch on the foreground ) , he turns into a werewolf ! His torso grows larger , splitting his shirt , and he grows a giant werewolf mask on his head that has red lights in the eyes . His pants stay intact . The mouth chews unconvincingly , though some sort of robotics ( or hidden hands ) in the eyebrows give him a baleful look at times . Despite the poor werewolf costume , there is a fair amount of blood and gore , and those are fairly well done . There 's even a pretty good decapitation later in the movie . However , when a man falls from a height , a rather bad dummy does the job . Rich has a friend named Siodmak who is some sort of occult expert , and he also accidentally stumbles across a small man with crutches named Androse who is also such an expert . They try to help him a little . Rich kills people who have done him wrong . A policewoman investigates the murders and tries to hit on Beaton , who does n't much care for lesbian scenes so nothing comes of it . Quite cheap , but between the nudity and blood and gore , and a not - terrible story combining ( sort of ) The Most Dangerous Game with The Hands of Orlac and The Wolf Man , it 's somewhat entertaining . Available on its own , or in the box set Scream Queens Vol . 1 .
pos	This show has a few clichés and a few over the top , Dawson 's Creek - like moments ( a 16-year - old talking about way back when life made sense ? ) , but overall it seems like a decent show . Most of the characters seem very real , and the story seemed to move along well in the pilot - ending with a good lesson in the end . I just hope every episode does n't turn out to be life - altering like the first , that would just be too much drama for this vehicle . Jeremy Sumpter does an excellent job as a teenager with a passion for baseball , I believe a lot of us could relate to his awe and sometimes tunnel vision for the team that he always wanted to a part of .
neg	The characters are unlikeable and the script is awful . It 's a waste of the talents of Deneuve and Auteuil .
pos	I must admit , this is one of my favorite horror films of all time . The unique way that John Carpenter has directed this picture , opening the door to so many mock - genres , it will chill you to the bone whether it is your first time watching it or your fiftieth . The sound , the menacing horror of Michael Meyers and the infamous scream of Jamie Lee Curtis gives this film instant cult status and a great start for the independent era . I love the music , I love the characters , the familiar yet spooky setting , the simplistic nature of the villain , and the random chaos of it all . There is no really rhyme or reason to the killing in this first film , giving us a taste of Michael 's true nature . Is he insane , or in some way just a very brilliant beast ? That question may never be truly answered , but Carpenter gives us his 100 % and more devotion to this amazing masterpiece . John Carpenter is the master of horror . While lately his films have not been the caliber that they once were ( see Ghosts of Mars ) , Halloween began his powerhouse of a career . This is his ultimate film . While he did release other greats , I will always remember this one as the film that caused me to turn on all the lights , beware when babysitting , and check behind closed doors , because you never knew where the evil would appear next . Carpenter has this amazing ability to bring you into the world in which he weaves . With the power of his camera , he places these images of Meyers in places you least expected while giving you the perception as if the murderer is right next to you . I loved every scene in which we panned back and there was Michael , watching from the distance , without anyone the wiser . That was scary , yet utterly brilliant . I loved the scenes in which Carpenter pulled your fright from nearly thin air . There you would be , minding your own business , when suddenly that horrid mask would appear out of nowhere . Like the characters , you too thought it was just a trick of the eye , but that is where Carpenter gets you , it is n't . Michael is n't a ghost , he is a human being ( or at least we think ) , yet he has a stronger mental ability than most of the main characters . This leads into some really dark themes and unexplored symbolism , but even without that , this is a spooky film . Then , if you just did n't have enough of Michael just vaporizing in the windows of your house , Carpenter adds that chilling theme music . I still have that tapping of the piano keys in my mind , constantly wondering if Meyers is looking at me through the window . Carpenter has found the perfect combination of visual frights and chilling sounds to foreshadow what may happen to our unsuspecting victims next . It is lethal , and it is done with refreshing originality and more unique thrills than anything released by today 's Horror Hollywood could muster . Carpenter 's Halloween is a breath of fresh air in the midst of what could be a rough horror year , with actual scares being replaced by Paris Hilton , you know that the quality is n't quite the same . Finally , I would like to say that even the simplistic nature of the opening murder in this film is terrifying and chilling . The use of the " clown " mask sent shivers up my spine . The way that it was filmed with that elongated one shot using the child 's mask as if it were our own eyes is still one of the best horror openings ever ! It completely sets the tone for the remainder of that film . You have the babysitter theme , you have the childish behavior which carries with Michael throughout the film , and you have the art talent of Carpenter all rolled into one . I could literally speak for hours upon hours about this film , but instead I would rather go watch it again . It is worth the repeat visit many times !   Overall , I think this is one of the most outstanding films in cinematic history . Skip all those foreign films that think that they are going to chance the face of movies leave it to a budget tight Carpenter and the slasher film genre . This singular movie redefined a whole generation of horror films , and still continues to be an influence on modern - day horror treats . The lethal combination of a genuinely spooky murderer , the powerful cinematography of the events ( which normally does n't amount to much in horror films ) , and the beauty of Jamie Lee Curtis is exactly what makes Halloween that film above the rest . Sure , Freddy is cool and you feel sympathetic for Jason , but Michael is real , he is troubled , and he is on the loose lusting for the blood of babysitters . What can be better ?   Grade : * * * * * out of * * * * *
neg	Am not familiar with the trilogy but came upon this film last night on Showtime . The film looked very well done with the set design and the cinematography , but the screenplay was stilted and wooden . The acting was fairly bad- thought the two female leads were serviceable . You never really believed anything the supporting actors said though . There were the stereotypes- bible - thumping Reverend without a hint of nuance , authoritative Captain , hot - headed soldier , etc . I am sorry to say that based on these deficiencies I clocked it straight away as Canadian without knowing it to be such - the Telefilm Canada end credits gave it away . I know I 'm a horrible person . Maybe I missed something in the beginning but the hostility towards the girls is never explained . Here they are besieged in a fort by werewolves and the men are wasting time and energy brutalizing two young women for no reason . FOCUS people . There 's a bit more of a pressing situation beyond your walls than whether or not these girls are lesbians - that 's just my inference for the hostility directed towards them . If they can aim and fire a gun you might as well make nice with them . The question of their " immortal soul " can be resolved later . Also , I guess this relates to the rest of the trilogy , these girls are supposed to be the protagonists ? One of them murdered the Indian guy at the end that saved one of their lives . I guess one is just a victim of her condition who ca n't be necessarily blamed for her actions , but the other is just a murderer who does n't deserve her happy ending .
pos	Every kid has that movie that he pops into VHS when he has nothing to do , or when there is a babysitter around . This was that movie for me .   I can tell you the whole plot exactly , I must have seen it 100 times at least , and I can say it is a good kids / family movie . I still have the tape , I have n't watched it in 5 years , but maybe I 'll get around to it this week , and be a kid for the day .   You just have to love the care bears , and their messege .
neg	I have a high tolerance level for crap , so I was looking forward to this . It did not disappoint . Apparently based on Sheridan Le Fanu 's classic Carmilla , it follows a father and daughter hunting a female vampire who , luckily , happens to be travelling with them . Then we have Santa Claus ( or the General , as he likes to be called here ) running over random zombies . Did I mention there was a zombie outbreak ? The dead are returning to life but nobody seems too concerned . We have construction worker zombies , soldier zombies and even St . Trinian schoolgirl zombies . Apparently Santa Claus is looking for his daughter who has been turned into a vampire . Oh wait there are no vampires , the girl is in a lunatic asylum and Carmilla is her nurse , or is she ? The zombies are back and Santa 's mad . Lesbian sex , I like vampires and I like zombies but I especially like lesbian sex . Nothing like some simulated cunnilingus to get the juices flowing . When are we going to see vampires fight zombies ? Is she a vampire or is she a lunatic ? Or both ? Is Carmilla a hot sexy lesbian vampire or a nurse ? More cunnilingus , you can never have enough cunnilingus . Here come the St . Trinian zombies . Chainsaw time ! ! More lesbian sex then the zombies kill and eat the vampires . I guess the zombies won , or did they ? Plot ? Who needs a plot when you 've got lesbian vampires and schoolgirl zombies ? And cunnilingus ?
pos	A very engaging , intelligent , and well - made film . Liam Neeson and Tim Roth play their roles superbly . The cinematography is outstanding . The fight scenes are amazing . This is a film I will enjoy watching again and again . One of my favorites .
neg	" Kings and Queen " is a bloated French drama that rambles on for an interminable two hours and thirty - two minutes to no discernible point or purpose . The film features two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect with one another about halfway through the movie . The first centers around Nora and her struggles with various men in her life , including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live . The other story involves a young man named Ismael , a violinist who finds himself placed - unfairly , he believes - in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party . After traveling along on separate tracks for awhile , these two narrative strands eventually come together when we learn that Ismael is a former lover of Nora 's and the man she has chosen to adopt her son from an earlier , tragic relationship . With a bit more focus and a considerable amount of streamlining , " Kings and Queen " might have been a potent , engrossing drama about modern day relationships . It certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power , and the performances are , for the most part , complex and touching . But , taken as a whole , the film meanders and maunders to such an extent that , quite frankly , it begins to wreak havoc on our patience and to wear out its welcome early on . Even more distressing is the fact that , even though we spend what seems like a mild eternity in the company of these people , we really do n't know quite what to make of any of them when the show is finally over . For instance , Nora 's father , on his deathbed , writes a withering diatribe against his daughter 's character that simply does n't gibe with the woman we 've been looking at for well over two hours . Nora is admittedly no Mother Theresa ( then , again , who is ? ) , but she certainly does n't deserve the invective thrown at her by her very own father . Nora could be accused of being confused , indecisive , a bit self - absorbed at times , but evil enough to have her father wishing he could give her his cancer and make her die in his place ? I do n't think so . Perhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that I was unable to fathom . But my suspicion is that even writer Roger Bohbot and co - writer / director Arnaud Desplechin would have trouble fully explaining their purpose here . This is a well acted , pretentious bore of a film that takes the viewer on a long , rambling voyage through a sea of personal crises , a journey that leaves him no wiser or more enlightened at the end than he was at the beginning .
pos	I really wanted to like this film and I do n't think I was terribly disappointed . Being an American History teacher , I felt an obligation , almost , to see this film and as far as the history went , it was n't bad . Sure there were a few mistakes here and there ( especially with the timeline -- the movie only appeared to last a few months or perhaps a year -- not over six years of actual fighting ) , but the overall spirit of the film and the battle sequences were excellent . Unfortunately , the movie ALSO included a pretty meaningless subplot involving a difficult to believe romance between a poor patriot and a rich Loyalist . For the most part , it really served to distract from the overall plot and just seemed " tacked on "-- like a plot device instead of a real honest - to - goodness romance . In fact , as much of the romance boiled down to the dumb cliché of " love at fist sight " , it was kind of annoying the more I think about it . However , in spite of this romance , the film is truly interesting and inspiring --- plus , in so many ways it seems as if the much later film , THE PATRIOT , was copied from this Griffith film ! ! ! Both films followed the exploits of an evil leader fighting for the British and using horrible and evil tactics against the civilians -- and both having the secret intention of using this as a " springboard " to starting their OWN nation in the America ! ! ! The only major difference is that this film is set in the North and THE PATRIOT was in the Carolinas . It sure would have been nice if Mel Gibson and the rest had acknowledged their debt to D. W. Griffith for the story ideas . It just does n't seem all that likely that the two stories were created independently of each other . PS -- Despite me liking this film and some other of Griffith 's films , he DOES deserve to once again " burn in hell " for his having White actors portray all the Black servants in the film ! This is a sick and bigoted thing that Griffith did in so many of his films -- especially in BIRTH OF A NATION . I got ta assume based on this and the way he portrays Blacks that he was A - OK with slavery and was quite the apologist for this " quaint institution " ( do n't get mad at me -- this IS meant as sarcasm ) .
neg	Within the realm of Science Fiction , two particular themes consistently elicit interest , were initially explored in the literature of a pre - cinematic era , and have since been periodically revisited by filmmakers and writers alike , with varying degrees of success . The first theme , that of time travel , has held an unwavering fascination for fans of film , as well as the written word , most recently on the screen with yet another version of the H.G. Wells classic , ` The Time Machine . ' The second theme , which also manages to hold audiences in thrall , is that of invisibility , which sparks the imagination with it 's seemingly endless and myriad possibilities . And this theme , too , has again become the basis for a film adapted from another H.G. Wells classic , ` The Invisible Man , ' the realization of which , here , is ` Hollow Man , ' directed by Paul Verhoeven , and starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue . Sebastian Caine ( Bacon ) and his colleagues have for some time been conducting experiments for the U.S. Government , exploring the possibility and practicality of invisibility , which they have , at last , achieved in a number of the primates upon which they have tested their method . They have , in fact , progressed to the point that effecting the invisibility is assured ; their only problem now is bringing the subject back to the original ` visual ' state of being . It 's a problem , however , that Caine , after diligent effort and too many hours in the lab , has solved-- or so he thinks . And when the application of his theory on a live subject is successful , he decides to present the results to the board of directors , in an effort to thereby maintain the funding necessary for the continuation of the project . At the last minute , though , Caine demurs , fearing that control of the project will be wrested from him before they can proceed to the next level-- the testing of a human subject . And he takes it upon himself to become that subject , securing the assistance of his research team by telling them that they 've been given approval by the board to do so . But something goes wrong , and Caine becomes trapped in his cloak of invisibility ; and as he and his team struggle to find the solution to his considerable dilemma before it 's too late , it all begins to take a toll on Caine 's mind . And suddenly , his fear of losing funding and control becomes inconsequential , as he finds himself facing the imminent danger of losing much more than that . Now there 's a very real chance that he may lose everything-- Including himself . Verhoeven has crafted what is initially an exciting , even thought provoking film ; he establishes a good pace and uses the F / X at his disposal to great effect , though he does tend to allow the striking visuals to overwhelm the character development . Anyone familiar with ` The Invisible Man , ' or actually anyone who can logically follow the progression of the story , will know early on that Caine is not destined for happier times . Still , Verhoeven has a style of storytelling that is definitely going to capture the attention and engage his audience . But he seems bent on rushing toward the climax , and along the way he abandons any and all of the nuance that has made his film thus far successful , opting to enter into a final sequence that is nothing more than a mindless blood - and - gore fest that betrays his audience and everything he 's worked for earlier in the film . Rather than seeking an intelligent resolution to Caine 's suffering , and using some inventiveness and imagination to take the film to it 's inevitable conclusion , Verhoeven takes the low road , and though it may succeed on a purely visceral level , any meaning one could derive from the story dissolves like so many ashes in the wind , along with anything that would have made this a memorable film . And it 's a shame , because Verhoeven has it at a higher level than much of what is offered in this genre , and he allows it to sink unnecessarily to one much lower . Kevin Bacon does a good job of creating a character that is believable , if only on the surface , which seemingly serves Verhoeven 's purposes perfectly . There 's little depth to Bacon 's portrayal , but it has more to do with his director 's agenda than his own acting abilities . Verhoeven simply does not allow Bacon the time to develop Caine to any extent ; the character is mainly a vessel around which Verhoeven can build his story , and toward that end , it works . The film would have been better served , however , had Verhoeven and Bacon collaborated more closely on at least developing a bond between Caine and the audience that would have prompted some emotional involvement on the viewers part , something that would have drawn them in a bit , rather than leaving them at the gate , as it were , as mere observers of an F / X laden extravaganza . Elisabeth Shue comports herself well in the role of Linda McKay , Caine 's willing accomplice in the ill - fated experiment , but it 's basically a thankless part that offers little challenge , especially to an actor of Shue 's caliber . The same can be said of Kim Dickens ( so magnificent in the 2001 film , ` Things Behind the Sun ' ) . Her character , Sarah Kennedy , does little more than support the action and F / X. Both actors are capable of so much more , and deserve better than what they are given to work with here . The supporting cast includes Josh Brolin ( Matthew ) , Greg Grunberg ( Carter ) , Joey Slotnick ( Frank ) , Mary Randle ( Janice ) and William Devane ( Dr. Kramer ) . Entertaining to a point , and even successful on a certain ( low ) level , ` Hollow Man ' is one of those films that leaves you contemplating what could have been . Like an annual fireworks display , it will give you some momentary thrills , but after awhile it 'll begin to blend in with all the others you 've seen , without anything special to set it apart . And it 's too bad , because given the talent and abilities of those involved here , it could have been so much more . I rate this one 4/10 .     
pos	After dipping his toes in the giallo pool with the masterful film " The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh " ( 1971 ) , director Sergio Martino followed up that same year with what turns out to be another twisty suspense thriller , " The Case of the Scorpion 's Tail . " Like his earlier effort , this one stars handsome macho dude George Hilton , who would go on to star in Martino 's Satanic / giallo hybrid " All the Colors of the Dark " the following year . " Scorpion 's Tail " also features the actors Luigi Pistilli and Anita Strindberg , who would go on to portray an unhappy couple ( to put it mildly ! ) in Martino 's " Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key " ( 1972 ) . ( I just love that title ! ) I suppose Edwige Fenech was busy the month they shot this ! Anyway , this film boasts the stylish direction that Martino fans would expect , as well as a twisty plot , some finely done murder set pieces , and beautiful Athenian location shooting . The story this time concerns an insurance investigator ( Hilton ) and a journalist ( Strindberg , here looking like Farrah Fawcett 's prettier , smarter sister ) who become embroiled in a series of grisly murders following a plane crash and the inheritance of $ 1 million by a beautiful widow . I really thought I had this picture figured out halfway through , but I was dead wrong . Although the plot does make perfect sense in this giallo , I may have to watch the film again to fully appreciate all its subtleties . Highlights of the picture , for me , were Anita 's cat - and - mouse struggle with the killer at the end , a particularly suspenseful house break - in , and a nifty fight atop a tiled roof ; lots of good action bursts in this movie ! The fine folks at No Shame are to be thanked for still another great - looking DVD , with nice subtitling and interesting extras . Whotta great outfit it 's turned out to be , in its ongoing quest to bring these lost Italian gems back from oblivion .
neg	Stereotyped , derivative , unoriginal and boring Western . The two popular stars ( Charlton Heston and James Coburn ) both give performances that are far from their best , and justifiably so ; they both have superficial roles and character traits stated mainly by dialogue . Heston is a sheriff who " liked the world better as it used to be before " and Coburn is an outlaw who " owes something to the man who locked him up and has to pay his debt " . Additionally , Heston is so old that he has trouble riding a horse and Coburn is mean and tough but not as cold - blooded a killer as some of the minor villains . Apparently , the filmmakers could n't come up with even ONE original idea about how to make this movie somewhat distinguished . ( * 1/2 )
pos	Enjoyable in spite of Leslie Howard 's performance . Mr. Howard plays Philip as a flat , uninteresting character . One is supposed to feel sorry for this man ; however , I find myself cheering Bette Davis ' Mildred . Ms. Davis gives one her finest performances ( she received an Academy Award nomination ) . Thanks to her performance she brings this rather dull movie to life . * * Be sure not to miss when Mildred tells Philip exactly how she feels about him .
neg	Opening scene ' explains ' why Hurt is later ' immune ' to the ' Contaminated Man ' . Too bad it does n't explain anything else : How did he get whatever he ' caught'/what was it / why does it work so fast . Then we go to " Present Day Budapest " . OK , was the opener in the past or the future ? It turns out to be the past , of course , but for a minute it looks just as likely to be the nd of the movie moved to the beginning . Sorry , I should have paid closer attention , huh ? Or maybe it 's just badly done . Then a lot of confusion about the different jobs he 's had in related fields , and finally a mention about how he should have died from the original experiment the n s a did on him . Aha ! So the n s a and private industry got together to poison one of their top guys to watch the effects ? He must have been one of the top guys , he 's friends with the c e o of the Chemical company , for God sakes . Then there 's the substance itself : Technically a poison , but it mutates in immune ' carriers ' , so we can have whatever we want ; a poison , a disease , an allergic reaction , all very different things in real life . Magically , it 's not contagious from one dying victim to another , only from the carrier . How convenient . Then there 's the h a z m a t protocol : They jump into a situation without having any idea what 's in store , or how prepare for it . Did the producers not have enough money to show a proper wash - down after the crew just left the scene of a deadly unknown substance ? I kept thinking Hurt was going to die from bad cleanup technique , and the open scene would turn out to be the closer after all .
pos	Best show since Seinfeld . She 's really really funny . Her total self centeredness , the hulking gay stoner neighbors , the departures into song or cartoons , make this the freshest show on TV . One of the few shows I make point of watching . The scene with the wise old black lady in the drugstore ( " oh wait now that you 're close you do look old " turns face with finger and walks away lol ) , the cough syrup overdose , sleeping with God , it 's all so funny or so stupid it 's just a lot of fun . The shows weak points are her sister and the cop - only because they 're too darn normal ! ! I really ca n't wait until the next show , something I have n't felt for any show in a long time .
neg	Sorry . Someone has to say it . This really is / was a dull movie . Worthy perhaps , but dull nonetheless . I nearly cried with boredom when watching it . The acting is pretty dire , the story drawn out and predictable , the score and camera - work totally standard and unexciting . It 's one of those movies you are not allowed to hate ( becase it is about disabled people ) but hate it I suspect nearly everyone does . It is interesting that critics have been so kind to this movie . I suppose they too are not allowed to be objective . This was made to win awards - which I remember it duly did . But it was neither interesting nor entertaining . I have n't seen the play so can not compare .
pos	I happened upon this movie as an 8 - 10 year old on a cold , dark November afternoon . I was outside playing all day , freezing , and when I came in around 4 pm , I had a cup of hot cocoa and sat down in front of the TV with a blanket . I was surprised to be watching a cartoon that was n't all happy and silly -- and was in fact dark , and moralistic . It captured my imagination . I 'm sure it misses the text , and is abbreviated in all the wrong places for the Tolkien purist . But it still captures the spirit of the story , the choice to carry a burden for the good of others , the consequences of selfish , rash decisions , etc . The quality of animation leaves room for complaint . But the one place where this movie clearly rises above the new films is the voice characterizations . John Hurt is great in this . If you do n't like how the character is drawn , look away , and just listen to him . His voice is extraordinary . I 've seen it again many , many times and it always brings me back to that time , as a kid , thirsty for some magical adventure . It 's for this reason I say ' lucky ' , the film is nostalgic for me so I overlook its shortcomings . But between John Hurt , and Tolkien 's fantasy , it still reached me , and still does .
neg	This film was very well advertised . I am an avid movie goer and have seen previews for this movie for months . While I was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be , my friends thought it was going to be great and hyped me up about it . Then I went and saw it , I was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until I remembered that I had paid for this movie . I made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i would nt feel bad and destroy the good mood I was in , plus I wanted to get my monies worth out of the movie ! I always go into a movie with an open mind , not trying to go into them with too many expectations , but this movie was not that funny . Now it was nt the worst movie I 've ever seen , but it is definitely worth waiting for HBO . If you have nt seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it , but for true comedy fans I d say pass . Maybe even check out The Kings of Comedy again . Something told me to go see Meet the Parents instead ! ! !
pos	When this film was made , the hippie thing had gone mainstream . The ideas of the counter culture was well established , that is why such a big film could be made . Yet it has something to say , and it is said really beautifully . Apart from those who 're only waiting for the wanking material , this film is given credit for its beautiful scenes(which in itself is more than enough reason to see the film ) by the most . The soundtrack to this film , which actually became more popular than the film itself , is another plus . Pink Floyd 's " Careful with that axe Eugene " suits really well with the explosions , the absence of music in other scenes gives the film a nice quiet mood . But . It seems as though the messages in this film have been overlooked by the most . If you did n't understand it , which seems to be the case for the most , I 'll give you some hints : The man(tough guy , what ever his name is - Mark ? ) is a part of a " reality group " . He leaves this group saying something like " I 'm willing to die . But not of boredom " He later go for a joyride with a stolen plane , probably to seek some action . As he is in the air , Grateful Dead 's Dark Star(from the Live / Dead album ) is played(i think ) . This song contains the phrase " Shall we go you and I while we can " , this is though not heard in the film.(Perhaps stretching it a bit too far meaning that quote is essential ? ) In the plane , he checks up a girl(Daria ) , who is driving in her car to a conference(about giving typical suburban families the opportunity to live in a super - relaxing place in the desert , where everything is so simple and nice . For the whole family ! ) , by diving down , almost hitting the car . He lands the plane , and joins the girl on her way to Detroit . They stop at Zabriskie point , where they enjoy each other as living creatures and the nature . Later a family with a big car(of the type which you sleep in ) and a speed boat is showed visiting Zabriskie Point , the father saying something like " what a waste driving all the way up here " , and the kid sitting inside the car , grinning . I sensed a " this was n't much better than on the telly "- attitude . Daria takes Mark back to the plane which now is painted in a psychedelic style , with the identity number changed to " no war " on one side and " no words " on the other . " Bucks Sucks " is also written on the plane . Mark takes the plane back to where he stole it from , saying to Daria before he leaves " I do n't risk anything " or something , one of several hints about he not caring too much about his destiny . ( This because he has the feeling that the environment that surrounds do n't give him anything- " I wonder what happens in the real world " ) On the airport he is met by police officers who shoots him even though he just has returned the plane . Daria hears this on the radio , but decides to go to the conference in the fancy mansion . Here she feels alien after the adventures with her just killed friend . She enjoys fresh water running down a rock , more than the swimming pool . Inside the house the viewer is once again given a hint about anti - materialism -She looks out through a glass wall , holding her hands on the glass like she was trapped . The business men is seen arguing , the one side eager to make a big deal , the other afraid of losing money . Daria leaves the house and looks back at it , visualizing it blowing up . After the house , several other things blow up , for example a television . She smiles , happy she has inside herself destroyed what she after the meeting with Mark look upon as something negative . To summarize : Mark obviously experience the " reality group " as not very useful as they just sit and talk , taking no action . He clearly has bad feelings about things being as they are , and it seems like he feels that it 's no use fighting against it . He wants to leave . He helps Daria , who is " in mind but not in action " seeing his point of view . Where his feeling of being misfitted turns out leading to his death , one can hope Daria uses the ideas in a way that will turn out more constructive . In the film you see how a town ( LA ) is being polluted by commercial ( too bad you have to show the commercial to make the point ) , you see business men deciding what is the future , et cetera , and you see people being unhappy with these and other situations which is parts of the modern world . I have only seen the film once , so I have not caught all points , but I certainly got a feeling of what this film has to say , and I find it strange that this film can be called meaningless . If you say the points are being too obvious , I can see why , this film probably intended to appeal to the post - hippie radicals " digging " the thoughts of anti - establishment . Even though , it has a lot to say , and its message is still needed today , things pretty much evolving in the same direction as it did before the sixties . Zabriskie Point is a really great film , telling a story about quite normal young people ( not far out hippies tripping around tip toe on acid , digging everything ) seeking what they percept as real , dissatisfied with the conventional . And it is done in a truly beautiful way .
neg	This whirling movie looks more like a combination of music - clips at MTV than as a real movie . There is no real story and as the movie goes on you ask yourself : " What is going to happen ? " ; but nothing happens . The story around Eric Cloeck , the frustrated writer , is the only good thing . The other persons seem to have nothing in common : then why bring them together in a movie . With music you can make watchable the worst movie . When I open the tap and there comes water out with the music of Bach then most people will like to look at it but this is not a movie . The director should learn how to write a script for a movie of 100 minutes or more before starting to direct a movie .
pos	Diane and I saw this fabulous film today in Fremantle and we both agreed that of the pastiche movies it was head and shoulders above the rest . I say that because we were entranced by the brief , five to ten minute segments that composed the film and the fact that this film had a theme around which each piece was composed and of course that theme was love in its many forms . Ostensibly the film took place in the various Parisian arrondisments thus giving a particular flavour to each segment . Having only been in Paris several times , I was not knowledgeable enough to readily recognize the locations but I am sure Europeans and particularly French people could easily recognize the city 's locations . In any event , the viewer is immediately pulled into each story because of their production excellence so these city locations fade into in - consequence . The film moves quickly and the viewer is left absorbing one scenario while the new one is on the screen . The stories themselves are not graphic like some pulp Hollywood nonsense , they are subtle and thought provoking and gentle as with most of life without the media swath that buries so much of life 's beauty under the nearest dung heap just to sell , sell . sell ... Go with someone you care for and allow this magical little film to bathe you like a spa treatment and when you leave my guess is you will feel renewed .
neg	All of David Prior 's movies are terrible on all counts : bad writing , bad acting , bad cinematography , no budget ( the director 's brother is usually cast as the male lead ) . But they all have incredible entertainment value because of their unintentional hilarity . The plot of almost every David Prior " film " ( as I like to refer to them ) is basically the same . Manly all - American commandos team up to blow up Communist baddies . But unlike other Cold War - era garbage such as Red Dawn , Prior 's movies are actually funny because of their over - the - top premises and acting . The best part of Jungle Assault is the scene in which Becker ( or was is the other dude ? ) is being summoned by General Mitchell for a top - secret mission in South America . The funniest line in the movie is then delivered , something to the effect of " this is my roommate , I trained him well " . WHAT . You trained your roommate ? And apparently this is going to be their solution to avoiding eviction . If you can find these gems on video used anywhere , BUY THEM . They are all funny and even funnier after a few beers . Watch them with a group of your friends for a true MST3K - style experience . So far my friends and I have managed to get a hold of Night Wars and Aerobicide aka " Killer Workout " . But the one I recommend the most over them all is Final Sanction , with the freakish - looking Robert Z'dar .
pos	Despite a tight narrative , Johnnie To 's Election feels at times like it was once a longer picture , with many characters and plot strands abandoned or ultimately unresolved . Some of these are dealt with in the truly excellent and far superior sequel , Election 2 : Harmony is a Virtue , but it 's still a dependably enthralling thriller about a contested Triad election that bypasses the usual shootouts and explosions ( though not the violence ) in favour of constantly shifting alliances that can turn in the time it takes to make a phone call . It 's also a film where the most ruthless character is n't always the most threatening one , as the chilling ending makes only too clear : one can imagine a lifetime of psychological counselling being necessary for all the trauma that one inflicts on one unfortunate bystander . Simon Yam , all too often a variable actor but always at his best under To 's direction , has possibly never been better in the lead , not least because Tony Leung 's much more extrovert performance makes his stillness more the powerful .
neg	Peter Fonda is so intentionally enervated as an actor that his lachrymose line - readings cancel out any irony or humor in the dialogue . He trades sassy barbs and non - witty repartee with Brooke Shields as if he were a wooden block with receding hair ; even his smaller touches ( like fingering a non - existent mustache on his grizzled face ) do n't reveal a character so much as an unsure actor being directed by himself , an unsure filmmaker . In the Southwest circa 1950 , a poor gambler ( not above a little cheating ) wins an orphaned , would - be teen Lolita in a botched poker game ; after getting hold of a treasure map promising gold in the Grand Canyon , the bickering twosome become prospectors . Some lovely vistas , and an odd but interesting cameo by Henry Fonda as a grizzled canyon man , are the sole compensations in fatigued comedy - drama , with the two leads being trailed by cartoonish killers who will stop at nothing until they get their hands on that map . Shields is very pretty , but -- although the camera loves her pouty , glossy beauty -- she has no screen presence ( and her tinny voice has no range whatsoever ) ; every time she opens her mouth , one is inclined to either cringe or duck . * 1/2 from * * * *
pos	when i saw the movie at first i thought that it was boring because nothing was happening but when all the scary things started to happen like when church dies and is brought back to life and also gage and his mom die and there idiot dad has to bring them back to life even though he nows the warnings and ignores Jud.this is not Steven kings best work . i thought that his best work was the shining . i do n't think that people who see this movie and comment on how awful it was are wrong because all they think is that what were they thinking . as if that person can do a better job in making a horror flick . i mean making the gage evil and how he kills Jud is genius . making the most innocent most unsuspecting character into one of the killers is cool . people who did n't like the movie are dumb because all it is a scary movie and nothing all . do n't expect something from a movie that it is n't . it still in a general area was n't that good . i still recommend people to watch the movie
neg	' P ' ( or Club - P ) should really be called ' L ' for lame . Every festival has a disappointment and this is the one that fails to live up to its much - hyped logline : " Thai lesbians fighting monsters . " Rather , this is the tale of a Khmer country girl who 's grandmother has taught her a little witchcraft along with a few odd ( but specific ) rules : " do n't walk under a clothesline , " " do n't eat raw meat , " and " do n't accept money for your powers . " Well , guess what folks , the girl moves to Bangkok to raise some money as a ' bar - girl ' and manages to break all the rules granny taught her which subsequently releases an evil spirit that conveniently kills the ' foreign johns ' who pay for her services . While this film ca n't even be released in Thailand due to it 's controversial subject matter most American audiences will find this ho - hum horror pic a cross between " Showgirls " and " Interview with the Vampire " as directed by Walt Disney . If not for a few scenes with significant amounts of blood the MPAA could probably rate this for pre - teens only . There is literally broadcast TV adult fare , although you 'd expect at least a sex scene considering the fact that the film is about a brothel and one of the actresses is a Thai porn star in real life . As for the ' lesbian ' angle , there 's one brief smooch and a couple of " I love you 's " to prove that the two main stars really are a couple ( on brother ) . And the P - bar has got to be the only exotic dance club on the planet where the girls keep their sarongs on and do carnival stunts ( there 's a swordsman who cuts cucumbers out of a girl 's mouth ... ooh , phallic imagery ) . NO nudity , NO real monster ( unless you count a five foot high Thai spirit with yellow eyes ) , and no way any ADULT should ever pay to see this kind of stupidity except on DVD . You 've been warned !
pos	This is an awesome action film with great one liners from Arnie!. It 's stylishly made , with lots of tense action to keep one satisfied . The Characters were awesome , and Richard Dawson , is very menacing as the main villain . Yes it has tons of plot holes , however it 's highly highly entertaining , with a great ending as well . It had a great story , too it , and Arnie and Maria Conchita Alonso had great chemistry together . The Character development was also pretty good , with , some superb performances . The Directing is great!. Paul Michael Glaser , does a very good job here , with awesome use of colors , keeping it stylish throughout , awesome camera angles , and overall keeping the film at a very fast pace ! good job . There is a little bit of gore . We get a few bloody gunshot wounds , exploding head , slit throat , bloody chainsaw slices , skinless corpses , blood , and an impaling . The Acting is great!. Arnold Schwarzenegger is AMAZING as always , he is excellent in the acting department , has tons of hilarious one liners , kicks that ass , and as always is a big physical presence ! , and was tons of fun to watch ! ( Arnie Rules ! ) . Maria Conchita Alonso , does well here , she was really cute , and had good chemistry with Arnie!. Yaphet Kotto , is decent here , with what he has to do , which is not much . Marvin J. McIntyre , is good as the geeky type guy , he was cool!. Richard Dawson is awesome as the main villain , and was very very menacing , and he was fun to watch . Jesse Ventura , Jim Brown , Erland van Lidth , Gus Rethwisch , and Professor Toru Tanaka , all do what they have to do very well as the stalkers . Overall a MUST see ! * * * * 1/2 out of 5
neg	I must agree with the very first comment : this movie sucks very , very hard . Despite having a very big B - list cast , the cover of this film ( for those who are n't watching it on Comedy Central during a weekday which is probably the only exposure this film will ever get ) tries to put the blame on Dangerfield but in reality is just a paycheck for every has - been comedian from the ' 80s . Randy Quaid ? Check . Ed Begley , Jr ? Check . The voice of Lisa Simpson ? She can now say that Maximum Overdrive was n't her only horrible flick : double check . And so many , many others . The saddest thing about this flick is that it was so lazily written with already - told jokes . Nothing about this movie outside of its existence is funny . You 're better off watching paint dry . This is definitely direct - to - video scraping - the - bottom - of - the - barrel stuff that still believes in the old video adage : throw an old - time star on the cover and you 'll get some money back off of the rental . Considering the days of video rental are changing , consider this one of the last examples of putting out garbage . The only use this movie has if you 're having trouble falling asleep . It 'll get you there .
pos	Up until the sixth and last episode of the Star Wars saga , which finally ended in 2005 , I had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long - running series . The varied action scenes and really different characters ( Jabba The Hut , furry woodland creatures , etc . ) made this a particularly appealing movie . None of the action ever focused too long in one spot , either . The last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser - duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader . Another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in - fighting between two of the stars . Gone was the incessant bickering between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford . Finally , everyone was on the same page ! It was nice to see . In the end , this was simply a wonderful adventure tale , more than anything else .
neg	Here again is yet another Diane Lane movie where she cheats on her husband . Is this the only role she knows how to play ? This time it 's set in 1969 and she cheats on her husband with the blouse man . I am so not surprised because that is so very predictable . Then her husband gets mad and throws the milk . I would n't be surprised if she slept with the milkman as well . I would n't be surprised if she slept with the ice cream man too because this is a very boring movie . Then after some milk throwing , she says sorry and sees the blouse man again . Duh . Then while she is making it with him , her son gets stung by wasps . My mom always told me not to throw rocks at a wasps nest . This kids mom did n't have time to tell him that , she was too busy with the blouse man .
pos	This film takes place in the 1950s . According to this the dead ( called zombies ) have arisen to eat the living . However a company has developed a collar that , when put around the zombies neck , makes them docile and perfect servants . The Robinsons mom Helen ( Carrie - Anne Moss ) , dad Bill ( Dylan Baker ) and son Timmy ( K'Sun Ray ) hire a zombie because everyone on their block already has one . Tim names the zombie Fido ( Billy Connolly ) and becomes friends with him . But his dad hates him and Timmy looses control of Fido and things go wrong . As you can see this is -- among many other things -- a takeoff on the " Lassie " series with Fido being a stand in for Lassie . Timmy was named that for a reason ! Every single of the famous Lassie episodes are spun here . My favorite is when Timmy sends Fido off to get help before the zombies eat him ! Also it 's a satire of those 1950s Douglas Sirk films where everything is bright and colorful -- but dark secrets are tearing people apart . The characters wear VERY bright 1950s clothes ( Moss is always in a dress)--the furnishings , settings and cars especially are all 1950s in hyper bright colors . Even when the script becomes repetitious there 's always something to look at . The script is good -- but there are only so many Lassie jokes you can make . The melodramatics are kind of silly but the cast pulls it off . Everyone here is excellent and right on target . Even Connolly as an emotionless zombie does a good job . Moss is the best -- playing each line for all its worth --- but never going overboard . This is n't for everybody ( of course ) . The satire may be lost on most people and the gore is pretty tame . The gore is done so casually and with happy music playing over it it 's hard to take it seriously . So , for some people , this will really work . I give it an 8 .
neg	I really looked forward to this program for two reasons ; I really liked Jan Michael Vincent and I am an aviation nut and have a serious love affair with helicopters . I do n't like this program because it takes fantasy to an unbelievable level . The world speed record for helicopters was set at 249 mph by a Westland Lynx several years ago . The only chopper that was ever faster was the experimental Lockheed AH56A in the 1960 's . It hit over 300 and was a compound helicopter , which means it had a pusher propeller at the end of its fuselage providing thrust . In short , no helicopter can fly much over 275 because of the principle of rotary wing flight . And the Bell 222 , the " actor " that portrayed Airwolf was n't very fast even by helicopter standards . And it did n't stay in production very long . There was a movie that came out during this time period called " Blue Thunder " that was much more realistic .
pos	Barbara Stanwyck as a real tough cookie , a waitress to the working classes ( and prostitute at the hands of her father ) who escapes to New York City and uses her feminine wiles to get a filing job , moving on to Mortgage and Escrow , and later as assistant secretary to the second in command at the bank . Dramatic study of a female character unafraid to be unseemly has lost none of its power over the years , with Barbara acting up a storm ( portraying a woman who learns to be a first - rate actress herself ) . Parlaying a little Nietzschean philosophy into her messed up life , this lady crushes out sentiment all right , but she never loses our fascination , our awe . She 's a plain - spoken , hard - boiled broad , but she 's not a bitch , nor is she a man - eater or woman - hater . This gal is all out for herself , and as we wait for her to eventually learn about real values in life , her journey up and down the ladder of success provides heated , sexy entertainment . John Wayne ( with thick black hair and too much eye make - up ) does well in an early role as the assistant in the file office , though all the supporting players are quite good . * * * from * * * *
neg	This was filmed back - to - back with the 1992 re - make of Conan Doyle 's famous novel ' The Lost World ' . And it shows . The film starts promisingly enough , with a ruthless organization intending to exploit the lost world and Challenger et al returning to defend the prehistoric plateau , but then things go downhill . Everybody is stranded on the plateau and we 're left with a feeble , boring , over - length rehash of the first film . The dinosaurs ( who are hardly ever seen ) are just laughable . Are we expected to take that cuddly toy that 's supposed to be an ankylosaur seriously ? And the tyrannosaur seems rooted to the spot . Do yourself a favor and get hold of the 1925 silent version of the Lost World . Unbelievably in this age of CGI and other advanced effects , the twenties version is the best and will remain so until somebody finally decides to do a decent re - make .
pos	Being a giant monster fan , me seeing " Yeti " was an absolute must , especially after hearing so much about it . Thanks to the good ' ol bootleg market I was able to find a copy pretty easily , and was happily surprised upon watching that this flick was actually , dare I say , decent . Decent for what it is , actually , namely a cheesy giant - monster flick . It kicks in pretty quickly as Yeti is found pretty much immediately , and we get introduced to various characters . They consist of some sleazy ones , some good ones , and a girl who is pretty much one of the most downright strikingly beautiful girls in any cheesy sci - fi film , by far . Yeti looks like a long - haired guy straight out of the original Woodstock concert , and really , he 's not that bad of a dude , especially after being introduced to the world in some kind of funky cage - like thing . Godzilla he is not - despite his rude awakening , he does n't even rampage ( actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture ) , but kinda just looks puzzled while trying to figure things out . Yeti seems to understand English pretty nicely ( my copy was dubbed in English ) and he knows who the good guys and bad guys are . However , we want to see the giant Yeti do his thing , and he 's pretty much in the whole movie , and in typical low - budget fashion , he seems to change size a lot depending on the scene and there 's even a bunch of the " fake legs " shots of him just standing there . Yes , the special effects are n't the greatest , but there are definitely some good ones here . A scene where Yeti smashes through a warehouse is done very well , and in another , he uses the windows of a building as " ladder steps " to climb down from the top of it - shattering each window with his foot and often shocking the occupants inside - in one sequence that really looks much , much better than it should in such a " bad " movie . " Yeti " never stoops as low as say , " A.P.E. " does . Actually the only time it even comes close to genuine silliness is when the beautiful girl causes Yeti 's nipple to become erect and he lifts his eyebrow in an " oh yeah baby " manner . But even this is n't that bad , and kinda even gets a laugh out of the viewer . The movie is pretty long for this kind of thing , but surprisingly enough it does n't get boring - the story is actually good , and just watching this utterly gorgeous actress on screen will make any male viewer happy . " Yeti " may not be in the upper echelon of giant monster flicks , but it is definitely better than other King Kong ' 76 rip - offs like " A.P.E. " and " Queen Kong " by very far .
neg	This movie was portrayed in the trailer as a comedy . It is an extreme tragedy . It left me sick to my stomach . I hated it . I think if they want to make a movie like this than they should be man enough to reflect the true intentions of the movie in the trailer . I would not have seen this movie if I would have known . I think the trailer should reflect the theme and intentions of a movie . I am tired of it . I really wanted to have a fun comedy and I am extremely disappointed . It has been several days now and I still have a bad taste in my mouth from this movie . I have never been more disappointed in a movie , nor have I ever written a comment on a bad movie . I really think that true deception was involved in this trailer because if they showed the true intention of the movie , no one would have seen it .
pos	Although this film put Davis on the map due to her brilliantly intense performance as the illiterate guttersnipe waitress / prostitute Mildred Rogers , this film is strangely unsatisfying to me as a whole . The acting is indeed fine in most every respect . What I can not fathom for the life of me is just how or why Phillip , a sensitive , well - bred young man would take the constant abuse this tramp constantly dishes out towards him : I find his naive tolerance quite ridiculously unbelievable in certain respects . Yes , I know he is a sensitive club - footed , introverted intellectual . But Davis is such a venomous witch that nobody that cultured would tolerate her attitude or actions and make it believable . Davis is astounding in her role : yes , she may go overboard in her histrionics now and then , but it 's a vividly creative portrayal any which way you look at it . Too bad she was n't playing a gangster 's moll . Her character would have been completely believable as a tramp among low - lifes !
neg	I have only seen Gretchen Mol in two other films ( Girl 6 , Donnie Brasco ) , and do n't really remember her , but she did a great job as a naive girl who posed for pictures because it made people happy . She really did n't think what she was doing was wrong , even when she left the business and found her religion again . The photos she made were certainly tame by today 's standards , and it is funny seeing men with cameras get all excited , and politicians pontificating on the evils of pornography . David Strathairn ( Good Night , and Good Luck ) played a super part here . Mary Harron ( American Psycho ) wrote and directed an outstanding biopic of the most famous pinup girl ever .
pos	Just as the new BSG was n't what fans of the original series were expecting , Caprica may not deliver what fans of the new BSG were expecting ( for the most part ) . It is a very interesting , if not somewhat self - involved show , or at least the pilot is . If you 're looking for the big CGI thrills of the ( new ) BSG , you 'll be sorely disappointed . If you liked the drama , you 'll probably find something you like and maybe even identify with . The storyline does examine on how the Cylons were developed , why Adama hates them and the origins of a monotheistic society . The writers also manage to tackle humans ' playing God(s ) ' and the creation or re - creation of ' human ' life . It will be interesting to see how this plays out . I found it to plod along in some parts and too preachy in others , but all in all it was promising . A small part of me wishes ( or hopes ) there might be some minor inklings of BSG in there ( aside from the back story I mentioned ) , but that would probably convolute the storyline too much . Like BSG , I 'll have to wait and see if Caprica grows on me , but it 's way too early to tell . It would really easy to chalk this up as a failure if you compare it to the previous series , but I 'm willing to give it a chance . Overall , I thought it was interesting enough to make me see how the actual series is before ' throwing in the ( proverbial ) towel ' .
neg	What an appalling piece of rubbish ! ! ! Who ARE all these people who blubber on about how good this is ? Yes , it 's " arty " ; and yes , it 's " foreign " , but .... that 's not enough . The plot is boring and disjointed , like a reality show but not so slickly made . The people are intrinsically uninteresting ; but as characters they do n't have enough depth to feel empathy for them . If they are based on real people then I feel very , very sorry for them . The violence ( and some of it is very violent ) seems quite ostentatious and gratuitous . It 's like the producer has visions of being Quenton Tarantino . Not that I think very much of him , either . And oh yes : if I had neighbours like these , I 'd move !
pos	It 's hard to watch this movie without thinking forward to the television show it would become , especially if , like me , you happen to like the TV show more . But there 's a lot to be said for the source . Oscar Madison ( Walter Matthau ) is a top New York City sportswriter who lives in an eight - room apartment by himself , a casualty of divorce and his own stubbornly sloppy mindset . Enter his friend Felix Ungar ( Jack Lemmon ) , needing a place to live after his wife threw him out for his stubbornly neatnik mindset . The result is a train wreck and one of the most beloved movie adaptations of a Neil Simon stage play . First thing 's first : I love that apartment ! Poker table , novelty dart board , askew photos of baseball players , empty booze and beer containers , even a pair of Roman columns . It 's a place where men can be boys . Simon and director Gene Saks do a great job opening up the stage play 's single set , Oscar 's living room , by moving the action into the bedrooms and kitchen and giving the mounting tension between Oscar and Felix more corners to bounce off of . Neal Hefti 's familiar score was heard on the TV show , but never so sweepingly orchestrated as it is here , in several different arrangements that make the on - screen action soar whenever its played . Real location work and night shots of Manhattan give the film an energy common to films shot in that place and time ( " Buddwing , " " The World Of Henry Orient , " " Midnight Cowboy , " " Manchurian Candidate , " " Rosemary 's Baby , " etc . ) Are Lemmon and Matthau too heavy in comparison to Tony Randall and Jack Klugman ? To be fair , the movie is meant to be a more serious affair , dealing with the then - uncommon condition of mid - life divorce and the frustration inherent in not being able to make a relationship work . Simon has more in mind than entering Felix and Oscar in a game of " Password " or a battle of wits with Howard Cosell . But I do n't know ... Both Lemmon and Matthau were terrific comedians I enjoy watching especially in the middle of this film as I often do in their separate movies , but I never understood why they were regarded as a great comedy team . Here , in their best - regarded partnership , they seem to be acting in two different films ; Lemmon in a comedy - drama and Matthau in a farce . Matthau is great in the beginning , charming us with his teddy - bear demeanor around the poker table , but near the end of the film he takes a turn much like Jack Torrance 's in " The Shining , " reacting to Felix cleaning up his apartment and serving tasty food to his friends in a way that totally upsets the delicate balance of blame . While the ending bothers me , the part many see as the most jarring , the beginning , works fine as I see it . Watching Felix stumbling around trying to kill himself is n't great comedy , no , but it 's a good way to get into a great comedy , setting us up with some real - life pain before bringing in the warmth and laughter . ( Plus it has some great shots of the seedier parts of the city . ) In the middle of the movie , this scene would have been a miscalculation , but it works as a way of establishing Felix 's torment and a sense of sharp relief to come when we see Oscar and his poker friends bicker and feud . That 's where Simon 's lines are so great . They are the underlying strength of the film . He gets the banter exactly right and real , and still makes it funny . " I do n't mind you talking , Felix . You got things to say . What 's scaring me is I 'm beginning to listen . " The TV show showed how wrong it is to assume the movie is always better , in fact the TV show once made a good point about " assuming " anything at all , but the movie makes for a solid foundation and is a joy in its own right .
neg	This was a watershed event in my movie watching life . I went to see this in the theater when it came out . I was completely amazed at just how bad it was . Movies like this make you wonder who put the money up and who owed whom a favor - a very , very large favor . The special effects are absolutely first grade level , as in any first grader could have done them . Toy rubber bats on strings with no attempt to hide the strings , arrows that appear to be drawn on the film and look to be the shape of an arrow you 'd find on a street sign , and a laughable story line . Ed Wood made masterpieces compared to " Conquest " . Every film student should see this thing just so they 'll know the very definition of a bad movie .
pos	I watched The Babysitter as part of BCI Eclipse ' Drive - in Cult Classics ( featuring Crown International Pictures releases ) on DVD . I think it is a very good film . This movie packs a lot of story into a very short time . You have hippies , rock music , bikers , lesbians , sexual impropriety , blackmail , and murder , all in one spot !   The lead actors do a credible job . And , I found the intricately woven plot to be believable and interesting . However , the supporting cast , primarily the bikers , delivers a stilted performance , particularly when asked to deliver lines with more than just a few words . Perhaps they used real bikers , instead of actors . A couple of the characters , in particular , were exceptionally believable . The musical score is absolutely spot - on , for the times , the tempo , and for moving the story forward . I found the music a real treat . I noticed in the opening credits that the movie featured the music of " The Food , " I googled them ; but , could n't find anything ... In any case , George E. Carey who wrote , produced and starred in this movie liked the idea so much ( of a wayward married man brought to redemption through trials and tribulation ; and , a little help - of course ) that he wrote , produced and starred in " Weekend with the Babysitter . "
neg	Del - " You are the dumbest smart person I 've ever met . " Calvin- " Well , I had a brain , but they lost it in the re - writes . " I think what I find most egregious about this bastardization of Asimov 's work was how the character of Susan Calvin was portrayed . In the books , she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists , able to think her way through a problem . Here she 's just a damsel in distress , waiting to be rescued by Wil Smith . There are passing references to Asimov 's Laws of Robotics , but they are an afterthought to the CGI and action scenes . Smith is likable , as he is in most of his films , but honestly , the story is n't that good . YOu figure it out long before these genius characters do .
pos	An excellent movie about two cops loving the same woman . One of the cop ( Périer ) killed her , but all the evidences seems to incriminate the other ( Montand ) . The unlucky Montand does nt know who is the other lover that could have killed her , and Périer does nt know either that Montand had an affair with the girl . Montand must absolutely find the killer ... and what a great ending ! Highly recommended .
neg	Wow ... where to begin ... picked this up at Big Lots for only $ 2.99 . That 's three bucks I 'll never see again ... ever ... and for what ? I 'll tell ya . An hour and fifteen minutes of boring , boring , boring chat and college angst that seemed more suitable for a Lifetime movie than the horror flick advertised on the box . ( May the marketing droids who designed it burn in Hell for all eternity ) . Follow that up with a little bit of cheap gore ( not even good gore mind you ... ) and a plot twist at the end that comes out of nowhere , and makes no sense . Awful , awful , awful ... Was there any redeeming qualities ? Well , on the Joe Bob Briggs scale , there WERE six breasts involved , but that 's hardly worth my long lost three bucks . Without those , this coulda been on Sci - Fi at , say , two or three in the morning ... Bmoviefreak
pos	I read a small ad in some horror magazine in the early nineties about Liebe des Totes ( the love of the dead ) or something similar . This of course awoke my curiosity so I ordered Nekromantik 1 & 2 and Der Todesking ( The Death King ) . The Nekromantik movies are Ok , even kind of interesting and unique in their approach to the subject Necrophilia ( even if they obviously are horror - opera entries rather than intended to invoke fear in the viewers mind , they are actually quite funny . ) TODESKING , on the other hand is , in my opinion , one of the best films ever made . It consist of a series of scenes depicting the many facets of death . Death as an enemy ; Death as a reliever , Death as the very fysical decomposition of the body . The film is a metaphor over life . It shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are . It reduces its viewers to the childs they ( we ) actually are . The fact that we can not really understand the nature of Death , and hence neither the process of dying , is the core message of the film . This is a most realistic film . Never does Buttgereit try to hide death behind white roses or whatever . No matter what moral standards you set up , death is unevitable , and will sooner or later be not a fiction but YOUR reality . This applies to YOU , Dear Reader , like it applies to the viewers of the film . Some juvenile reviewers seem not to grasp this , which is fully excused , since they of course will live forever ... This is no exploitation movie . Why ? Because death does not exploit us humans . It harvests us . We grow for seven days , then we are brought back to the schopenhauerian state of pre - birth , that is Death . Buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest of tales . Whether you choose to regard it as " optimistic " or " pessimistic " is up to you . At first glance it may seem very dark . Consider though , that in order for something to live , something else must die . " Who wants to live forever ? " I believe that when Buttgereit shows a body , that are being consumed by maggots , he shows not only decomposition , but GENERATION of new life . Is it not better to die and give life to maggots and then birds and eventually become soil , than to remain the living dead zombie that is one of the the favorite pets of the genre ? When you realize this , you see Der Todesking it its right context . Sieben Tage hat die Woche , siebenmal letzte Stunden . Seven are the days of week ( weak , mortal ! ) , seven times the last hour . Do nt fear the Reaper , Buttgereit tells us , because the Reaper takes only what is ripe . And apples that are not plucked for food will rot ! Have a good life , fellow IMDB'ers ! ( And watch this film , that compares only to Ingemar Bergmans " The Seventh Seal " in terms of depth and universality )
neg	awful , just awful ! my old room mate used to watch this junk and it drove me crazy . the book is one of my favorites and its a shame that some people will never know what it is really like because their first impressions are from dribble like this . they changed so much it is hardly recognisable . which baffles me since the book reads like a soap opera anyway , providing enough fodder for modern day entertainment . it 's like one of those Lifetime movies that say " based on a true story " but are completely fictional . there is none of the emotion or depth of the book , just mindless melodrama . if you are a high school student looking for a way to get out of reading , i suggest you try another version .
pos	Sinnui yauman , is without a doubt one of the best ghost stories ever made into film . Written by Songling Pu and directed by Siu - Tung Ching , A Chinese Ghost Story has it all . Ling Choi Sin played by Leslie Cheung is a young man down on his luck who goes in search of a monastery for lodging , deep in the woods , a place the villagers seem very afraid to go near . The trek alone is perilous with wolves , and a crazy taoist monk lives at the temple . Ling Choi Sin meets Tsing , a beautiful and mysterious young girl who also lives nearby in a deserted temple . She is forced to seduce men for her evil mistress , but when she meets innocent Ling Choi Sin they fall in love . Ling Choi Sin is sort of a bumbling fool but his heart is in the right place , while Tsing tries to protect him from the other spirits in the woods , he tries to protect her from the monk who is trying to kill the spirits in the woods . There 's great martial arts , even a monk that breaks out into drunken song as he performs ritual taoist sword forms . The movie does a lot of traditional old martial art films acrobatics , with magic and flying through the air , leaping from tree to tree , with elegant long gowns and scarves , but the movie genuinely flows , and everything is effective . Tsing is to be married to a evil tree monster , which ca nt be good , and we feel her plight in her home where we meet her sisters and stepmother who is truly not nice . In the end they must fight a tree witch with a deadly tongue , and go with Yin deep into the heart of hell to fight a thousand year old evil to save their souls , and bring Ling 's ashes back to her home for a proper burial so she may have a chance at reincarnation . A beautiful story that truly pays attention to details . One is touched in many ways by this movie , you 'll laugh , cry , and just have fun with the great martial arts and cinematography . And though at the end , Yin and Ling Choi Sin ride off into the morning sun under a enchanting rainbow , we never know if Tsing was afforded a reincarnation , but we do know her
neg	the intention the directors has for this films are quite honorable , but his history of his productions did get me aware that this might not get much to the core like other film makers would do it . keeping his great 30 days TV series in mind but also counting in his MTV production " i bet you will " that opposes his seriousness in any of the matters he documents and also counting in his rather disappointing production " supersize me " i did not had my hopes up high . sadly enough this movie disappointed me none the less . as with " supersize me " after a while i did ask myself what exactly the point of all this was . the main statement gets clear enough after half an hour but the rest of the playtime gets filled with rather pointless stuff and re - repeating stuff that were already shown in this way or another earlier in the movie , so it wears out and gets extremely boring towards the end .
pos	Along with South Pacific , Guys and Dolls is for grown - ups - - it is sassy , sexy , and full of men being men and women being strung along . There is an energy and drive that makes this stand out from the pack - the strength of Jean Simmond 's performance , and the charm of a young Brando , and an already masterful Sinatra add much to the overall feel and look of the piece . Guys and Dolls wins as it is unashamedly what it is : an MGM musical . Still good to look at and listen too with great tunes and dance numbers - it will remain one of the classics of 20th Century cinema and be watched with pleasure for years to come . Warmly recommended .
neg	I understand what this movie was trying to portray . How the old are often ignored and treated like a bother , which means they end up feeling unappreciated and like their lives are empty . I do not have a problem with this message , but I just feel that it could have been put across in a way that is not so painful to watch . I enjoy a good art movie but when a movie becomes too self - consciously arty ( as in this case ) the result is often frustrating . Including shots of a person packing a suitcase slowly that take 5 minutes try to make a point but just end up annoying the audience . The female characters are very weak and you end up wanting to just tell them to pull it together . This is a movie you feel you should enjoy or rate highly and certainly has its ' merits but I was just too frustrated watching it to ever recommend it to someone else . It might have a deeper message than other Roger Michell movies ( for example : ' Notting Hill ' ) but at least that was a movie you could enjoy watching .
pos	I saw this movie on the BIFFF Festival in Brussel , spring 2004 . What a surprise ! This German production , a stylish and imaginative shocker , is one of the scariest flic i have seen . Be warned : this is not a joke ! This terrorizer has a big cast of good actors ( as an example : Peter Martell as a European guru has a strong presence ) , excellent direction , nice production design , a very good soundtrack and a lot of heavy gore sfx like Italian horror movies in the eighties . Flesh ripped clean to the bone ... and the blood runs red ... this savage Heart Stopper will grip you ... and give you some dark dreams ... A must - see ! !
neg	Imagine that in adapting a James Bond novel into a movie , the filmmakers eliminated all the action and suspense in order to make it kid - friendly . Or if a television producer told Chris Rock he could n't cuss so that his specials could be rated PG . In the same way , the director of the movie " Something Wicked This Way Comes " took out the excitement and gore in favor of melodrama for younger audiences . This created a monotonous plot without the complications of the book . In trying to make the story of " Something Wicked This Way Comes " easier for children to follow , the filmmakers eliminated the theme of good and evil both existing in everyone , and good always prevailing over evil . This is apparent in Will 's character transformation , Charles Halloway 's rescue of Jim , and the carnival 's defeat . Will 's transformation into a more adventurous boy has been muted in the movie . The scene in which the Dust Witch visits Will 's house in a balloon has been cut from the film . Instead , a green mist follows Jim and Will home and gives them the same bad dream about the Witch and her spiders . The balloon attack shows us that Will has begun to conquer his fear of doing things on his own . He gets on top of a neighbor 's roof and tears the balloon with a bow , defeating the Witch . " Sorry , Dad , he thought , and sat up , smiling . This time it 's me out , alone , " Will decides as he prepares to face her ( 147 . ) Removing this scene from the movie prevents us from understanding that Will is becoming more adventuresome . The film shows us many examples of Will being afraid to follow Jim , but never growing curious like his friend . In the book , Will has both a good , quiet side and an " evil , " daring side like his Jim . In the movie , each boy only has one mode of thought , which destroys Bradbury 's theme of both good and evil being present in each person . In the book , Will saves Jim because of their friendship , but , in the movie , Charles Halloway saves Jim to repay Jim 's father . Will pulls Jim off the carousel in Bradbury 's novel because he does n't want his best friend to grow up without him . It is the good in Will , the fact that he cares about his friend , that saves Jim from the evil curse of the carnival . On the carousel , Jim " gestured his other hand free to trail on the wind , the one part of him , the small , white , separate part that still remembered their friendship " ( 269 . ) This shows that there was good left inside of Jim , which has the potential to still defeat evil . But when Charles Halloway saves Jim in the movie , he does it to repay the debt he owes Jim 's father , who saved Will when he was a little boy . By changing the motivation for saving Jim , the filmmakers have ruined Bradbury 's original idea that it takes good to win against evil . In the end of the movie , the carnival is defeated by a tornado and lightning instead of smiles and laughter . When the book ends , Mr. Dark turns himself into a little boy and Charles Halloway smiles and laughs at him so much that he ca n't stand it and evaporates . In Bradbury 's world , evil people feed off fear and can only be defeated by happiness and love . His message is that good will always prevail over evil , but only if that goodness is expressed outwardly . " Good to evil seems evil , " says Charles Halloway as he holds the dying Mr. Dark . " So I will do only good to you , Jed . I 'll simply hold you and watch you poison yourself " ( 275 . ) In the movie , Mr. Dark is the only one left on the carousel when lightning hits it , and he dies . By eliminating the weapon of laughter and smiles , the filmmakers imply that bad weather is the most effective way to defeat evil , as if lightning only strikes those who are bad . This takes away the major theme of Bradbury 's book , which is that doing " good " toward others wards off evil . Good may always triumph over evil , but trying to make movies more kid - friendly will always force filmmakers to leave out some of the themes from the books they are based on . In the movie , " Something Wicked This Way Comes , " Will does not transform , Will 's friendship does not save Jim , and smiles and laughter do not defeat the carnival . As a result , the filmmakers have left out too many of Bradbury 's main points . The process of adapting a book to a movie too often ruins the world the author has established . In the case of this story , Bradbury 's frightening world of opposing forces of good and evil has been reduced to a tamer , simpler version of itself .
pos	" Spin it ! " The 90s opened up with a clever Disney favorite , " TaleSpin , " the TV cartoon series that featured characters from " The Jungle Book . " Join Baloo and Kit Cloudkicker as they fly the Sea Duck like you 've never seen it before : out of Cape Suzette , to Louie 's , up mountains , through jungles , on water , in volcanoes , looking for adventure , looking for treasure , looking for fun , all in one action - packed cartoon adventure ! ! ! ! ! This was a favorite of mine as well as my family 's . This ran on The Disney Afternoon the entire first half of the 90s until the original cartoons moved to the Old Disney Channel in 1995 , which I have seen on vacation once in 1996 before getting cable in March 1997 .

neg	This rubbish excuse for television is the single most god - awful piece of trash ever to hit Australian television . The house - mates are dull , uninteresting , ridiculously unintelligent and are picked on the basis that you would be likely to attempt to murder them if you had to live with them . As far as I am concerned Big Brother is the decline of western society , showing how us as a society are on a steep slope to becoming brain - dead morons . Whatever happened to television that did n't target the lowest common denominator of society as an audience ? This can not be classified as entertainment . I think that it true that Channel Ten can remove your soul . It happened to Rove McManus who was once a respectable comedian and , once moving to Channel 10 , become horribly unfunny . With the exception of The Simpsons which is highly intelligently made .
pos	Loosely based on the James J Corbett biography " The Roar Of The Crowd " , Gentleman Jim is a wonderfully breezy picture that perfectly encapsulates not only the rise of the pugilistic prancer that was Corbett , but also the wind of change as regards the sport of boxing circa the 1890s . The story follows Corbett { a perfectly casted Errol Flynn } from his humble beginnings as a bank teller in San Fransico , thru to a chance fight with an ex boxing champion that eventually leads to him fighting the fearsome heavyweight champion of the world , John L Sullivan { beefcake personified delightfully by Ward Bond}. Not all the fights are in the ring tho , and it 's all the spin off vignettes in Corbett 's life that makes this a grand entertaining picture . There are class issues to overcome here { perfectly played out as fellow club members pay to have him knocked down a peg or two } , and Corbett has to not only fight to get respect from his so called peers , but he must also overcome his ego as it grows as briskly as his reputation does . Along with the quite wonderful Corbett family , and all their stoic humorous support , Corbett 's journey is as enthralling as it is joyous , yet as brash and as bold as he is , he is a very likable character , and it 's a character that befits the tagged moniker he got of Gentleman Jim . The film never sags for one moment , and it 's a testament to director Raoul Walsh that although we are eagerly awaiting the final fight , the outer ring goings on are keeping us firmly entertained , not even the love interest sub plot hurts this picture { thank you Alexis Smith}. The fight sequences stand up really well , and they perfectly show just how Corbett became the champ he was , his brand of dancing rings round slugger fighters is now firmly placed in boxing history . As the final reel rolls we all come down to earth as an after fight meeting between Sullivan and Corbett puts all the brutality into context , and it 's here where humility and humbleness becomes the outright winner , and as far as this viewer goes .............. it will do for me to be sure to be sure , 9/10 for a truly wonderful picture .
neg	I could n't believe my eyes when I watched Nuremberg yesterday on Dutch television . It starts very slowly , the backgrounds of the Nuremberg trials become clear step by step , the Germans have a funny English accent , but then , suddenly , in the last few minutes of the first part of the series , the audience gets to see the most shocking , horrific footage I have ever seen . It is important that people get to see such footage ( although I absolutely do n't agree with people stating that there is no minimum age at which children can be exposed to this kind of material ) , but in this film it was completely ridiculous . It was purely meant to improve the impact of an ordinary TV series . It was meant to shock the audience which is very cheap and unbelievably easy . In stead of trying to move us with well - done scenes , inspiring dialogue or interesting viewpoint 's , the audience is being tortured with horrible images of skin - and - bones camp inmates . It does n't show any respect for the victims of the holocaust . I 'm very angry .
pos	Indian Directors have it tough , They have to compete with movies like " Laggan " where 11 henpecked , Castrated males defend their village and half of them are certifiable idiots . " Devdas " , a hapless , fedar- festooned foreign return drinking to oblivion , with characters running in endless corridors oblivious to any one 's feelings or sentiments - alas they live in an ornate squalor of red tapestry and pageantry . But to make a good movie , you have to tight - rope walk to appease the frontbenchers who are the quentessential gapers who are mesmerized with Split skirts and Dishum - Dishum fights preferably involving a nitwit " Bollywood " leading actor who is marginally handsome . So you can connect with a director who wants to tell a tale of Leonine village head who in own words " defending his Village " this is considered a violent movie or too masculine for a male audience . There are very few actors who can convey the anger and pathos like Nana Patekar ( Narasimhan ) . Nana Patekar lets you in his courtyard and watch him beret and mock the Politician when his loyal admirers burst in laughter with every word of satire thrown at him , meanwhile his daughter is bathing his Grandson . This is as authentic a scene you can get in rural India . Nana Patekar is the essential actor who belongs to the old school of acting which is a disappearing breed in Hindi Films . The violence depicted is an intricate part of storytelling with Song&Dances thrown in for the gawkers without whom movies wo n't sell , a sad but true state of affairs . Faster this changes better for " Bollywood " . All said and done this is one good Movie .
neg	Falsely accused , skirt - chasing chums John Wayne ( as John Scott ) and Eddy Chandler ( as Kansas Charlie ) change identities to become " Alias Smith and Jones " . Mr. Wayne becomes " John Jones " . Mr. Chandler 's is supposed to be " Rev. Smith " , but Wayne calls him " Dr. Smith " . At no time are either of them as entertaining as Roger Davis , Pete Duel , Jonathan Harris , or Ben Murphy ; although , Wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them , career wise . Pretty blonde Mary Kornman ( as Anne ) , grown - up from her days in " Our Gang " , is a lovely interest for Wayne . She and Chandler have a couple of cute scenes with Wayne . If you 're not a fan of low budget John Wayne films of the 1930s , this movie wo n't make you one .
pos	In this Muppet movie , Kermit , Miss Piggy , Fozzie , Gonzo , Rowlf , Scooter , Camillia , Dr. Teeth , Floyd , Animal , Janice , and Zoot are college graduates who decide to bring their successful college musical , Manhattan Melodies , to Broadway . Unfortunately , no producer will even meet with the Muppets . After being denied by too many producers , Scooter suggests that the Muppets decide to move on on their own . However , Kermit still believes that he can get his show on Broadway , but after he finally does and let 's everybody know that he sold the show , Kermit get 's amnesia and the others do n't know where he is . This features many great scenes , including a live action sequence that introduced the Muppet Babies , a wedding sequence filled with Muppets , including the Sesame Street cast and Traveling Matt ( from Fraggle Rock ) , Scooter as a movie theatre usher , and a scene where Rizzo and the other rats cook breakfast . My only complaint is that more characters were n't included more . Sure , many of them appear at the wedding , but there should have been some significant roles for Bunsen , Beaker , Beauregard , and Sweetums , and Lips should have been part of The Electric Mayhem in this movie like he was in The Muppet Show 's last season and The Great Muppet Caper , and Miss Piggys dog Foo Foo should have been with her as well ( after all , Rizzo The Rat , also performed by Steve Whitmire , had a big part in this movie , and he was n't very well - known at the time ) .
neg	I hated this movie . It was absolutely horrible , poor , poor , PITIFUL acting , REAL REAL REAL stupid criminals that were n't even the LEAST BIT funny(unlike the first 2 home alone movies that were very good ) . all the boobie traps are weak , pathetic excuses for ideas poorly copied of of the first two which just meant that the people writing this movie were just lazy because their paycheck did n't go above 20 bucks a week . This movie is absolutely lousy , it 's not worth even renting . In fact do n't even watch it on t.v . ! Go use your eyes in a more useful way by seeing the first two ! I BARELY give this 1 star(out of 10 ) . Just trust me when I say , if you liked the first two , and you are not a complete stupid person , you will not like this movie , do not watch this movie ! ! !
pos	I was watching this movie at one of my usual time , which is real real late at night . Usually if a movie does n't interest me , I start falling asleep and have to raid the fridge to stay awake . At first I thought that 's what I had to do since this movie 's pacing started off slow , along with the fact that its shots tended to linger with the character for a long time . But after a bit , I start getting more into the movie , as more is revealed about the main character through his story telling . By the end , you feel like you 've known him your whole life . The movie kept my interest so much that I did n't even know the sun was about to rise . Not much of Lynch 's bizzare style , but there is enough of quirky characters to make the film amusing .
neg	Bo Derek might have had a career had she not let her late husband , John , take over as her director . It 's a real shame , no really , with the right direction and the right part ( see " 10 " ) , Bo was okay . She would n't win any awards even at her best , but she is no worse than many an actress who has made it big in the past 15 years or so based on looks alone . But therein lay the problem , John was determined to ride the wave that Bo created with her appearance in 10 , that of Bo being the " perfect 10 , " " the hottest woman in America , " " the sex symbol of the 1980s . " Problem is , in John 's hands , this wave crashed with a resounding thud in only a few year 's time . Maybe he knew her limitations as an actress , perhaps that is why he fashioned movies for her that concentrated on her body , not her acting skills . But it got old real quick . It did n't help matters any that the films of John and Bo Derek are ( let 's be honest ) really , really bad . And bad sums up their take on Edgar Rice Burrough 's literary icon , the Lord of the Jungle , Tarzan of the Apes . You know what 's worst ? This film is boring ! Make me laugh , make me cry , just do n't bore me . Not even Bo 's stunning looks and figure can rouse any interest , and that is what the film is of course built around . Richard Harris ( God bless his soul , he and Bo were previously in Orca btw ) hams it up and makes his scenes at least a little interesting and Miles O'Keefe makes a physically impressive Tarzan . Maybe he got the last laugh , after being hit with a ton of venom from the critics over this film , Miles went on to a solid career as a B movie icon , in films that were not great art , but a million times more fun than this one . But other than that , it 's Bo 's body , and you can only see it so many times before you long for something else to go with it . Tarzan the Ape Man has nothing else . John Derek was a truly dynamic actor , he was not a director . He should have stayed with his strength . This film unfolds at a mind numbingly slow pace and nothing really happens in the action scenes . Burrough 's Tarzan was all about excitement and wish fulfillment ( who would n't want to be as agile , strong and good looking as Lord Greystoke ? ) and fun ! You get none of that here . Watch it , and you will have wasted 107 minutes of your life . On second thought , you may come away with a valuable lesson , how not to handle someone 's movie career .   Bo Derek is all right in my book though . She stood by John until his dying day , has a true love of animals and nature and even looks back with a giggle at her time in the spotlight . She has also proven that she is not the dumb blonde many want her to make her out to be . If she could survive Tarzan and Bolero , she can survive anything . So come back Bo , all is forgiven . And as an aside , is the Steve Strong who plays the bad guy the same Steve Strong who a brief pro wrestling career ?
pos	The most hillarious and funny Brooks movie I ever seen . I can watch and re - watch the tape 100 times . I laugh my a * * off and I cry on some moments . It is really good and funny movie , and if you like Brooks - this is a must ! In short - Brooks ( billionare ) gets to the streets as homeless for 30 days in order to win the entire poor district from his competitor . The reality bites , but in the end - it is about warm relations between humans ... Hightly recommend !
neg	Just kidding ! This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen ! It was so bad though , that it was hilarious . My friend and I purposly rented it because it looked so bad . Cheesy old horror flicks are always good for some laughs . The plot stunk , some of the voices were dubbed , the quality was horrendous . But I sure had a blast watching it !
pos	I have to say despite it 's reviews Angels in the Outfield was a pretty good movie . I like the fact how it teaches kids to always have faith and never give up because yes miracles can happen . Unlike the other baseball movies this one particular movie stood out because of hits amazing special effects and well orchestrated soundtrack which was very interesting . Though I liked this movie it did have some flaws such as some irrelevancy ( i.e. Towards the end when Ray Mitchell hits a homer he does n't step on the plate and therefore that would n't be a score . But that 's just nitpicking . ) I have to say i was really impressed with this movie 's presence and moral : Just have faith , Do n't give up .
neg	I realize that living in the Western Plains of Wyoming during the 1900s was brutal , in fact , it probably is still brutal today , but was it monumental enough to transform into a seemingly " made - for - TV " movie ? Also , women 's rights were still budding in this nation during this time , so to find an independent woman determined to start fresh in this harsh territory , and still show the realism of the era   would it make for good viewing ? Honestly , I do n't know . I have thought about this film for the past two days , and I still ca n't seem to muster the strength to say that it was a horrible film , yet I can truthfully tell you that it was n't the greatest I have ever seen . From several hodgepodge styles of acting , to two mismatched actors playing devoid of emotion character , to some of the most gruesome PG rated scenes to ever come out of late 70s cinema , it is hard to fully get a good grasp on Heartland . Was it good ? Was it bad ? That may be up for you to view and decide yourself , but until then , here are moments I enjoyed and desperately hated !   This film continues to be a struggle in my mind because there were some very interesting scenes . Scenes where I was n't sure what the director was doing or which direction he was headed , but somehow still seemed to work well as a whole . I thought the story as a whole was a very interesting , historical tale . I do not know much about living in Wyoming , especially during the early 1900s , so this film captured that image in my mind . The thought of very cold winters , no neighbors for miles upon miles , and this Polaroid - esquire view untouched by corporate America . It was refreshing to witness and sheer breathtaking to experience ( though the television ) . There were scenes that really stood out in my mind , like the cattle - branding scene , the pig slaughtering scene , and the saddening homesteader that did n't survive their journey , that just brought a true sense of realism to this story . Director Richard Pearce did a great job of bringing the view of Wyoming to the viewers , but I am not sure he brought decent players to accompany the view . While I will constantly compliment the scenery of this film , I had trouble coping with the actors that seemingly walked on the set and read their lines from cards on the side . Rip Torn seemed out of place in his role as Clyde Stewart , a loner that somehow finds a connection with Conchata Ferrell 's Elinore Randall . The two as actors have no chemistry at all . Their scenes that they share together are pointless and honestly void of any emotion . The pregnancy scene nearly had me in stitches because of the way these two " veteran " actors portrayed it . The brave Elinore does what she has to do to get the child out of her , while Clyde gives an approving nod when she is done . This is love ? Was it supposed to be love ? I do n't know , I think with stronger characters we would have seen a stronger bond , but with Torn and Ferrell , it felt like two actors just playing their parts . Other scenes that just seemed to struggle in my mind were ones like when the frozen horse " knocks " on the door for food or shelter , the constantly fading and growing compassion that Clyde had for Elinore 's daughter ( I just did n't believe it ) , the lack of true winter struggle , and the entire land scene . The land scene especially because I needed more explanation on what Elinore was doing , why she was doing it , and why Clyde would build her a house if they were married ! It was these simple events that if taken the time to explore , would have made for a stronger film . Overall , I will go middle of the road with this feature . There were definitely elements that should have been explored deeper , such as the relationship between these two strangers and the ultimate homesteading goals of Elinore , but they were countered with some beautiful scenes of our nation . These panoramic scenes which , in the span of 100 years , have changes from vast mountains to enormous skyscrapers . While there were some brilliant scenes of realism ( starring cattle and pigs ) , I just felt as if we needed more . Depth was a key element lacking in this film , which was overshadowed by marginal acting and a diminishing story . Pearce could have dove deeper into this untapped world , but instead left open loopholes and clichéd Western characters . Ferrell carried her own , but Torn was completely miscast . Decent for a viewing , but will not be picked up again by me . Grade : * * out of * * * * *
pos	I can not comment on this film without discussing its significance to me personally . As a child bad health prevented me from ever going to a cinema . I first encountered movies at the end of WWII through Roger Manvilles splendid Penguin book " Film " , which brought me so much pleasure as my health began to improve that I wish I could buy another copy to re - read today . My introduction to many classics films such as The Battleship Potemkin , Drifters ( Grierson 's magnificent documentary ) , Metropolis , The Cabinet of Dr Caligari , and Ecstasy ; came first through this book and later at my University Art - house cinema . Ecstasy had incurred the wrath of the Vatican , for condoning Eva 's desertion of Emil , her subsequent divorce , and the brief swim she took in the buff , but Roger Manville ignored these trivial matters and discussed the film as a triumphant , outstandingly beautiful , visual paean to love - a view echoed by many IMDb users . A very lonely young man , when I saw it , I willingly concurred . No further opportunity to see Ecstasy arose until the introduction of home videos - by then it had become a treasured memory not to be disturbed . Quite recently I finally added Ecstasy to my home video collection and found this assessment very superficial . Ecstasy is much more of a parable on the continuity of human existence , against which individual lives are insignificant - perhaps a tribute to what Bernard Shaw in his aggressively agnostic writings used to term ' The Lifeforce ' .   Ecstasy portrays a young bride marrying a middle aged man whose sex urge is no longer strong . Disappointed , she returns home and divorces him . Soon after she experiences a strong mutual attraction to a young virile man she meets whilst out horse riding . She makes love for the first time and it is an overwhelming experience . Her former husband can not face rejection and gives the young man a lift in his car intending that a passing train will kill them both on a level crossing . But the train stops in time and the apparently ill driver is taken to recuperate at a nearby hotel where he later commits suicide by shooting himself . After these exciting climacteric sequences , a bland , predictable and almost inevitable ending emphasises that whilst individual human lives exhibit both joy and tragedy , collectively life continues to carry us all forward in its stream and only through contributing to this stream can we be truly happy . This story is trite , the acting is no more than adequate ; and normally such a film would have disappeared into the garbage , as did most of its contemporaries , long ago . What has given Ecstasy its classic status is exceptional cinematography , a continuous lyrical score and very careful loving direction , coupled with something fortuitous but in cinematographic terms very important - it appeared just after the introduction of sound and was probably planned as a silent film . It is sub - titled and its Director has exploited the impact of brief verbal sequences accompanying some sub - titles , and occasionally breaking into the score which so lovingly carries the film forward . This makes it not only almost unique but extremely rewarding to watch . The parable in the tale is stressed continuously but so subtly that only when reflecting after viewing does one become fully aware of it . For example , the names - Eva and Adam ; the obsessive behavior of Emil on his wedding night which shows that triviata have become the most important thing in his life and predicate his eventual suicide since he has no adequate purpose to sustain him ; the ongoing series of beautiful sequences showing erotic imagery ( a bee pollinating a flower , a key entering a lock , a breaking necklace during Eva 's virginal lovemaking sequence with Adam , etc . ) ; and the final post - suicide sequences which could have been filmed in many different ways but serve to extol the importance to individuals of performing some type of work that contributes positively to Society , as well as of creating new life to sustain this society after we ourselves pass on .   As a 1933 film I would rate this at 9 - even comparing it with contemporary works I would not reduce this below 8 . For me the film will always remain a " must see " , ( although you may feel that my background remarks above indicate some bias in this judgment ) . Unfortunately in North America contemporary assessments of this film have been distorted by the extreme 1930 's reaction to Hedy Kiesler 's very brief and relatively unimportant nude scene which she had difficulty living down in Hollywood ( some critics , who have clearly not seen such classic films as Hypocrites , Hula , Back to God 's Country , Bird of Paradise or some of the early works of D.W. Griffiths and C.B. deMille , have even erroneously referred to this as the first appearance of a nude actress in a feature film ) . This scene was probably part of the original novel , and the film would have been very little different if the Director had chosen to rewrite it . Two further thoughts ; firstly this is a Czech film , released there in 1933 . Its final message about hard work generating positive benefits for society must have seemed very superficial to its viewers when a few years later their country became the first victim of Nazi oppression and was virtually destroyed for at least two generations ( I do not remember these sequences being screened just after the war when I first saw this film - were they removed from the copy I saw then ? ) . Secondly for me its main message today is that things of real beauty are often very transitory even though their memory may stay with one for a lifetime . We should all be thankful that today some of them can be captured on camera and viewed again at our convenience .
neg	A spaceship returns from Mars ; about a couple of months earlier , a 4-person expedition had been sent to the red planet . Most of the picture is a flashback to what transpired over there . The picture is saddled by inane , melodramatic dialog , typical of many sci - fi efforts of the fifties & sixties . Note , for example , how the ship 's commander ( Mohr ) tells another crew member to ' stay there ' for no reason ; as if moving to another spot inside the ship will cause a problem . Later , the commander orders two of the crew to remain in the ship while he and another go outside . The two he ordered to stay say ' no way ' and follow out ; I did n't have high hopes for the expedition 's success by this point . There 's much talk of ' ears twitching ' and hugging a freeze - ray gun named ' Cleo ' ( short for Cleopatra , of course ) . It would at least be pretty funny , unintentionally , if the story did n't drag . There 's a very slow pace to the whole thing ; the astronauts spend as much time looking out the ship 's window portals ( which change color from red to blue ) , commenting on what they see , as they do outside actually exploring . The martian landscape , advertised as filmed in ' Cinemagic , ' usually resembles animation cut - outs , or drawings , shot through an orange - red filter to give the illusion of interacting with the actors , who do take on an odd surrealistic appearance due to the process . But I do n't think it fools anyone over 10 years old . The one clever mention I did notice was that the memories of the surviving astronaut would be tinged with unreality , so that would explain the unreal nature of the martian vista . Oh , okay ... I was amused by some of the astronauts ' actions as they begin to explore ; right off the bat , they test their freeze gun on a plant , killing it , just for the hell of it . Then the female member hacks with a machete at what she thinks is a tree but turns out to be the leg of the spider - rat monster . Nice going , lady . Look up next time . No wonder the ' intelligence ' on Mars gets upset and does n't mind that one of the lower lifeforms , a giant amoeba , attacks the explorers . The acting is n't too impressive . Mohr especially , had a very annoying technique , saying a line and then abruptly erupting into a huge grin which always creeped me out - reminded me of It ! the Terror From Beyond Space . The ending is fairly anti - climactic ; do n't expect any huge revelations beyond the ' no more expeditions ' with freeze guns named Cleo .
pos	Answer : despite that fact that this film was written and directed by a woman , your ex is creepier , nastier , and more irrational than any zombie that ever lurched the earth . The acting in this independent film actually is quite good , despite the less - than - wonderful script . It takes a pretty good actor to deliver an overwritten , clichéd line and make it sound vaguely believable . Young Anthony de Marco , as Jake , puts in a particularly good performance . Fortunately , the plot of this film is a lot better than the dialog . Try it , especially if you 're not a monster fan . This is NOT a horror flick . Even though all the adult females are pretty monstrous , and although all the adult males act as if their brains were eaten in some earlier zombie film , " Jake 's Closet " is suitable for mature adults . The whole , this time , is much better than the sum of its parts .
neg	I watched like 8 or 9 Herzog movies and none of them had any impact on me . I watched several documentaries about him . He is obviously an intelligent man , with great knowledge about films and passion for making them , but does this makes him a good director . Definitely NO ! A complete anti - talent . He can make a good documentary because of previously mentioned traits , but a film with actors  never ! He ca n't direct nor write . His screenplays are full of badly thought out situations , and many situations / dialogues in his movies are so childishly and badly done that they can not be hidden behind the word " art " in any sense . No way . Not to mention the unskillful direction , so amateurish - like . To say that he wants to direct like that and write crap like that is a lie . Like the scene when Scheitz gets arrested and Storszek hides in the back of the store . WHO IS HE KIDDING ? He is a cheater ; he knows what fake intellectuals and critics want . He knows what elements he needs to put in the script to get your their attention and empty praising . Never mind the rest of the script and sloppy direction . Just look at Julio Medem . If Herzog can make a movie like Medem can , then I might re - check his old movies and try to find talent in them .
pos	I enjoyed this film . But I was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy . It was amusing at times , but really , it was n't very funny at all . If I 'd been expecting it to be a comedy , I might have been disappointed with the film , but , going in with no expectations , I found it to be enjoyable and engaging . Maybe it was because , as an engineer , I identified with the protagonist . I was less concerned with satire of capital or labor , and more into the basic story of a man fighting for his invention . A man who 's less interested in monetary gain from his invention than he is in seeing it come to fruition and be put into production . He 's absolutely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in return for suppressing his invention . So I find it interesting that people here have compared it to Jurassic Park ; me , I compare it to The Fountainhead .
neg	If this could be rated a 0 , it would be . From the atrocious wooden acting to the dull , plodding pace , the puerile exploitation angle and the sophomoric pseudolesbian titillation added purely for the sake of the sad viewers , this is a disaster of a film . The plot is predictable , as from the beginning one is absolutely certain of what will happen to all of the characters and how the plot will commence . From a boring , unexceptional beginning to a pathetic and bleak ending , every single presence in this film is wasted , and every meagre scrap of talent dug up for this turkey is squandered . If you want to watch something as relentlessly bleak with plenty of the same childish titillation , watch one of the Ilsa films . At least they 're unapologetic and up - front about what they 're trying to do . How something this horrendously bad ever managed to be rated above a 5 is a miracle of how people with no taste or discerning standards can sometimes come together for the most dubious of purposes . It 's not scary , it 's not interesting , and above all it 's not arousing in any sense of the word . It is , in my opinion , a crime ; it is a crime that such a horribly offensive and incompetent piece of trash was ever conceived of and given the resources to come into existence , and even more a tragedy that it is still defended by some woefully misguided viewers . Not even Elvira 's cheerful personality and joking ways could soften the blow that this horrifying travesty of film is . Avoid it at all costs .
pos	This picture in 1935 walked away with all kinds of Ocars for Best Director , John Ford , Actor Victor McLaglen and music by Max Seiner . Victor McLaglen,(Gypo Nolan ) , " Call Out the Marines",'42 , gave an outstanding performance as an Irish rebel who belonged to a rough and tough crowd who were all fighting for a cause and at the same time getting poorer and poorer with plenty of drinking . Gypo Nolan made a bad mistake when he decided to become an informer for his best friend in order to take a trip with his gal to America and a new way of living . Preston Foster , ( Don Gallagher),"Guadalcanal Diary",'43 , gave a great supporting role as the leader of the Irish rebellion and was anxious to capture the informer of his group . Gypo Nolan becomes haunted by his betrayal of his friend and begins to feel just like a Judas . Great film for 1935 and wonderful acting by McLaglen , but rather depressing in every aspect of the film .
neg	This is a classic stinker with a big named cast , mostly seniors who were well past their prime and bedtime in this one . This is quite a depressing film when you think about it . Remain on earth , and you will face illness and eventually your demise . Gwen Verndon showed that she could still dance . Too bad the movie did n't concentrate more on that . Maureen Stapleton , looking haggard , still displayed those steps from " Queen of the Star Dust Ballroom , " so much more down to earth from 10 years earlier . I only hope that this film does n't encourage seniors to commit mass suicide on the level of Jim Jones . How can anyone be idiotic enough to like this and say it gets you to think ? Why did Don Ameche win an Oscar for this nonsense ? If the seniors were doing such a wonderful thing at the end , why was the youngster encouraged to get off the boat ? Why did Steve Guttenberg jump ship as well ? After all , he had found his lady - love .   This would have been a nice film if the seniors had just managed to find their fountain of youth on earth and stay there . Sadly , with the exception of Wilford Brimley , at this writing , Vernon , Gilford , Stapleton , Ameche , Tandy , Cronyn and lord knows who else are all gone . The writers should have taken the screenplay and placed it with this group as well .
pos	I found this to be a charming adaptation , very lively and full of fun . With the exception of a couple of major errors , the cast is wonderful . I have to echo some of the earlier comments -- Chynna Phillips is horribly miscast as a teenager . At 27 , she 's just too old ( and , yes , it DOES show ) , and lacks the singing " chops " for Broadway - style music . Vanessa Williams is a decent - enough singer and , for a non - dancer , she 's adequate . However , she is NOT Latina , and her character definitely is . She 's also very STRIDENT throughout , which gets tiresome . The girls of Sweet Apple 's Conrad Birdie fan club really sparkle -- with special kudos to Brigitta Dau and Chiara Zanni . I also enjoyed Tyne Daly 's performance , though I 'm not generally a fan of her work . Finally , the dancing Shriners are a riot , especially the dorky three in the bar . The movie is suitable for the whole family , and I highly recommend it .
neg	Watching " Kroko " I would have liked to leave the cinema very much for the first time in my life . I would not recommend to watch this movie : flat main characters - absolutely no development e.g. Kroko the metaphoric German problem child remains a pure metaphor without any capability of positive involvement despite several plot - wise chances to do so . Uninspired actors , non - evolving plot . I guess the movie attempted an environmental survey but did not succeed : camera appeared shaky rather than motivated . Pictures were low - contrast , gray and dark - i am sure deliberately but the components did not add up to a convincing impression of the social milieu . The story had certain potential though , it could have made a good short story .
pos	I just recently watched this on the Sundance channel . The idea for the film was to bring many filmmakers , illustrious in their own country , to make short films , eleven of them , all in one film , concentrating on just one subject : September 11 . From wacthing this movie I could tell why these filmmakers were great in their country because it had all elements of a great film . The movie starts off with a film from Iran in which a teacher struggles to teach the students about what had happened with September 11 which they fail to realize until later . The Second Film from France involves a deaf women who writes a letter to her lover angrily while she is unaware of what is going as the T.V plays . The next film from Egypt involves the filmmaker himself talking with a dead soldier about recent events not only about terrorists of 9/11 but bombings in other places . The next comes from Bolivia in which a girl learns about the events of September 11 and believes they must march for them . The next from a country in Africa in which a group of boys follow a man whom they believe to be Bin Ladin . The next comes from Mexico in which nothing is shown but the sounds of that day . The next from Israel involving a reporter at the scene of a bomb trying to get a report but is frequently told about the attacks . There are other films that I ca n't remember at the moment but all of them are powerful . It will bring back your emotions from that day . 10/10
neg	I disagree with much that has been written and said about this supposed " masterpiece " of the German New Wave :   1 ) There are major flaws in simple exposition , in the basic communication of critical plot points , as relating to Maria 's abortion and the secret contract between Oswald and her husband . How many viewers understood that the husband agreed , in exchange for substantial financial remuneration , not to return to and reclaim his wife until Oswald was dead ? 2 ) The ending is highly unsatisfying because arbitrary and accidental . The original screenplay called for Maria to commit suicide after the reading of Oswald 's will , on finding out that her husband had in effect sold their marriage to Oswald . In the final version , however , Maria only runs water from a faucet across her wrist in a gesture of suicide . Maria is then summarily blown up , rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her self - delusion and moral compromise . 3 ) Fassbinder seeks to forcibly superimpose the public on the private , the political on the personal . Contrary to what the critics and " experts " assert , I do n't think it works . Merely intruding historic radio news or the sound of the jackhammers of German reconstruction in the soundtrack on the dramatic events of the movie does not make those historical events integral to the drama .   The selfish ambition of Maria 's rise from poverty to prosperity is meant to parallel the so - called economic miracle of postwar Germany . Maria is thus intended to be a woman specific to and reflective of her time and place , but is in reality unoriginal and nonspecific . Women have been asserting their independence by using sex for self - advancement for ages .   4 ) Lastly , there are several instances of inexcusable sloppiness and amateurishness -- Fassbinder 's drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention have had their effect . Unknown people talk off screen without ever being seen ; music is clumsily intrusive in places ; and melodramatic posturing sporadically substitutes for acting . Strangely , for a movie condemning a country for willful collective amnesia of the holocaust , it itself never mentions it once .
pos	This is a complex documentary that shows many things about early Gay life . To put it in perspective it was when Gay was the word used for the homo - sexual revolution , and not just Gay as a descriptor . Or is it still used that way today ? I believe most of the film comes from circa 1968 to 1989 . It was released in 1993 , so it 's been around . I was touched by the documentaries capturing of one man 's love for another over a 20 some odd year period . A love expressed in ways that only true love can be . There are many scenes of incredible empathy and pain , along with scenes of joy and pleasure . There are scenes of life as a homo - sexual and life as a gay . The film itself was a work of love , and I believe it to be a diamond . At the very least one will get out of this film an understanding of the devastating impact of AIDS . As I write this , I am thinking how much earlier this film seems to me to have been set . The advances in medical , political , and social sciences and culture that have taken place since this film was set ( some 15 years ago ) are amazing . However , obviously , in the case of the disease of AIDS itself , we are not done yet . Heck I guess we are n't done on all fronts . Anyway , it 's just a pretty darn good documentary . I 'd encourage anyone that feels that they do n't quite understand gay life , gay issues , or the devastation of AIDS to watch this film .
neg	When i got this movie free from my job , along with three other similar movies .. I watched then with very low expectations . Now this movie is n't bad per se . You get what you pay for . It is a tale of love , betrayal , lies , sex , scandal , everything you want in a movie . Definitely not a Hollywood blockbuster , but for cheap thrills it is not that bad . I would probably never watch this movie again . In a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time , or you would see it on a Sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time . Despite the bad acting , cliché lines , and sub par camera work . I did n't have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my DVD player . The story has been done many times in many movies . This one is no different , no better , no worse .   Just your average movie .
pos	I remembered this as being one of my favorite books as a child and had been wanting to read it to my 5 year old daughter for a while now . I knew the movie was coming out soon so we went to the library to get the book and they gave us preview passes for the next day ! We rushed home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we could compare . Was n't necessary . The only thing in common between the book and the movie is the main characters ' first name , the fact that there is a bet , and a whole lot of worm eating . Oh yeah , I almost forgot , the kid who cooks most of the worms likes to present his masterpieces with a french accent . How the kids know each other , the number of kids involved , how the bet came about , the number of worms that must be eaten , the time frame in which he has to eat the worms , how they are cooked , progression of friendships , climax scenes , etc . , NOTHING is the same . But somehow , it did not ruin the movie for me . The characters are all enjoyable , and the film did not leave me disappointed . Word of caution for parents , there was one moment when you could hear the adults in the room collectively draw their breath and that was when Billy 's little brother referred to his penis as a " dilly dick " . The embarrassing part came when my daughter proceeded to ask those sitting around us , " Does anybody know what a dilly dick is ? " lol . That and an occasional " shut up " is as foul mouthed as this film gets . My daughter thought she might get sick around worm 3 and 4 ( and was holding the empty nacho container just in case ) but was fine by worm 6 . She and I both really enjoyed the film and had a wonderful time sharing the experience .
neg	I 'm surprised that anyone involved with the production of this series would actually admit responsibility . The script is so unfunny it must have been written by someone who failed the entrance exam for the Canadian Comedy Writers ' Union ( and that 's saying something ! ) . Get out your binoculars if you want , but there 's nothing resembling a joke in sight . Ronnie Corbett must have been flat broke to demean himself with this rubbish . The rest of the cast are so lacking in any kind of acting or comedic ability I 'm amazed it lasted past the first episode - correction , past the auditions . All I can say to those who are amused by it is that they must be very easily entertained . And it 's obvious that the production costs must have been all of ₤100 per episode . And just in case anyone thinks I 'm commenting as a foreigner who is unfamiliar with English humour , I must add that I am indeed English .
pos	Some people say this is the best film that PRC ever released , I 'm not too sure about that since I have a fond place in my heart for some of their mysteries . I will say that this is probably one of the most unique films they , or any other studio , major or minor , ever released . The plot is simple . The ghost of a wrongly executed ferryman has returned to the swamp to kill all those who lynched him as well as all of their off spring . Into this mix comes the granddaughter of one ghosts victims , the current ferryman . She takes over the ferry business as the ghost closes in on the man she loves . Shrouded in dense fog and set primarily on the single swamp set this is more musical poem than regular feature film . Listen to the rhythms of the dialog , especially in the early scenes , their is poetical cadence to them . Likewise there is a similar cadence to the camera work as it travels back and forth across the swamp as if crossing back and forth across the door way between life and death , innocence and guilt . The film reminds me of an opera or oratorio or musical object lesson more than a normal horror film . Its an amazing piece of film making that is probably unique in film history . This is n't to guild the Lilly . This is a low budget horror / mystery that tells you a neat little story that will keep you entertained . Its tale of love and revenge is what matters here , not the poetical film making and it holds you attention first and foremost ( the technical aspects just being window dressing . ) If there is any real flaw its the cheapness of the production . The fog does create a mood but it also hides the fact that this swamp is entirely on dry land . The constant back and forth across it is okay for a while but even after 58 minutes you do wish that we could see something else . Do n't get me wrong I do like the film a great deal . Its a good little film that I some how wish was slightly less poverty stricken . Its definitely worth a look if you can come across it .
neg	Rodney Dangerfield is a great . He has done a lot of great works . But this one .... is awful . The whole plot is whack . It could have been much better . The jokes in the movie are n't funny .... their stupid . This was very not so hilarious . He can do much better than this .
pos	There are so many words I want to use to describe this movie , but ca n't really do that can I ? This movie is a movie to watch if you just want to sit , laugh , cry and then pee . I 'm serious . Do n't watch this movie if you 're easily offended by profanity , sex , nudity , homosexuality ... and everything else associated with nature . Being a woman , and that might not even be a factor , I can watch this movie over and over again . Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely brilliant . Along with all their other debuts , I think Baseketball is the prize winner . I 'm laughing now just thinking about some of the stupid things they do in the movie . Watch the movie ! ! That 's all I 'm going to say . It 's sort of hard for me to leave this comment because I 'm one of those people , like Ozzy Osbourne , who has a curse word in almost every line that blurts out of their mouth when they speak . So I 'm keeping it professional . Best movie . Heck yeah ! !
neg	So it starts with a beautiful old house in the country . You have a group of people who get asked to come to this house and ( not surprisingly ) the caretakers always lock the gates at night for no apparent reason . Anywhoo , the people laugh , joke etc . This Dr tells them a spooky story of this woman and some kids . They get scared , they start to feel stuff . Oh no , a girl see 's s ghost . Some more talking then this huge ghost comes and etc etc . This girl finds out that this ghost killed little kids and that she must free their souls , yeah yeah , blah blah . She does but , oh no , she dies as she does . And goes to heaven whilst this evil ghost goes to hell . Two people survive and escape the house . The script is terrible because a guy gets his head chopped off and Elanor ( the one who dies saving the kids ) says " oh no " . The acting is wooden , the effects are crap and the set is a couple off rooms used over and over again . Basically if you like laughing at badly made films watch it , but if your looking for a scare then definitely give this film a miss . I was extremely disappointed when I watched this . A very big let down . My sister ( who gets sacred very easily ) got bored in this film it is appalling .
pos	The first episode immediately gave a good impression what to expect from the series ! Mysteries waiting to be solved and a lot of good drama ! I love the fact that they gradually reveal the stories concerning the characters ! Explaining just enough to stay excited ! Of course this show has some flaws ! In the first two series there are some characters who for some reason do n't show up in the third season ! Many of the characters have a decent sent off but some of them just are n't there ! Like Rose and her husband ! Where the hell are they ? What happened to them ? Maybe they will return in later episodes ! But it is a little inconsistent ! That being said " Lost " manages to be thrilling every episode(especially the first two seasons ) ! That is a very hard thing to do ! I do notice that in the third season the focus is more on character development than the mystery aspects of the show ! This is not a bad thing ! It even saves some episodes from getting boring ! One of the elements that can be considered the strength of this show are the wonderful characters ! You will grow to love these characters ! Good or bad ! But eventually I will want to see some mysteries to be solved and get closure ! The danger of " Lost " getting canceled due to declining ratings is near ! And that would be devastating !
neg	I hate this movie ! It was NOTHING like the book , and just thinking about it makes me mad . If you watch the movie before reading the book , then yeah , it 's a good movie . But King 's book was AMAZING and this movie was nothing like it . I mean , the general meaning might be sort of similar but most aspects of the movie are completely different . The ending for example ! So in the book it is extremely intense and Danny and Wendy escape seconds before the hotel explodes . but in this horrible movie version jack like takes them through a stupid maze ... yeah , there is no maze in the book and there is no reason for it . Another part that made me angry was that jack just kills Mr. Halloran ! what the heck , he is basically the hero of the book and they just kill him off like he was n't important . Overall , it was just bad that the movie was so extremely off .
pos	Without doubt the best of the novels of John Le Carre , exquisitely transformed into a classic film . Performances by Peter Egan ( Magnus Pym , The Perfect Spy ) , Rudiger Weigang ( Axel , real name Alexander Hampel , Magnus ' Czech Intelligence controller ) , Ray McAnally ( Magnus ' con - man father ) and Alan Howard ( Jack Brotherhood , Magnus ' mentor , believer and British controller ) , together with the rest of the characters , are so perfect and natural , the person responsible for casting them should have been given an award . Even the small parts , such as Major Membury , are performed to perfection . It says a lot for the power of the performances , and the strength of the characters in the novel that , despite the duplicity of Magnus , one can not help but feel closer to Magnus and Axel than to Jack Brotherhood and the slimy Grant Lederer of U.S. Intelligence . I have read the book at least a dozen times , and watched the movie almost as many times , and continue to be mesmerized by both . If I had one book to take on a desert island , A Perfect Spy would be the choice above all others .
neg	All the other comments already said what I was going to say , here goes anyway . I thought this was Italian at first , sorry about that , Italy . I was n't bored because I kept waiting for something to happen . Who did that song about Dr. Tarr and Professor Feather way back when ? Was it Alan Parsons ? Saw this on a Brentwood 10 pack and the quality was as expected , terrible . Full of streaks and stuff . The movie was an incoherent mess . Goofy music and clueless characters . The main guy should have known in the first minute that the doctor was nuttier than the patients . I thought the " doctor " directing the " battle " scene was never going to end . Had some good looking babes though . It seems these dumb ass movies always throw in a naked chick or two and that gets you hooked . I gave it a 2 for the nekkid women . That bird people dance made me want to pull out my own eyeballs . Poe probably did about 3,000 rpms in his grave when this thing came out because it was loosely based on a story of his .
pos	This is a quite slow paced movie , slowly building the story of an ex stripper who begins a new family life with a complete stranger . The viewer slowly feels that there 's something wrong here ... I really loved this movie even though it leaves a slight bitter taste in the end . It is clever , well paced and very well acted . Both Philippe Toretton and Emmannuelle Seigner are deeply into their characters .   The little son " pierrot " is also very touching . A thriller which does not seem like one . A very unconventional movie , very particular atmosphere throughout the whole movie though you might feel awkward a few times with a couple of scenes . i 'll give it a 8/10 ! !
neg	For every series that makes it to television , a 100 ideas are formed , 50 scripts are written , 15 pilots are made , and one , just one , actually makes it to production . From such a selection process , we are lead to believe that the final product must be the cream of the crop , for what other reason could so many ideas be rejected to give us a single television series . And so it goes with True Blood ; all the stars were in alignment and what started as a series of novels was transformed into an idea , a screen play , a pilot , and finally a series . Unfortunately , it can sometimes be a long journey and along the way there are many turns that ultimately change what was good and pure into and show that production people feel would be best for ratings . Oh how wrong they so often are ... True Blood is an example of a creative concept that has developed into one of the poorest story lines , worst acting , and silliest subplots as anything in recent television history . Its international cast of relatively unknown actors struggle to find their voices but keep tripping over their fake southern accents . Alan Ball 's not so secret desires for Ryan ( Jason Stackhouse ) gives us a fresh nude shot each week although it often has nothing to do with the storyline . Tara 's angry black woman characterization fails to connect and you find yourself secretly hoping the vamps take her out quickly before she goes into another speech about white suppression while attend a ceremony for the Glorious Dead of the Confedercy . Sam finds suppressed love for Sookie and suddenly we are to believe he needs to watch over her morning , noon , and night despite years of working with her and avoiding any such relationship . As for Bill the Vampire , his moral high ground is quickly surrendered at the first chance to make love with Sookie and has no issue with make a quick snack of her ( although she remains somewhat unharmed ) . We find the other vampires not so mainstream as Bill but greatly desiring to become accepted by a public as they look at the living as Happy Meals with legs . Despite my best efforts of suffering through the first six episodes , I have come to the realization that no matter how long you watch a bad show , its still bad . Somethings die for a reason , even vampires . Maybe this show should to .
pos	As I watched one of Orson Welles ' last contributions to Hollywood as a filmmaker , I knew I was watching a great movie unfold , though at times I did not know why . The story in The Lady from Shanghai has the prime elements of a film - noir : average - Joe lead , femme fatale , conspicuous supporting characters , and a comprehensible if somewhat convoluted plot structure . It is an entertaining ride , and it 's filled to the brim with Welles ' unique gifts as a director , but there are scenes that tend to just not work , or do n't feel complete in what was Welles ' full vision ( the latter is unfortunately too true- executive producer Harry Cohn and the Columbia execs are to blame for that ) . Welles co - stars with his then wife , the profoundly gorgeous Rita Hayworth , as Mike O'Hara , an Irish worker who can and does get angry at the right people . Hayworth is Mrs. Bannister , married to Mr. Bannister ( Everett Sloane , who played Mr. Bernstein in Citizen Kane ) , who is accompanied by a friend Mr. Grisby ( Glenn Anders , who has great control in his eyes ) . They want to go sailing on their yacht and take O'Hara along for the ride , and at first he 's reluctant , but agrees since he 's falling for the married Mrs. As their journey unfolds , O'Hara finds that Bannister and Grisby are not pleasant to be around , and more so with Grisby , who at first seems out of his gourd . Yet as the plot unfolds , O'Hara is drawn into a scam that Grisby is planning for insurance money , with results that I dare not reveal ( although they have been discussed over and over by others ) . Whatever liabilities pop up here and there in the mystery part of the story ( and those few noticeable moments where shots were studio dictated ) , the performances and the look of the film are what remains striking after over fifty - five years . Though he does n't have the terrific Greg Tolland ( Kane 's DP ) at his side , dependable Charles Lawton Jr. assists Welles in creating an atmosphere that is both elegant and stark , covered in shadows , deep focus , low angles , the works . A particular accomplishment is the fun - house mirror scene , which is merely a highlight among others . Welles himself is always dependable as an actor- even if his accent is n't anything special- and Hayworth herself makes a scene a little more lush , despite her path in the story .   The Lady from Shanghai is worth checking out , especially for Welles , Hayworth , or film - noir buffs ( fans of the Coen brothers might find this fascinating as well ) . It may just take a little while , repeat viewings ( as was for Touch of Evil ) , for the underlying motives in the plot to sink in .
neg	I had some time to kill before watching football so I saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it I thought I had encountered my version of mentally walking the Bataan death march as my conscious was beaten into submission by the awful movie which ripped off the Mummy series and Jurassic Park . It was so bad that I thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup . The acting was so bad that I was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end . The lead by Casper Van Dien made me long for the high caliber acting of Steven Seagal in " On Deadly Ground " as his line reading was so wooden that Woody Woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder . I also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that I was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat . The direction was so abysmal I looked back yearning to my nephew 's grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage . The FX of the movie was so bad that I thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade Z horror flicks from yesteryear . What Robert Wagner , Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie . My warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your IQ to diminish with prolonged viewing . On a side note I noticed at IMDb that sometimes salaries for movies are published I was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies . Beware and be safe avoid at all costs .
pos	By 1987 Hong Kong had given the world such films as Sammo Hung 's ` Encounters of the Spooky Kind ' Chow Yun Fat in John Woo 's iconic ` A Better Tomorrow ' , ` Zu Warriors ' and the classic ` Mr Vampire ' . Jackie Chan was having international success on video , but it was with ` A Chinese Ghost Story ' that HK cinema had its first real crossover theatrical hit in the West for many years . Western filmgoers had never seen anything like it . It was a film that took various ingredients that HK cinema had used for years ( flying swordsman , wildly choreographed martial arts and the supernatural ) and blended them to create a film that was unique in its look , feel and execution . Forget the poor and unnecessary sequels it spawned , this is the original and best . Director Siu - Tung Ching ( still best known as an Action Choreographer on such films as Woo 's ` A Better Tomorrow 2'/'The Killer ' ) has , under the watchful eye of legendary Producer Tsui Hark , created a masterpiece of Fantasy / Horror cinema . And with such an expert crew at his disposal ( no less than 6 Martial Arts Coordinators ) the chances of the film being anything but wonderful would be unthinkable . The editing by the amazingly prolific David Wu ( who wrote / directed ` The Bride With White Hair 2 ' and edited such classic titles as ` A Better Tomorrow 1/2/3 ' , ` Hardboiled ' and the cult hit ` The Club ' ) is quite simply a work of genius . His crafting of the perfectly choreographed high flying , tree climbing sword fights makes them some of the best HK cinema has ever created . Fast moving , outlandish but never confusing they are , even today , the pinnacle of their art . The crew of cinematographers have also done miracles . This is a film where every shot is an expertly crafted painting . Where wonderful blue tinged night sequences , shrouded in an ever - present ghostly fog , are the breathtaking platform for our story to unfold . It 's a film where everything is used to weave a dreamlike beauty . Even the silken robes and dresses worn by Hsiao Tsing become living parts of the movie , whether in romantic sequences or battle scenes the ever present silk flows across the screen . Even a simple scene where Hsiao Tsing changes robes is turned into a thing of fluttering beauty as every skill on the set combines to create a most memorable scene from such a simple act . The sets are also amazing , giving an other worldly sense to the forests , and the temple and harshness to the scorched , flag filled wasteland of hell for the amazing finale . The production design by Zhongwen Xi deserves the highest praise . Another major factor to the films success is the music by Romeo Diaz and James Wong . Hong Kong films have given us some fantastic music and songs that have added so much to the success of a sequence , but on ` A Chinese Ghost Story ' the music is , quite simply , vital . From the opening song onwards the music becomes as important as the characters . The score is a perfect mixture of modern and traditional instruments . Drums , bells and guitars pound away over the action sequences to great effect , but it 's in the slower , achingly romantic pieces that it comes into it 's own . Here ; flutes , strings and female choral effects create what are possibly the finest pieces of music heard in an HK film . Add to this the female vocal , stunningly beautiful song that plays over Tsau - shen 's and Hsiao Tsing 's love making , ( nothing is ever seen , but the effect is wonderful . This is lovingly innocent movie romance ) and you have a shining example of the power a film 's music can have . And we of course have the acting talent . Leslie Cheung ( ` A Better Tomorrow 1 & 2 ' and a very popular singer ) is outstanding as the innocent tax collector . His work in the ( thankfully mild ) comic sequences is never over the top and his scenes with Joey Wang are played with just the right amount of passion and innocence . Joey Wang ( who would later be mostly relegated to support roles in films like the Chow Yun Fat / Andy Lau classic " God of Gamblers " ) has never looked more radiant than how she does here . She is the epitome of ethereal beauty . Her portrayal of the tragic Hsiao Tsing is stunning . She shows her characters sadness at what she has become and what she is made to do , but also gives off a subtle eroticism in the scenes where she is luring the men to their gruesome deaths . Veteran actor Wu Ma ( ` Mr . Vampire ' , ` Swordsman ' ) is great fun as the wise , brave , but ever so grumpy , Yen . He treads a fine line between the eccentric and the annoying with practised ease . And what so easily could have been a character that could have harmed the film is actually wonderfully entertaining and memorable . But what about the monsters and beasties ? , I hear you cry . Well they range from the rather crude but fun stop motion / animatronic zombies that inhabit the temple ( resulting in a great running gag with constantly thwarted attempts to munch on the amusingly unsuspecting Tsau - shen ) , to the rather cheesy but surprisingly effective Lord Black . Complete with an arsenal of vicious flying heads , and quite outstanding wire work . Most of which has , to this day , never been topped . But the most outstanding effect and creation is the tree spirit 's killer tongue . We first encounter this thing with an ` Evil Dead ' style rushing camera effect as it powers down its victims throats to deliver a lethal French kiss that turns the victims into zombiefied husks . But later it 's shown in all its crazy glory . It can grow so big and long that it shoots through the forest after prey , rips apart trees , wraps itself around buildings and coils it 's slimy length around people before picking them up and throwing them against tree trunks ! ! It can even split open to reveal a fang filled mouth ! It 's an outrageous idea that given the deeply romantic main plot should n't work . But it does , to fantastic and unforgettable effect . So what all this adds up to is a classic example of Hong Kong movie making . A true team effort that has given us a truly ground breaking movie . It 's a film packed with wit , invention , action , monsters , martial arts , ghosts , fantastic ideas , lush visuals , beautiful music , and most important to it 's enduring charm , one of cinemas most moving romances .
neg	* MANY MANY SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW * This movie was horrible . I am a huge baseball fan so I thought I 'd watch it , and I was very disappointed . It started out okay .. When I saw the bad influence DeNiro had on his young son , I was hoping that he would become a better father throughout the movie or something . Anyways , at the beginning it seemed as if DeNiro was supposed to be the protagonist . He was the only one that believed in Bobby , and he had his adorable son that he was losing custody of , which gave me a reason to feel bad for him . He wanted to help Bobby by talking to Primo , when out of absolutely nowhere he brutally stabs Primo to death ... Not to mention that sketchy reoccurring song " I WANT TO * * * * YOU ! ! ! ! " at random unfitting moments . Later , when DeNiro saves Bobby 's son from drowning , I was hoping that the movie could redeem itself .. He could forgive himself for killing Primo if he saved Bobby 's son . But of course this is far beyond the depth of the movie , because all he cares about is getting CREDIT for the murder , and does so by stealing Bobby 's son , car , and dog and holding them hostage- Bobby just has to hit a home run and announce that DeNiro is a " true fan " while displaying a picture of him biting a knife . Now we get to the completely unrealistic scene at the end ... It is pouring like hell and we are expected to believe that the game has n't been called . Then DeNiro somehow magically appears on the field in an umpire suit and calls Bobby out at home , proceeding to pull out his knife and start stabbing everyone that runs onto the field . There are seemingly no officers on the field ( but the police are on their way ) , so DeNiro steps on the mound and prepares to pitch a knife to Bobby when he gets shot to death . But do n't worry , this cheerful and pleasant movie has a happy ending , because Bobby find his son . This is NOT a sports movie . It is NOT about a fan . As far as I know , fans are not rabid psychopaths that threaten , rob , and throw knives at their admirees . This is likely to be the sickest movie I will ever see in my life . The plot was shallow , the soundtrack sucked , the movie had no purpose whatsoever . I warn you not to waste your time on this disgusting excuse for a film .
pos	This adaptation of M.R. James 's short story ' A View From A Hill ' was first shown on British television in 2005 , on the little watched digital channel BBC 4 . I saw that it was being repeated again on BBC 4 , and decided to give it a go , remembering the BBC 's successful 1970 's adaptations of other M.R. James stories including ' Whistle And I 'll Come To You My Lad ' and ' The Signalman ' . Though not in the same class as these masterpieces , ' A View From A Hill ' is nonetheless an enjoyable and at times suspenseful drama . A historian arrives in a small rural village to look over the collection of a recently deceased collector of antique artifacts . Whilst out in the countryside , he sees an abbey that has been in ruins for hundreds of years . But what does this have in connection with an old pair of binoculars and a gruesome legend about the ominously named Gallows Hill ? And what do the brusque country squire and his servant know about the situation ? Whilst not scary in any way , I enjoyed this little production , and had the running time been longer than 40 minutes it could have become a truly great adaptation . As it is , it all feels a little rushed and a bit more exposition to set the mood would have been welcome . I give it 7 out of 10 .
neg	This is a dry and sterile feature filming on one of most interesting events in WWII and in history of warfare behind the front line . Bad drama composition is worst about this film as plot on killing Hitler suppose to be pretty dramatic event . There is no character development at all and idea that Tom Cruise suppose to play a high rank commander that questions his deepest inner thoughts on patriotism and treason is completely insane . I believe that Mister Bin would play it better . Generally speaking , film pretty much looks as a cheep copy of good German TV movie " Stauffenberg " from 2004 , but ca n't get close to that film regarding any movie aspect whatsoever . However , movie obviously gets its financial goal with pop - corn audience that cherishes Hollywood fast - mood blood and shallow art values .
pos	Other reviewers have summarized this film noir well . I just wanted to add to the " Whew ! " comment one reviewer made regarding Elisha Cook 's obviously coke - fuelled drumming episode . This WAS a doozy , I must say . Cook deserved some acclaim for his frenzied performance . A bit of trivia that I am surmising about : Cook appeared as a waiter in the 1941 Barbara Stanwyck film , " Ball of Fire . " He was a waiter in the nightclub where Barbara was singing and legendary drummer Gene Krupa was drumming , most energetically . Is it too much to suggest that Cook 's spazzy drumming in the later film , " Phantom Lady , " was very much inspired by Krupa 's work , as witnessed by Cook 3 years earlier ?   If you watch Krupa in " Ball of Fire , " I think you 'll note some clearly similar body movements . One hopes , of course , that HE was not influenced by any drugs at the time !
neg	Imagine pulling back the mask of a lethal assassin and finding Barbara Cartland there ... that 's what happens with this film . The opening showed promise , but soon it drops all pretenses of being a thriller ( or even an imaginative love story ) and the only reason they made this story becomes abundantly clear : to fill a gap in their female viewing market by creating yet another re - hash of ' mis - understood , brooding bad - boy ' ( Andrei ) meets ' innocent , whimsical beauty ' ( Paula ) .   Rather than waste any time in creating an original premise , the filmmakers went straight for the money - shot : the bad boy being tamed by said whimsical beauty . Thence follows a string of insincere and heavily - clichéd love scenes sprinkled with pseudo philosophical / poetic fluff . Andrei 's admission of being ( eponymously ) a ' poet ' is levered in to round out the perceived qualities a Byronic hero should have - but even when we 're told in heavy , underlined writing who and what he is , it 's still difficult to believe it - or care . For a Byronic hero / antihero to work , the story needs subtlety , style and innovation - all of which are utterly absent here . This is not a modern day Phantom of the Opera , it 's just what happens when a weak and rather silly woman ( with loose knicker elastic ) dates a bad man , who , after meeting her , seems as dangerous as bunny slippers . The performances might have saved this film , had they been any good : the female lead is preoccupied with looking sexy and ' otherworldly ' , no matter how forced or ridiculous ; and poor Dougray Scott appears to have been drugged as he shambles through his part . This is not his best work . The glimmers of interest were brought by Jürgen Prochnow as ' Vashon ' , and Andrew Lee Potts as the young photographer / brother . A better movie would have offed the sister and kept the brother instead .
pos	A somewhat typical bit of filmmaking from this era . Obviously , It was first conceived into this world for the stage , but nonetheless a very good film from beginning to end . Peter O'Toole and Susannah York get to do their stage performance act for the silver screen and both do it effectively . There is very little in the way of story and anyone not familiar with this type of off beat character study may be a little put off by it . All in all , though , A good film in which Peter O'Toole and Susannah York get to overact .
neg	It is a great tragedy that both Richard Harris and John Derek are no longer with us . But that should n't blind anybody to the fact that in 1981 , a pretty ugly blotch appears on both men 's CVs . No doubt John Derek conceived this movie doing for his wife what ' Some Like it Hot ' and ' One Million Years BC ' did for Maryln Monroe and Raquel Welsh respectively , creating an iconic sex symbol for the new decade . Having run to embrace Dudley Moore on the beach in ' 10 ' Bo 's reputation , an all - star cast and location filming in Sri Lanka meant that nothing could go wrong . Alas , as they say , Mortals plan and God laughs . It is said that when this film premiered in 1981 , the Edgar Rice Burrows estate tried to take legal action against it . Bo Derek plays Jane Parker who sets off into turn - of - the century Africa to be reunited with her boozy , abusive Dad , Richard Harris . Daddy Parker is an explorer who has set out to find ' the Great Inland Sea ' the stuff of local legend , whose existence has been poo - pooed by conventional wisdom . Harris is worth watching for a wonderfully hammy , tanked -up performance which includes singing an Irish ditty at an Indian elephant that somehow found its way into Africa ( did it arrive at the same time as the Orang - Utan from Sumatra ? ? ? ) Furthermore , although Jane professes to despise Parker , Bo and Rich 's relationship is creepily incestuous , testimony perhaps to the effects of the tropical heat . Before long , however , local legends start to circulate about a ' Great White Ape ' and Jane hears the famous yodel . This is the movie 's cue for Miles O'Keefe , a future B - Movie star , making a rather odd debut as the loin - clothed Lord of the Jungle . Unlike Johnny Weismuller with his pidgin English or Ron Ely who speaks the language fluently , the O'Keefe Tarzan is mute . Given some of Bo and Richie 's dialog , though , this is probably not a bad thing . Harris and his caravan eventually reaches the Great Inland Sea , located atop a gigantic plateau that seems to run halfway across Africa .... hang on , are n't seas , lakes and other watery places generally located in low - lying areas ? ? Nevermind , it is just one of many anomalies in the John Derek universe . The crew attempt to mount the cliffs and when the ropes snap , Harris roars echoing abuse at the hapless men who have plummeted to their deaths . On another occasion , Jane decides to take a nude swim by the Inland Sea , giving another occasion to see some gratuitous nudity . Out of nowhere a single male lion appears . Now lions usually travel in prides and never go near beaches but later on , Tarzan will be wrestling with a ( venomous ) boa constrictor . Zoology does n't seem to have been one of John Derek 's strong points ..... This being a Tarzan movie , Jane becomes enchanted with the Lord of the Jungle and resolves to take his virginity . But having seen his closeness to some of those chimps , you do have to wonder ... Speaking of which , it 's not only the Edgar Rice Burroughs estate could have sued . It is highly probable that certain primates were on the phone to their lawyers : the chimps here make you miss Cheeta badly . Especially when they do ridiculous things like ride on the backs of elephants and clap their hands when Tarzan and Jane finally get it on ! The climax of this film has Bo and Harris captured by some rather stereotypical cannibals who paint our heroine and prepare to sacrifice / eat / execute her . Suffice is to say that The Great Wooden Ape gets his girl and * SPOILER * Harris gets himself impaled on a huge elephant tusk ! This does n't stop the dying Parker from delivering a rambling monologue to Jane . As far as I am aware , the law suit from the Rice Burrows estate never materialized but ' Tarzan the Ape Man ' was crucified at the box office ( no kidding ? ) A pity . John Derek could have directed ' Tarzan the Ape Man 2 ' with Bo Derek and Miles O'Keefe living in domestic bliss and Dudley Moore as ' Boy . '
pos	For those that were interested in knowing how exactly humanity came to be encased in big red pods that make me crave pomegranate , there is the duo of the " Second Renaissance " shorts . I 'm not exactly sure why they are split into two parts , especially since they 're credited as one on the DVD ( and are these shorts viewed on any other format but the DVD ? ) , but they 're informative even if they have a few gaps . What really makes this first part stand out , from the second part and the rest of the animations as well , is the parallels it shows between robot uprising and civil rights . Graphic homages to slavery , fascism , concentration camps , and mass graves are mixed with verbal references to the Million Man March and humanity 's God - complex . In fact , " God " is never really referenced by these shorts , instead replaced by " Man 's own image " . As far as the shorts go in the collection , " The Second Renaissance : Part I " is by far the most effective in bringing out emotion . It 's a sorrowful and disturbing view of the potential of humanity to become " the architect of its own destruction . " Some may be turned off by some of the concepts this short rips directly out of previously established science fiction literature , but then again , that 's basically what most of the Matrix series has done , and it 's been a driving force behind its success . --PolarisDiB
neg	The movie that shoots scenes of a scenic caverns tour . Remember no one from this movie except for Michael Pataki who dished out extreme pain as JC in " Five the Hard Way " . He 's the really annoying sheriff who I did applaud when he practices nightstick on our rabid doctor . Probably the most laughs you will have is with Dr. Beck 's epileptic seizures out of nowhere . Could Mrs. Beck be anymore wooden ? Seriously , if you took a 4 foot branch , stuck it in a hot tub , you would n't be able to notice a difference . The dread and suspense is looking over at the clock wondering when the credits will roll . Watch it as a late night movie , MSTified , but do n't go out of your way .
pos	I have to be honest and say I bought this movie , not because of the content , but because David Cubitt is in it ; I know ... shallow , or what ? - but , come on , Mr Cubitt is a fantastic actor to put it mildly . I really did n't know what to expect from watching this movie , I 'd read the other write up , and those on other sites but I have to say I was drawn into the world of the brothers almost from the get go . David Cubitt as Theo , and Colm Feore as Ryan are so believable as the two estranged brothers , the film moves through their relationship as they start to try getting to know each other again after their fathers death . The scene where Theo finds out Ryan is gay was played brilliantly , he literally walks in on a scene and tries to leave without Ryan noticing - which of course he has . The film has been very well researched and is therefore incredibly sad , moving , uplifting and a celebration of life in parts . I came away from this feeling sad at what Ryan went through but also with the knowledge that he was given hope and unconditional love by the ex drug addict brother Theo . I agree with the other reviewer who finds the scene where Theo says he will be a father moving , and I 'd go a little further to say I actually vocalised my thoughts at Ryan when he cruelly says to Theo ' What makes you think you can be a father ' and Theo says simply ' You . ' Theo walks away then , but that small exchange of dialogue speaks volumes to the almost self pitying aspect of Ryan who is brought up sharply by the simple retort . A brilliantly conceived movie on all counts , the acting , directing , writing etc are all so well done . I ca n't really find anything else to say about this movie , except to say that it is very hard dealing with the death of a loved one but this is done superbly , to the infinite degree . The respect for the subject matter and the outpouring of love ( without being contrite and mawkish ) speaks volumes in this rather selfish world we live in today . Well done to all concerned . Not many movies bring me to tears and give me pause to think about life in general , and also to be glad for all the things I have and not be sad for the things I do n't , but this movie did , it was unbelievably uplifting considering the subject matter .
neg	I wondered why John Wood was not playing Dr. Falken until I watched the film . BAD plot , bad science , bad acting and overall a bad film . Please do n't watch this film . Rent the original " War Games " if you are feeling nostalgic . I did n't like the bending of the plot to beat - the - terrorist - threat idea either . In the first film W.O.P.R was built because Russia had 1000s of warheads pointed at the U.S.A. In this film the idea behind the computer was to kill terrorist in training before they are a threat . Politics aside , one of the good thing about the first film was the highlighting that even a stupid computer could grasp the idea of the pointlessness of war in the end . No such insight is offered in this film .
pos	Really the tale of two cocky brothers and their respective falls from grace ( via drug addiction ) and later redemption . One brother , a self - proclaimed genius played by James Franco is your typical sensitive but intelligent man - child . The other brother is a hard - working future doctor who becomes less judgmental as he himself falls prey to addiction while dealing with the stress of living up to his family 's expectations for both children . Not too heavy handed as drug fables are want to be , and all in all a pretty realistic sketch of the family dynamics that drug problems bring about . I 'd recommend it to anyone interested in such character studies and commend James Franco for his efforts in what was obviously a labor of love .
neg	What happened ? ' Doubt ' had so much potential to be a brilliant film - but instead it faltered with a dragging simplistic plot line which made me want to stop watching . The only thing the film had going for it was the brilliance of Meryl Streep , who no DOUBT deserved the Oscar - nomination . Though it was not one of her best performances , she still gave a solid and truthful character to us which blossomed through the screen . However , not even the brilliance of a screen legend could save this film from going down hill . From the boring start , which had no power or punch - to the less than convincing ending , the film was truly a disappointment - especially since it provided so much potential through its promotion and trailers . It was obvious the director had trouble with the simplicity of the plot and he ended up with a boring film , which dragged on for too long , with too much talk and not enough action . Furthermore , the other Oscar - nominations were less than convincing . Though Philip Seymour Hoffman gave a decent performance , it was by no means Oscar - worthy . ( Especially since they completely left out performances such as Will Smith , in Seven Pounds ) . Amy Adams did not deserve the nomination . Watching Amy Adams was like watching a cardboard box - as it was one sided and plain . It would have made more sense to nominate her for a Razzie , as I am sure she would have walked away victorious . Viola Davis gave a short but truthful performance , but the length of her performance made me question whether the academy really should have given her the nomination . Overall , I consider Doubt to be one of the most disappointing films of 2008 . It was a mess of a film with so much potential , and I do not recommend it . The only shining light in the film is Meryl Streep , who though gives a stunning , solid performance - does n't even do enough to save this film . * * * / 10 .
pos	Holes ( 2003 , Dir Andrew Davis )   When Stanley Yelnats IV is wrongfully convicted of stealing , he is sent to ' Camp Green Lake ' . At this camp , the Warden , and her two henchman , Mr. Sir and Dr. Pendanski command the campmates to dig holes after hole after hole . But for what reason ? Stanley plans to find out . I never really had any intention in watching ' Holes ' , and i must admit , i only really watched the film , because i 'm such a fan of Shia LaBeouf , but even if you are not a fan of him , then it does n't matter . ' Holes ' is one of those Disney film that the whole family can enjoy . The story is lovely written and incorporates a wonderful idea of including flashbacks to the past . These are not distracting and really gives a great back story . All the cast are great . The young stars act well and the addition of Jon Voight and Sigourney Weaver are a joy . Shia LaBeouf shows that even at 17 , he can act without any flaws . This is one Disney film , you definitely would enjoy as a family . " I learn from failure .

neg	I just finished " Dark Chamber " aka " Under Surveillance " and I 'm stunned . Stunned , not by the film , but by some of the rave reviews I perused which influenced my watching it . The story was so ravaged by plot - holes and the majority of the acting so flat , categorizing it as a comedy seems appropriate . Seriously , I found myself shaking my head and laughing in bewilderment as I endured this movie . Justin leaves the confines of living at home with a pain killer - addicted mom to go live with his cop father despite Mom 's warnings that Dad is no good . When a young woman is found murdered , Justin becomes suspicious of the tenants who reside in the adjacent apartments . With the help of a couple pals , he installs covert cameras to keep tabs on these folks . As the truth begins to unravel , Justin uncovers an unexpected secret . One positive point is that Felissa Rose is HOT ! I would have generously slapped an extra star or two on here had she peeled down a bit , but no such luck . It would have been the film 's potential saving grace . Eric Conley played Justin very adeptly , I thought , and I would n't be surprised whatsoever to see more of him in the future .   The general premise of the film , although plagued by clichés , might possibly have worked had it not been for the ridiculously hollow " performances " of key cast members , most notably Alexandra Eitel ( Kayla ) and David H. Rigg ( Justin 's father ) . The horror ! ( pardon the pun ) . I have nothing against low - budget films . Indeed , I believe independent film is our only hope for decent film making in the days to come . I 'll cut low - budget films quite a bit of slack when it comes to special effects , lighting , even musical score and the overall picture quality . I do n't give allowances , however , for stick figure acting and a swiss cheese lover 's script . There are a vast number of competently - made low budget films out there . Sadly , this is n't one of them . I ca n't help but suspect that at least a few of the reviewers who have praised " Dark Chamber " here are in some way affiliated with its production .
pos	A very engaging documentary about Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy , whose work consists mostly of ephemeral sculptures made from elements from nature . His work is made of rocks , leaves , grass , ice , etc . , that gets blown away when the tide arrives at the beach or the wind blows at the field . Thus , most of Goldsworthy 's works do n't really last , except as photos or films of what they were . Now , one can argue that Goldsworthy 's works are a reflection of mortality , or words to that effect , but is n't it easier to say that what he does is just beautiful art . And at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter , pretentious , often mentally unstable people who live in decrepit urban settings , Goldsworthy seems to be the opposite : a stable , unpretentious , family oriented person who loves nature and lives in a small village in Scotland ( of course , I 'm sure those are the same reasons why he 's shunned by some people on the art world who found his works fluffy or superficial ) .
neg	With a title like " Attack of the Killer Tomatoes ! " , anyone going into this thing would be expecting either a ) a bad science fiction movie or b ) a comedy making fun of bad science fiction movies . It 's supposed to be a mix of both , with a dose of parody splashed in . Unfortunately , it falls flat very soon . You 're never supposed to take this movie seriously , I realize that , but you 're supposed to think it 's funny , right ? I found only a few of the jokes or situations were funny ( i.e , the side - by - side phone conversations , the Russian Olympic spy eating steroid cereal , Superman walking by Lois , etc . ) . " Attack of the Killer Tomatoes " strives to be a cult classic , but it does n't make it . A cult classic is a movie that is so different that only a select group of people understand it ( or a similar description ) . " Attack of the Killer Tomatoes " could be enjoyed by any 8-year - old with a bad sense of humor , so therefore , it does not qualify as a cult film . There is one good actress in the entire thing : Sharon Taylor as Lois Fairchild . She is a thin , gawky reporter , but has an endearing personality , loves to overact , and is a natural comedienne . Unfortunately , she is put to bad use here . " Attack of the Killer Tomatoes " is not as funny as , say , " Amazon Women on the Moon " or " Kentucky Fried Movie " , but it does have a few hilarious moments , so I would still recommend seeing it once . Avoid the director 's cut , it has interruptions by the producer of the movie and some supposedly " lost " footage dubbed in a pretend African dialect ( it can be found in English on the out of print tape ) .
pos	Any film in the early days of Orson Welles is a triumph all the way to The third Man with Joseph Cotton . He is also wonderful in a Touch Of Evil . Please see them all ! He tends to get pompous and self serving in films like F is for Fake , really stupid waste of film . Don't waste your time watching it . it is really ignorant . Orson Welles is a film icon and anyone studying film should see everything he has filmed . All his leading ladies are tremendous but in the end Welles became a fat drunk , like his character in A Touch Of Evil ! For some reason Orson Welles had a way with women , I see how he could be considered attractive in his youth , not like Gary Cooper or Joseph Cotton , or Cary Grant , John Wayne , I could go on and on but I digress ... and because I am a woman , I can see the attraction to him . He ( Orson Welles ) is one of the last true film makers and unless you count the film - makers of today : Tarantino , Scorscese , Spike Lee , most of the film makers just do n't measure up to the film makers of the Forties ! I know there are many more great film makers of today but in such a short amount of time I ca n't name them all . No Offense to any of the great film makers of this millennium ! August 21,2006 . Please remind me of some current up and coming film makers , I do n't want to be stuck in the past ! I love some of the films out now , but rarely are there any that I would put on a " 100 best " list .. " Hustle and Flow " was great , so was " Fargo " , and " Oh , Brother , where art thou , " from a line in Sullivan 's travels ; another fine film from the forties ! Can anyone give me a best list for the 90 's and on up to 2006 ? I would like to know who to watch ! Thank you ! Also Props to this website ! Where else can you plug a film or boo it ! i love the ranting and raving from regular folks like me who can say what I want and I promise not to spoil any film for someone who has n't seen it yet !
neg	WARNING ! This review will reveal the ending of the movie , " Scoop . " If you do n't want to know how the movie ends , do n't read this review ! " Scoop " is so bad you 'll think " Annie Hall " was a fluke . It gets one star because you get to see Hugh Jackman 's naked chest . That 's the only thing " Scoop " has going for it . Woody Allen 's misogyny , and his fixation on women young enough , at this point , to be his granddaughter , has crippled any ability to make movies he may have had at any point . The plot seems promising : a ghost , Ian McShane , directs a fluffy headed student , Scarlett Johansson , to investigate whether or not an English Lord , Hugh Jackman , is the notorious Tarot Card Killer of prostitutes . A magician , Woody Allen , helps the girl . Promising plot notwithstanding , the movie completely lacks charm , or humor , or atmosphere . It 's an amazingly leaden , amateurish effort for someone who has made even one previous film , never mind dozens . Perhaps Allen has had a stroke that has gone unreported in the press . Much is made of the fact that unlike in his previous films , Woody Allen , now a septuagenarian , has FINALLY allowed a younger male lead to get the girl . Not so . In fact , the plot is constructed in such a way so that the girl gets no one . There is an early scene where Johansson , for no reason central to the movie , allows herself to be gotten drunk , and seduced , by a powerful , older director . " Seduced " is a euphemism for what happens . It 's a " slam , bam , I 've got ta go " kind of moment . It bears no relation to the plot whatsoever , and it cheapens Johansson in the viewer 's eye . Why did Allen add that unnecessary scene to the movie ? Because it shows a powerful director - like Allen - having sex with the female lead . Allen gets to have his cake and eat it , too . Johansson is not yet an actress . She does n't know how to command the screen except by wearing a tight , low cut top . She imitates Allen in a couple of scenes , and that just looks weird and sad . It does n't help that her character is scripted as a doll who ca n't function without a ghost , or an elderly and less than awe - inspiring magician , telling her what to do at every turn . She is approximately half Jackman 's age , and she comes across as a very vapid screen presence in their scenes together . Audience members not obsessed with breasts deserve better in their heroines , and Jackman deserves better , too -- a script that gives the heroine some intelligence and agency , and an actress who can convey those qualities . Hugh Jackman is similarly cheated by the script . Allen apparently ca n't stand it that Jackman is so stunningly good looking and young , and so he gives Jackman nothing to say or do . Like Johansson , he is used merely for his good looks . This is a shame , because , as Jackman has shown in any number of productions , from " Oklahoma " to " X Men , " he CAN act . Here 's the big plot twist -- Jackman , suave , charming English Lord , really is a killer . So , though the movie says it is all about letting someone else , other than Allen , get the girl , she does n't get anyone . Jackman , the man she 's been making love to , is a man who murdered a prostitute . Nice , Woody . Nice way to punish your heroine for being beyond your grasp . In a passive aggressive touch , Allen deprives his heroine of his own presence , as well , killing off his character , the magician , leaving Scarlett Johansson all alone at the end of the film . A final note : at my screening , not a single audience member laughed at any point during the film . Always a bad sign when a film is advertised as a comedy .
pos	This movie is brilliant . The comments made before is from someone who obviously does n't get it . The movie is campy- yes ! But it is uplifting and fun . This movie is an underground hit and brings comparisons to Absolutely Fabulous . It is a must see !
neg	The whole Biker Movie genre has to be made up of the worst films ever made . This one delivers a lot of fighting , generous amounts of blood , bikers fighting Indians , and a shanty town that gets blown up and torn down one shack at a time . The acting is beyond terrible . What ever happened to Robert Walker , Jr. ? At one point he was in some major studio productions , and then he just faded away . This movie really blows , but if you have not seen a Biker movie in a long time , it is a good one to watch . At the end of the movie , you should feel a bit trashy for having watched it !
pos	This movie is obviously low - budget & filmed in British Columbia , Canada . The obstacles that had to be overcome to make this movie convincing(set in California & late 60's-80's)were well conceived . I believe this is the best & most accurate version of the Zodiac killings that plagued the town of Vallejo & the Bay area from 1968 - 19 ? ( he was never caught).Edward James Olmos(Det . Dave Toschi ) & George Dzundza(Zodiac - at the time believed to be Arthur Leigh Allen , since cleared by DNA & fingerprints)play a game of cat & mouse re - visiting crime scenes together , each one trying to trigger the other into an emotional revelation . Olmos dying from some type of terminal disease & knowing Dzundza did it , still totally obsessed to the point of losing his family & becoming a full blown alcoholic along the way . Dzundza totally oblivious & self absorbed(like all serial killers ) to the carnage left in his wake . The only disappointment was the"over the top " ending otherwise pretty accurate . If you tire of the typical Hollywood fluff or have an interest in the Zodiac case , check it out .
neg	I was thinking that the main character , the astronaut with the bad case of the runs(in his case , his skin , hair , muscles , etc ) could always get more movie work after he 'd been reduced to a puddle . All he has to do is get a job as the Blob . The premise of this flick is pretty lame . An astronaut gets exposed to sunspot radiation(I think ) , and so begins to act like an ice cream cone on a hot day . Not only is this a puzzler , but apparently he has to kill humans and consume their flesh so that he can maintain some kind of cell integrity . Huh ? Have you ever noticed that whenever any kind of radiation accident or experiment happens , the person instantly turns into a killing machine ? Why is that ? The astronaut lumbers off into the night from the ' secret facility'(which has no security whatsoever ) , shedding parts of himself as he goes . Apparently he retains just enough memory to make him head for the launch pad , maybe because he wanted to return to space .   Thus begins the part of the movie that 's pretty much filler , with a doctor wandering around with a Geiger counter , trying to find the melting man by the buzz he gives off . He kills a stupid Bill Gates look - alike fisherman , scares a little girl a la the Frankenstein monster movie , and finishes off a wacky older couple(punishing them karmically for stealing some lemons ) . Then there 's a short scene where he whacks his former General , and a very long scene where he kills a young pothead and chases his girlfriend around . You 'd think that after she cuts his arm off and he run away , the scene would shift . But no ... we're treated to about ten minutes of the woman huddled into a corner panting and screaming in terror , even though the monster is gone . All I could think was .. director 's girlfriend , anyone ? The end of the movie is even lamer than the rest of it . The melting man finishes turning into a pile of goo , and then ... nothing . That 's it . That 's the end of the movie . Well , at least that meant that there was no room for a sequel .
pos	This is a very good Spanish movie but I am worried that many out there will feel lost because many around the world have no idea what the Spanish Civil War was all about or when it was fought . Being a history teacher , I had a big advantage but could easily see how the film could be confusing until you piece together all the pieces . I doubt if this would be a big concern in Spain where this film was made , but for other audiences they may be a bit confused until later in the film . The movie begins with 12 year - old Carol and her mother returning to her mother 's home town . Years have passed and you gather that they are coming to Spain from New York City . Despite the strangeness , Carol speaks reasonably good Spanish and much of the film is about how she adapts . As for why her and her mother are alone , I 'll spill it now for those who do n't pick up on the fact that Carol 's father is fighting in the war on the side of the Republicans ( who eventually lost in this very bloody conflict ) . The movie gets exceptional marks for its lovely camera work and music . The rather slow and rambling pace is n't bad provided you are someone who can accept films this way . I have seen several other Spanish films about this war and this compares pretty well to them -- not better or worse -- just a decent slice of life film about those who are left behind as well as a nice coming of age flick . PS -- If you do n't know which side is which , the Republicans were mostly Socialists and they were backed by the Soviet Union and Mexico as well as volunteers from many countries ( including the USA ) . The Nationalists were led by Franco and were aided by Portugal and the Fascist states of Germany and Italy .
neg	I rented End Game , having never heard of it , but I 'm fond of political thrillers so I thought I 'd give it a shot . After doing some research on the movie , I found that it had initially been intended for theatrical release , but instead had gone strait to DVD . After seeing it , I 'm thinking , " no wonder . " The movie is shocking in its unoriginality . The plot and the characters are perfunctory . I figured out whodunnit by the half way mark but the ending was a curve ball . I have to say , I did n't expect it to end quite the way it did , but that 's not a point in its favor . The more predictable ending would have been preferable to one that is so bad . Perhaps the film makers saw how predictable the film was and so they decided to throw in a twist -- even one that made the movie even worse . Stay away . I want the $ 5.98 and my 107 minutes back .
pos	If the movies are to be believed , Chinese ghosts are much prettier and more mischievous than their Western counterparts . The storylines of the three ' Chinese Ghost ' films are largely identical , but the direction is excellent and the detail and colour is such that it 's not a huge problem . As always , humour is an integral part of the film , accompanied , of course , by a great deal of mugging . For those who have n't encountered the ' Chinese GhostStory ' trilogy yet , this film offers an interesting departure from the Western horror / ghost genre ; for those who have , another enjoyable romp in the Chinese ghost world .
neg	No cinematic achievements here , however that 's not even the important question . How does it fare in its endeavour to be a competent date movie -- and star vehicle ? The formula requires the cute female lead a la Ryan or Aniston -- check ; there 's a built - in TV audience ! Add thick - headed , compliant men , usually including the problem ex - boyfriend / fiancée -- check .   Assemble a plot that maximizes the bankability of the stars . So far , so good . What is the male lead to consist of ? He has to make all the women in the movie and in the audience ( and the gay flight stewards ) instantly swoon . But ... he can not be so hunky as to threaten to the male audience , and he ca n't outshine the star . Roll cameras ... The problem is Messing thinks she 's still in a sitcom ... she has only one presentation : as the wide - eyed doormat that she 's made a career out of . A capable actress might have pulled it off after the love scene , where things promptly nosedive into the soap suds .   You ca n't help feeling good for Mulroney ... you can read it in his face that he sees through all of this . He 's gotten all the respect of a lifetime .260 hitter . This time , he smacks one out to the warning track , and no one can figure out what to do , as he amusedly takes home plate .
pos	This film speaks a universal language ; one can relate it to the self , community , society or the wider world . It has a way of not only opening up several questions but also setting one in pursuit of discovering and asking the right questions in order to get to that point of self conviction / ownership . The portrayal of the stereotypes within the film addresses the archetypes around us which must be recognised as being the repeating cycle of destruction , the opposing force of innovation , creativity and growth . The factors which disturb the natural flow of things must be made apparent and tackled . The Idea , is definitely a film to be experienced and not just viewed as it taps into one 's internal voice / conscience through the looking , it makes one feel as opposed to just watch .
neg	I can always tell when something is going to be a hit . I see it or hear it , and get a good feeling . I did not get a good feeling watching the preview . I was not at all enthusiastic about this film , and I am not at all surprised that it is rated here as one of the worst 100 films . I was in fact proved right . The first thing that threw me off was the title . Not that I have a problem with ebonics(I am black by the way ) , but for a movie they could have used a better title , and for this time use a title that does n't have bad grammar . I heard the dialog , saw the acting and all I could do was make faces . I also think that the dance movie theme is being overdone . At least " You Got Served " was better than this in my opinion . Even the soundtrack did n't thrill me .
pos	Dahl seems to have been under the influence of Wenders ' The American Friend . Innocent Nick Cage gets recruited for a hit . Dennis Hopper plays a real Hit Man . Lara Flynn Boyle is dangerous . The Hero gets more entangled the more he tries to extricate hisself . And small town America does not seem all that safer than the Big City . Like it 's predecessor mentioned above , this movie has lots of plot twists and turns that seem improbable , but all lead to the cathartic self discovery .
neg	Lately they have been trying to hock this film late - night on cable TV commercials . Do n't believe the hype . I was one of the unlucky people to see this stinker in theatres . This is , in my opinion , the 3rd Worst Movie of All Time , just behind Mac & Me ( # 1 Worst ) , and Jack Frost ( # 2 Worst ) , but I must admit , they are all close and all TERRIBLE ! Really , nothing of this movie is funny , or disturbing , or anything else it claims to be so do n't waste your money . The only thing it is good for is giving to your worst enemy . I 'm not lying about that . Someone who you would love to kill or torture would be a prime candidate for this film . It is that awful . If you do n't believe me then you deserve to suffer through the misery of watching this , which I doubt you can finish . Two Thumbs Enthusiastically Down .
pos	I 've watched the first 17 episodes and this series is simply amazing ! I have n't been this interested in an anime series since Neon Genesis Evangelion . This series is actually based off an h - game , which I 'm not sure if it 's been done before or not , I have n't played the game , but from what I 've heard it follows it very well . I give this series a 10/10 . It has a great story , interesting characters , and some of the best animation I 've seen . It also has some great Japanese music in it too ! If you have n't seen this series yet , check it out . You can find subbed episodes on some anime websites out there , it 's straight out of Japan .
neg	I watched this film based on the very favorable reviews that I read about it here by others . They definitely saw something in this movie I did n't see , that 's for sure . The movie starts off at a good pace , and the first 15 or 20 minutes of it are interesting , then it begins to get logged down and draggy , not to mention completely unbelievable . Eventually you find yourself saying : " What ? ! ? He 's going to do that too ? Just how far is he going to go with this thing ? " The plot begins with Jeff Goldblum 's character , John , going into a deli to purchase a bottle of wine . There is a robbery and a new store clerk , Auggie Rose , gets killed during the robbery .   John gets in the ambulance and goes to the hospital with the guy . This seems a little much , but wait , there 's more . John becomes totally obsessed with Auggie Rose .   For reasons that never make any kind of logical sense , John , who has a very good life , a beautiful , loving girlfriend , a secure , well - paying job , nice house , nice car , expensive suits -- decides he wants to be a loser like Auggie Rose was , and experience life in a low paying job , living in a dump with a dippy girlfriend and possible connections with dangerous people . Why this dim - witted , half - baked film got favorable reviews I 'll never know . Sure Goldblum does a good acting job - he always does - and his looks have improved with age -- but unless you have a BIG infatuation with Jeff Goldblum and have to see every film he 's in , I would n't recommend this turkey . It 's approximately two hours of your life you 're not going to get back - and believe me - you 'll have nothing to be thankful about when those two hours are over , other than being grateful you 're not still sitting there watching this film !
pos	I laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt . Ben Affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a pretty boy Jack Black in this role . Gandolfini gives his typical A performance . The entire cast is funny , the story pretty good and the comic moments awesome . I went into this movie not expecting much so perhaps that is why I was so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and facially exhausted . I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy , can identify with loneliness during the holidays and/or putting up with the relatives . The best part to this film ( to me anyway ) were the subtle bits of humor that caught me completely off guard and had me laughing long after the rest of the audience had stopped . Namely , the scene involving the lighting of the Christmas tree . Go see it and have a good laugh !
neg	On Steve Irwin 's show , he 's hillarious . He does n't even try to be funny and he just is but his movie was n't even what I would call a movie - I mean when that guy on his car is trying to kill him he 's just saying ' Oh , this is one nasty bloke ! ' and looking straight into the camera . He put his face in the camera too much ! And then when the guy falls off the car would n't you expect him to be dead ? And Terri had the worst acting I 'd ever seen ! Like when the crocodile almost ate Steve she just says ' Steve ' . She did n't sound scared or anything , it was just ' Steve ' . I mean I hate to sound mean but that was not worth seeing . I love Steve Irwin but his movie was just too stupid .
pos	" Holes " is my all - time favorite movie ! So far I have seen this movie three times in theaters and am looking forward to purchasing it on DVD this upcoming September . I read the book after seeing the movie and was amazed at how alike the book and movie were . The director of this film did an excellent job of re - creating the book into movie form . Also , all of the actors selected to play the roles did wonderful playing their characters , especially Max Kasch as ZigZag . Props to all those involved in making this movie , it was a real success ! 10 out of 10 stars , I definitely recommend it for everyone to see !
neg	I had absolutely nothing to do the past weekend , and tagged along with my friends to check out a movie ... any movie . And since the only movie we 'd not seen was Inspector Gadget , we decided to go in for that . BIG MISTAKE . This is a movie that might appeal only to kids . Oh , and it 's not like I do n't enjoy movies targeted at the younger audience . But this movie had absolutely nothing to hold my attention . If you have nothing to do at home , go to sleep . Better than wasting hard - earned cash on this . Go check out the film if you 're a kid or if you 're a parent with a kid :)
pos	This is another fantasy favorite from Ralph Bakshi ; after watching it on YouTube that is . Set in the distant past after the Ice Age , it is a prehistoric sword - and - sorcery quest between good and evil . Nekron , Lord of the realm of Ice and his mother Queen Juliana , has set their sights on conquest of the known world . When their glaciers destroy 's the village of a man named Larn , he ( Larn ) vows to avenge his people and kill the Ice Lord . Meanwhile , the sub - human minions of Nekron and Juliana capture Firekeep 's King Jarol 's sultry daughter Princess Teegra ; but she manages to escape , and eventually meets with Larn , who promises to escort her back to Firekeep ; if the sub - humans do n't find them first . This movie did very little box office ( as did most of Ralph Bakshi 's films ) , but has become a cult classic , partly for the quality of the art , a collaboration between Ralph Bakshi and the famed fantasy artist Frank Frazetta . Also , I have heard that the screenplay was written by Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas , the two men who had done Conan comic book stories , and the background painters included James Gurney , the illustrator of the Dinotopia novels ; though admittedly I had never read Conan or Dinotopia . And also the painter Thomas Kinkade , noted for his artwork for figurines , music - boxes for The Bradford Exchange Company besides paintings . And like Bakshi 's films The Lord of the Rings and American Pop , this movie was rotoscoped , but the process works better in this film than in the former . So overall , I think it 's one of the best animated fantasy movies ever made , and an awesome collaboration between two great minds - Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta . With plenty of fantasy , sexual innuendo , and thrilling adventure .
neg	Elfriede Jelinek , not quite a household name yet , is a winner of the Nobel prize for literature . Her novel spawned a film that won second prize at Cannes and top prizes for the male and female leads . Am I a dinosaur in matters of aesthetic appreciation or has art become so debased that anything goes ? ' Gobble , gobble ' is the favoured orthographic representation in Britain of the bubbling noise made by a turkey . In the film world a turkey is a monumental flop as measured by box office receipts or critical reception . ' Gobble , gobble ' and The Piano Teacher are perfect partners . The embarrassing awfulness of this widely praised film can not be overstated . It begins very badly , as if made to annoy the viewer . Credits interrupt inconsequential scenes for more than 11 minutes . We are introduced to Professor Erika Kohut , apparently the alter ego of the accoladed authoress , a stony professor of piano . She lives with her husky and domineering mum . Dad is an institutionalised madman who dies unseen during what passes for the action . Reviewing The Piano Teacher is difficult , beyond registering its unpleasantness . What we see in the film ( and might read in the book , for all I know ) is a tawdry , exploitative , nonsensical tale of an emotional pendulum that swings hither and thither without moving on . Erika , whose name is minimally used , is initially shown as a person with intense musical sensitivity but otherwise totally repressed . Not quite , because there 's a handbags at two paces scene with her gravelly - voiced maman early on that ends with profuse apologies . If a reviewer has to ( yawn ) extract a leitmotif ( why not use a pretentious word when a simpler one would do ) , Elrika 's violently alternating moods would be it . A young hunk , Walter , studying to become a ' low voltage ' engineer , whatever that is , and playing ice hockey in his few leisure moments , is also a talented pianist . He encounters Elrika at an old - fashioned recital in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be Paris . In the glib fashion of so much art , he immediately falls in love and starts to ' cherchez la femme ' . Repressed Erika has a liking for hardcore pornography , shown briefly but graphically for a few seconds while she sniffs a tissue taken from the waste basket in the private booth where she watches . Walter performs a brilliant audition and is grudgingly accepted as a private student by Erika , whose teaching style is characterised by remoteness , hostility , discouragement and humiliation . He soon declares his love and before long pursues Erika into the Ladies where they engage in mild hanky panky and incomplete oral sex . Erika retains control over her lovesick swain . She promises to send him a letter of instruction for further pleasurable exchanges . In the meantime , chillingly jealous because of Walter 's kindness to a nervous student who is literally having the shits before a rehearsal for some future concert , Erika fills the student 's coat pocket with broken glass , causing severe lacerations to those delicate piano - playing hands . The next big scene ( by - passing the genital self - mutilation , etc ) has Walter turning up at the apartment Erika shares with her mother . Erika want to be humiliated , bound , slapped , etc . Sensible Walter is , for the moment , repulsed and marches off into the night . At this point there 's still nearly an hour to go . The viewer can only fear the worst . Erika tracks down Walter to the skating rink where he does his ice hockey practice . They retire to a back room . Lusty Wally is unable to resist the hands tugging at his trousers . His ' baby gravy ' is soon expelled with other stomach contents . Ho hum . Repulsed but hooked , perhaps desirous of revenge for the insult so recently barfed on the floor , Walter returns to Erika 's apartment . Can you guess what happens now ? It 's not very deep or difficult . Yes , he becomes a brute while Erika becomes a victim . One moment he 's locking maman in her room and slapping Erika , the next he 's kicking her in the face , having sex with her and renewing his declarations of love .   Am I being unfair in this summary ? Watch the film if you want , but I 'd advise you not to . Anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if they 're in the right mood . I could expatiate at the challenging depiction of human relationships conveyed by this film if I wanted . But I ' prefer not to ' , because this is a cheap and nasty film that appeals to base instincts and says nothing . I 'm supposed to say that parentally repressed Erika longs for love , ineffectively seeks it in pornography , inappropriately rejects it when it literally appears , pink and throbbing , under her nose , belatedly realises that she does n't like being hurt , blah , blah , blah . The world has , for reasons not explained , stunted her . She apparently makes a monster out of someone who appeared superficially loving - but surely we all know that any man is potentially a violent rapist , because that 's his essential nature however much he tries to tell himself and the world otherwise . At the end , if you have the patience to be there , there 's a small twist . Before going to the final scene , where she 's due to perform as a substitute for the underwear - soiling student with the lacerated hands , Erika packs a knife in her handbag . For Walter ? Yes , you 're ahead of me . She stabs herself in a none life - threatening area and leaves . Roll credits . If this earned the second prize at Cannes , just how bad were the rest of the entries ?
pos	Many of the reviews and comments I have read about this movie say that this is a rather stale film and performance by Clara Bow . Although the story - line was rather typical of Clara 's later silents , I still find it somewhat heart - stirring and incredibly fun . Clara plays a happy - go - lucky Hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves ... never mind that this man is married ! Clara 's lack of modesty was shocking in the day , but I believe it lends to the sweetness and general fun of the movie . Though definitely not a brilliant story - line ( quite typical , actually ) , this movie is a nice showcase of Clara 's ability to make the audience laugh .
neg	We purchased this series on DVD because of all of the glowing reviews we had seen here . I gave it three stars because there can be little doubt that sometimes the acting , directing and writing are brilliant . In fact they are so brilliant we did not see the propaganda that was being transmitted so smoothly on the series . If one watches it with discernment , one will see the entire litany of the radical right wing beliefs being promulgated by the Fox ( Faux ) News Network . To avoid giving away any spoilers I will refrain from pointing out all of the dozens of specific instances . A brief look at the plots found here on IMDb will disclose that everything from torture to gun control to the right of a network to provide " Infomercials " and call them news is justified with cute plot twists and impassioned speeches given by some of the best actors in the world . We watched many shows and finally gave up in disgust when they justified torture using Attorney General Gonzales as a shining example of why all kinds of torture should be used in the name of protecting all of us . The series also manages to demean male and female gays in subtle ways by using them as plot devices depicting evil people . All in all the complete litany of the radical religious right wing . No doubt the popularity of this program will be used by future historians as proof that America lost its way in the early part of the this century . As a student of history myself I would characterize this program as being in a league with the propaganda produced by Goebbels for Hitler and some of the propaganda produced by Hollywood for the American audience during WWII . So if you want to use this as a teaching tool to help your students understand how subtle propaganda can be then by all means do so . Just be sure to purchase an inexpensive used copy so you can avoid enriching the ultra right wingers at Faux Network who produced this travesty .
pos	Frownland is like one of those intensely embarrassing situations where you end up laughing out loud at exactly the wrong time ; and just at the moment you realize you should n't be laughing , you 've already reached the pinnacle of voice resoundness ; and as you look around you at the ghostly white faces with their gaping wide - open mouths and glazen eyes , you feel a piercing ache beginning in the pit of your stomach and suddenly rushing up your throat and ... well , you get the point . But for all its unpleasantness and punches in the face , Frownland , really is a remarkable piece of work that , after viewing the inarticulate mess of a main character and all his pathetic troubles and mishaps , makes you want to scratch your own eyes out and at the same time , you feel sickenly sorry for him . It would have been a lot easier for me to simply walk out of Ronald Bronstein 's film , but for some insane reason , I felt an unwavering determination to stay the course and experience all the grainy irritation the film has to offer . If someone sets you on fire , you typically want to put it out : Stop ! Drop ! And Roll ! But with this film , you want to watch the flame slowly engulf your entire body . You endure the pain -- perhaps out of spite , or some unknown masochistic curiosity I ca n't even begin to attempt to explain . Unfortunately , mainstream cinema will never let this film come to a theater near you . But if you get a chance to catch it , prepare yourself : bring a doggie bag .
neg	This film is based on the novel by John Fante . Could someone please tell me why ? I see absolutely no reason why this fine book should be adapted in this way . If you want to make a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek , then how could you possibly make a connection to Ask The Dust ( the novel ) ? -And if you wanted to make this story into a film , then why would you want to make it into a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek ? I do n't get it . The adaptation of the story is poorly made , and if you have read the book and liked it , I 'm almost sure you wo n't like what Towne did with it .   In the beginning of the film you 'll maybe find the casting odd , the acting bad and the cinematography just a bit overdone . But you hope for the best . I really hoped a lot during this film . I actually wanted it to be good . But it only gets worse , and it is as simple as that : Whether you read Fantes novel or not , this is not a good film . Just another romantic melodramatic Hollywood production combined with bad acting , lack of structure and - of course - plenty of shots of Colin Farells naked butt . I could complain a lot more about this film , but why waste my time . I 've seen it . Alright . I had to see it , because I like the book so much and was curious . And I 'm very disappointed . 1/10 is for Colin 's sweet little mustache in the end of the film . So sweet ... Had he worn it the whole time through , I 'd given it 2/10 .
pos	Maybe the movie itself is n't one of the best Jackie Chan 's movies , but I think everybody will agree with me that the mall fight was one of the best fighting scenes ever made . There also was some memorable stunts , which were so impressive that they made this movie an action classic . This movie influenced many other action movies and I think that nowadays action movie makers should learn from this film ( like they could remake that chase scene , I thing with modern technologies they could make it even better ) . There also were some funny scenes which made this movie enjoyable even when Jackie was n't fighting . Althou I think they could put more fighting scenes in this film .
neg	In the future of 1985 , a governmental committee headed by Howard Hesseman , is holding hearings on TV 's first uncensored network . They sample it 's programming , that play as a series of skits . I can name the good ' skit ' movies on one hand , not using my thumb . " Amazon Women on the Moon " , " Kentucky Fried Movie " , " The Meaning of Life " , and " Mr. Mike 's Mondo Video " . Notice how I did n't mention " Tunnel Vision " ? The reason for that is that this ' movie ' is death in cinematic form . None of the skits are even remotely funny , or even the least bit clever . It takes some sort of great ineptitude on the film makers ' part to not even get one laugh out of me . My Grade : F   Eye Candy : Dody Dorn goes full frontal
pos	This is the best movie I have ever seen . I 've seen the movie on Dutch television sometime in 1988 ( ? ) . That month they were showing a Yugoslavian movie every Sunday night .

neg	I mean , really ... either i suddenly lost my sense of humor or this is just a really bad movie . It 's stupid , ridiculous and just not funny AT ALL . Since i saw the preview i knew it was n't going to be a great movie , i just did n't think it was gon na be that bad ... What happened to the good old times when you could find clever funny lines at any movie ? When the actors did n't have to play ridiculous roles in attempt to be funny ? . Now we find ourselves with movies like this one , Borat , Little Men , Scary Movie 4 where i could not find the funny parts ! ! Just skip this piece of garbage P.S. ( sorry for my English )
pos	In 1943 , a group of RAF Officers , including Eric Wiiliams , decide to escape from a POW camp using a Gymnastic Vaulting Horse in the courtyard . In 1950 , it was decided to film his account , and it kick - started a peculiar British Film Genre- the Military Prison Camp story that reached its apogee in Danger Within ( 1959 ) . The Wooden Horse is one of the quietest films I have ever watched . There are no great dramatic moments , but a steady storyline eventually builds to a climax that has more tension because the story does n't give way for unlikely drama , jump cuts or jacked up ( somethings about to happen ! ) music . It is utterly of its time and works beautifully . Leo Glenn , Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson lead a curiously low key cast of extras and ( I suspect ) non - actors . Without exception , all are constantly mono - tonal and quiet . They keep emotion out of their roles . As so many were , until recently , ex - service , I suspect they recreated their war time roles as ' Officers and Gentlemen ' . This unemotional approach does not detract from any dramatic tension . On the contrary , unlike most Wartime Escape Films , the story does n't end at the barbed wire : and that fact alone keeps me glued to the end .
neg	Ben & Arthur COULD have been a 10 . Sam Mraovich wrote , directed , stared , and produced this movie . Sam should have given his idea to a good writer , director , and left the acting to somebody who could act . this is a good example of one person controlling the whole production . there was nobody to tell him , " Sam this is bad , really bad " . Jamie Brett Gabel 's acting was the only good point , but he could have been so much better with a good director , and better actors to work with .   This movie is so bad i think Sam Mraovich should be tied to a chair and made to watch this movie ( twice ) . the acting and direction was so bad , this movie was turned into a comedy . you just had to laugh , and in the wrong places .   A second good point .... this would make a great date movie . after the first two minutes you would quit watching the movie and pay more attention to your date !
pos	The first time I ever saw this movie was back in the 1980s as a wee lad . My dad actually recorded it off the TV . I must have watched is over 20 times , before the relatively recent release on DVD . I of course bought and watched the DVD and was taken aback by how much the dialogue had changed . In the first version , which I still have on VHS , the mood of the film , thanks to the dialogue , was actually very dark . However the new version , featuring Van Der Beek et al , is more comic . To put it another way , it 's like watching the original US release of Akira with that dub , before watching the remastered version with the literal translation of the Japanese . I 'm in no way complaining , the story and quality of animation are not detracted from , but it does raise the question of whether Miyazaki intended for a lighter or darker narrative and theme in his film .....
neg	Tatie Danielle is all about a ghastly old hag who torments her loving and oblivious family out of sheer spite . There 's a bit of subtext that might be about France 's colonial past but it 's mostly just Danielle doing the sorts of things ( like deliberately abandoning a small child in a park ) that would soon have a man picking up his teeth with broken fingers . Sadly , that does n't happen here . It looks good and the acting is fine and there 's nothing really wrong with the concept but it 's just so SMUG . God , does this movie love itself . Pity it is n't nearly as clever or as funny as it thinks it is . The only impetus in the show - sorry , movie - comes from Danielle getting nastier and nastier , and the only surprise comes from watching the increasingly improbable ways she does this . That 's right : just like in a sitcom , which is what this is , with the added ' bonus ' of delusions of grandeur and a 110-minute running time .
pos	Marvelous James Stewart , Vera Miles vehicle . What makes this historical film dealing with the FBI so good is the family element that is involved during a 35 year career as depicted by Stewart in the film . The film shows a history of the great investigatory agency . It deals with airplane bomb plots , killing off of Indians in Oklahoma for real estate gain , fighting organized crime , Nazis and Communists in that order . The human element is never far behind as Stewart weds Vera Miles . They raise 3 children as Miles ' heart goes out each time Stewart goes out on assignment . Look for a brief but memorable performance by Murray Hamilton . Years later , he appeared as Mr. Robinson in 1967 's " The Graduate . " The film has nothing but praise for J. Edgar Hoover . He certainly brought the FBI up to par . True , this could be viewed as right - wing propaganda , especially with Stewart 's real - life Republican views , but it 's well done , historically informative , and the view of the family so well depicted .
neg	As an engineer , I must say this show 's first season started out very promising . Most of the applied mathematics were somewhat plausible , and the relationships portrayed between the Eppes brothers and father gave the show an interesting edge . But after the first season , the show started degrading , heavily . Most of the mathematics and technology used in crime solving is now utter gibberish and very laughable to all people involved in science & technology for real . The involvement from the actors still feels okay and I can imagine a fair amount of money is still going into producing each episode , but in the end , this has degraded to a very unpleasantly tasting dish which is a mix of a grade C action thriller and CSI style cop show . If you are gon na watch it , go for only the first season and possibly parts of the second . Thereafter I would not waste my time . Myself , I gave the show up midway through season 3 . Season 1 - 8 stars Season 2 - 5 stars Season 3 - 3 stars Let 's sum that up to 4 stars . Since Charlie does n't know his math anymore , I wo n't bother with the correctness of mine either .
pos	If you enjoy romantic comedies then you will find this tale of two 30 year old singles who fall in love during the American League pennant race satisfying . On the other hand , if you are hanging around waiting for Kill Bill Volume 3 or Sin City 2 then you probably should stay away . The plot contains the obligatory guy meets girl 's friends , girl meets guy 's friends , and guy meets girl 's parents scenes . There is even a guy meets girl 's pet dog scene . That 's all par for the course in a movie like this . However , what I liked about it was that the plot delved into the decision making process people make as they begin to realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and is in fact a bit quirky . The plot centers around answering the questions ; how much quirkiness is too much and how much love does it take to trump those quirks ? It is interesting to see the characters work that out because deep down ( if we admit it ) we all have quirks . Barrymore does a very good job in her role and Fallon sorta surprised me -- he 's good as well . I rate it a 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy . Add one point if you are a baseball fan or romantically involved with one . Add another point if you are a Red Sox fan and subtract two points if you are a Yankees fan .
neg	Oh a vaguely once famous actress in a film where she plays a mother to a child . It`s being shown on BBC 1 at half past midnight , I wonder if ... yup it`s a TVM   You`ve got to hand it to TVM producers , not content on making one mediocre movie , they usually give us two mediocre movies where two themes are mixed together and NOWHERE TO HIDE is no different . The first theme is a woman in danger theme cross pollinated with a woman suffering from the pain of a divorce theme which means we have a scene of the heroine surviving a murder attempt followed by a scene having her son Sam ask why she divorced ? And being a TVM she answers that the reason is " That people change " rather than say something along the lines like " I`m a right slapper " or Your daddy cruises mens public toilets for sex " as does happen in real life divorce cases . And it`s young Sam I feel sorry for , not only are his parents divorced but he`s as thick as two short planks . Actually since he`s so stupid he deserves no sympathy because he`s unaware that a man flushing stuff down a toilet is a drug dealer , unaware that you might die if someone shoots at you , and unaware that I LOVE LUCY is painfully unfunny . If only our own childhoods were so innocent , ah well as Orwell said " Ignorance is strength " . Oh hold on Sam is suddenly an expert on marine life ! Is this character development or poor scripting ? I know what one my money`s on . And strange that Sam the boy genuis hasn`t noticed that if the story is set in 1994 then why do people often wear clothes , drive cars and ride trains from the 1950s ? But as it turns out during a plot twist it`s the mother who`s the dummy . Then there`s a final plot twist that left me feeling like an idiot for watching this
pos	I 'm from Romania i 'll try to speak in English . All i want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my all time number one . Seen it above 30 times at least and will see it for many years now . It has all the little things i like in a movie , it 's very touching makes me cry . Shows a whole lot of twisted love things and questions about love and reality , and the true things that matter for different people . It so happens that for me this matters the most , the love , the soul of a man , he 's inner being , and this i see in this movie . Perhaps for me it 's much more than a motion picture , it 's a proof in my mind that it could really exist and that you most make the best out of every moment you live with your soul mate . It 's a long way from reality to sci - fi , but .. what if . What if all the capitalism disappeared and economy would go down , would fall ? We would all be concerned about other issues and my thought is that , on your death bed , the bigger thing you remember , is not the wealth , not the adventure , not the countries you visited and the people that remember you . But the true friends and your true love and the hope that after you die , all will be god damn perfect and people would be good and care more . WATCH THIS MOVIE and probably it will guide you through your life like it did to me :) Hail from Romania
neg	When you wish for the dragon to eat every cast member , you know you 're in for a bad ride . I went in with very , very low expectations , having read some of the other comments , and was not let down . Unlike some other cheap and failed movies , however , this one does n't really remain hilariously ( and unintentionally ) funny throughout . -SPOILERS FOLLOW- First of all , plot it very inconsistent . Looking past the " small " mistakes , such as the dragon growing up in 3 hours , the whole idea it 's based on is messed up . See , the movie wants us to believe that dragons came from outer space in the form of meteorites which really were dragon eggs . After explaining this , they show some peasant poking at one with his pitchfork and the dragon pops out . Later , the obligatory " crazy scientist " guy babbles on about how dragons outlived the dinosaurs . So apparently humans were around when dinosaurs were , or we just have a fine little plot hole here . The other major thing is that the lab is blown up with a force " half as strong " as what was used for Hiroshima . Then two guys later walk in to check everything out , and it 's almost unscathed ! There 's even another dragon , which grew out of who knows what . All in all it 's very predictable . As soon as the guy mentioned cloning , I guessed they 'd clone a dragon . That means that our Mr. Smarty - pants security guy is n't so intuitive and smart as the movie would have you believe , if you ignore that I knew this film would be about , you know , dragons . Putting that aside , the second worst thing is the " special effects . " Others have mentioned the fake rocks falling during the beginning , the CG helicopter , and the dragon . It looks a bit better than a blob , but it ruined whatever it had going for it when it trudged down the hall in the same manner time after time . To their credit , the flying dragons in the beginning looked OK from far away ( although the one in the cave is probably the worst one in the whole movie . ) These things are funny to watch , however . The scenes where a million different shots of the same person facing different ways are shown are not . Nor are the " introduction " screens with the vital stats . Coming to the actors , they were n't the greatest , but I guess at least they tried ? They seemed more enthusiastic about what they were doing than many of the actors participating in the recent " BloodRayne , " for example , and you 've got to give them points for that . One thing I noticed though was that the woman who plays Meredith often had her face covered in make - up that was many tones lighter than the rest of her . She looked like she had a bad run - in with some white - face . The script is bad and cheesy . You do n't really notice the music , but it 's actually not too bad for the most part . The bottom line is do n't watch it unless you want to see it because you hear it 's bad ( like I did ) , although the only funny things are the bad CG effects . Other than that , do n't waste your time and money .
pos	This first installment of Crispin Glover 's personal magnum opus asks you to think a little , and so ca n't be recommended for any viewer who does n't want to sit and puzzle over Glover 's imagery or follow the surprisingly simplebut weirdly obfuscatedthread of his narrative . To the more casual viewer , yes , it 's probably going to come off as a confusing mish - mash of odd , startling , and disturbing imagery for imagery 's sake .   You get the sense that Glover does n't mind that this is the case , and he 'll almost as gladly listen to why someone hated the film as to why they enjoyed it . Glover 's innate eagerness for and about his work and how audiences interpret it is strongly communicated not only through the film itself , but also through the unusual question and answer sessions that he frequently conducts following showings ; he clearly hopes that people will continue to think about what he has presented . The easiest way to interpret and dismiss the film is to label it as Dada or nihilist , a juvenile attack on the modern movie industry from an actor who 's worked both without and within . But there 's a reason why Glover performs his slideshow before showing his movie , and it 's not only to sell books ; his books juxtapose and create a narrative from images and text that Glover pieced together , and What Is It ? does similarly with imagery drawn from Western culture .   What Is It ? is an endearing and compelling film in ways one hardly expects while viewing . Much has already been made about Glover 's use of actors with Down 's syndrome , and indeed that is one of the most initially striking aspects of the film . So jarring , in fact , that many seem to interpret it as some sort of far - reaching crusade to see a more realistic and/or dignified portrayal of the disabled in movies and televisionor , on the absolute other end of the spectrum , as a kind of direct exploitation of the disabled . But it 's not either , and maybe that 's part of what makes this film so uncomfortable for many : the underlying agenda is not a political one or one of hatred , but one of looking beyond the mainstream culture into a kind of outsider ugliness . It 's not a film about Down 's syndrome , but it is a film that is owned by the actors with Down 's syndrome who appear in it . I 'm the sort of person who is entirely gung - ho when it comes to ugliness and strangeness being portrayed so starkly that it is beautiful ; happily for me , this is pretty much exactly how What Is It ? presents itself to viewers . Glover uses the strange images of snails , death , and the disabled in part because he wants his audience to feel discomfort at either the sheer oddness of the imagery or the visceral reaction one has to the dying screams of an anthropomorphized snail . In some ways , the weirdly compelling ( and occasionally downright grotesque ) elements of What Is It ? remind me of the work of the painter Francis Bacon   he of the infamous popes , yes , and the odd distortions of the human figure that inevitably make viewers cringe and want to look away . Like Bacon 's paintings , Glover 's film manages to be opulent and humble , grainy and polished , chaotic and well - realized   and the contradictions help to make it all the more disconcerting . But still this is not an entirely serious film , and it largely manages to sidestep the greatest pitfalls of pretension through the use of humor that , for the most part , derives from the use ( and juxtaposition ) of familiar items , images , and names of popular culture . And when What Is It ? is funny , it is very funny . Overall , What Is It ? is an impressive first film from Glover as a director and writer , and his presence as an actor in the film proves not to be nearly the distraction one might expect it to be . Watching it is like being an observer in the kind of dream that is n't exactly good or bad , but just strange   and that leaves you feeling slightly grimy when you wake up . If that 's the kind of art you enjoy , What Is It ? is likely to exceed your expectations and be well - worth the effort of catching it in the theatre , along with The Big Slide Show and Glover himself . All in all , it 's an experience you 're unlikely to forget any time soon .
neg	I saw this for free , thankfully , and wish it was better than it was , but it 's really the same old stuff that movie studios seem to foist on us in the last ten years . Ben Stiller and Jennifer Anniston play a couple who are opposites- and yet they are attracted to each other . If that plot line does n't take you by surprise and thrill you , the movie wo n't either . Lots of sight gags and fart jokes . Halfway through the movie I began to realize that Ben Stiller really is n't that funny , but he tries VERY hard . And Jennifer Anniston really is n't that pretty , but her HAIR looks great . And Hank Azaria and Phillip Seymore Hoffman must have got paid a great deal of money to be in this kind of average ho - hum movie , I 've come to expect more from them . What was interesting was that I saw this after I saw American Splendor , which is a truly funny and original movie- and I compared the two in my head , and found myself wishing that the movie executives would be forced to sit through those two movies back to back- perhaps that would knock some sense into them and they 'd start making better movies with unknowns rather than this formulaic stuff that plays best on airplanes .
pos	Almost the entire film takes place in a public bathhouse in China . There are no fancy sets , explosion or glamorous people -- only fine writing , acting and direction ( Hollywood , take note ! ) . An estranged son returns home when he believes his father is dying . He is surprised to see that Dad looks fine and is going about running the family business as usual . In fact , he notices that his father and his retarded brother have really forged a close and caring relationship and it soon becomes obvious that he is out of the loop ! Dad is very traditional and this visiting son is from the big city and does n't really see the value of the old bathhouse . How their relationship changes and where the plot goes from there is exceptional and believable . I was happy to see that not every Chinese movie is an action picture ( such as those starring Jet Li or Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon ) , as I do n't particularly care for these frenetic films . The Shower as well as Springtime In A Small Town are two wonderful examples of good Chinese films about PEOPLE !
neg	I had eagerly awaited the first screening of this film ever since it was given to me on DVD at Christmas . Having reserved a special slot for it last night , I sat down to watch it with my daughter ( aged 17 and a Film Studies student ) , with chocolates of course , in eager anticipation . We love Jane Austin . After just the first two minutes we knew we were sunk . The shaky camera shots and angles , general poor cinematography , direction and wooden performances had already left us feeling flat and dissatisfied . Despondent , we viewed on . Anne , played by Sally Hawkins , looked oddly and with no particular purpose , directly at the camera on several occasions , breaking our hard - won ' fantasy of the moment ' and engaging us directly in an almost ' I 'll find you ' stalking fashion . Poor Rupert Penry - Jones , who played Captain Wentworth , did his best with the script and direction , bless him . I hope they paid him well , however , as he was practically drowned on one occasion by a huge wave which predictably breached the seawall , drenching him and his co - actor . They were nearly swept out to sea . Health and Safety would have had a field day ! Poor Rupert was left spitting out sea water in order to deliver his line . Presumably there was not enough money left in the kitty for a re - shoot of this scene . Anyone with any sense would have not attempted it on such a day in the first place . Other than Mr. Penry - Jones , Alice Krige gave the only convincing performance as Lady Russell but her efforts were soon counterbalanced by those of Anthony Head 's unconvincing portrayal of annoying Sir Walter Elliott . Towards the long - awaited end of the film , Captain Wentworth appeared to oddly grace Anne with a visit every two seconds having taken great pains to avoid her for the majority of the movie . It was as if he had developed a memory impediment which caused him to forget his very reason for being . In contrast , Anne ran , hyper - ventilating , from pillar to post in search of the good Captain who , in the meantime , had managed to call upon almost the entirety of Bath we are told , in the course of only three or four minutes , without even having worked up a sweat . We experienced none of Anne 's charms crossing the screen . Indeed , we were left wondering what charismatic Captain Wentworth had ever seen in plain , spineless , opinion - less Anne and why someone , anyone , did not tell mean , winging Sir Walter to just shut the heck up . The crucial kiss , normally our favourite girlie moment , was painfully drawn out . As they moved in closer , Anne kept opening and closing her mouth which had the effect on screen of making her look as if she were chewing gum before lips finally met . Eww !   The most enjoyable thing about last night was the chocolates and the half hour exchange of views between mother and daughter on just how bad the film had been . What a pity to ruin such an enchanting and engaging story , filmed in some of England 's finest scenery . Sorry Jane .
pos	Go see this movie for the gorgeous imagery of Andy Goldsworthy 's sculptures , and treat yourself to a thoroughly eye - opening and relaxing experience . The music perfectly complements the footage , but never draws attention towards itself . Some commentators called the interview snippets with the artist a weak spot , but consider this : why would you expand on this in a movie , if you can read Andy 's musings at length in his books , or attend one of his excellent lectures ? This medium is much more suitable to show the ephemeral nature of the artist 's works , and is used expertly in this respect .
neg	Maybe you should n't compare , but Wild Style and Style Wars are original Hip Hop . Beat Street does have a lot of the original artists of early Hip Hop , but they 've been obviously made clear that this could be their big break , of course for some it was and that 's nice . But if you view this as original Hip Hop Culture you 're wrong . It 's overproduced and has a Hollywood sauce . Rather look for the first two movies i mentioned . They have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto . Yes , the rating for this movie is low , but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving . This is probably because although the story , the acting , the dialogues and the direction all are dreadful , the music and dancing is what the people love about it . Me , i do love the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the death of Hip Hop ( i was so glad when round ' 86 a new generation of now classic Hip Hop artists appeared , like Krs One , Public Enemy , Ultramagnetic Mc 's , Jungle Brothers , Bizmarkie to name a few ) , and i still do n't like most of the beats in this movie and that is why it does n't work for me . I mean , Wild Style has not much of a story but the music there is great and authentic . Of course tastes differ and that 's alright . But as far as i 'm concerned , this movie is trash except for the break dancing and some of the music and so i ca n't rate it higher than a 4 out of ten .
pos	I enjoyed this movie quite a lot . I have always been a fan of Whoopi Goldberg and this movie only emphasizes it . She portrays a housewife in an African - American family which is moving up the social chain due to the husband 's ( Danny Glover ) success as an attorney . She moves to an all white neighborhood where the people are friendly , yet a little awkward toward her . The various events that arise during the course of the movie make for SOME laughs but mostly appeal to the other emotions . This movie is not so much a comedy as a drama . I give it a strong 8/10 . I highly recommend you catch it on TV or rent it soon .
neg	A pot - boiler if ever I saw one . A supposed thriller borrowing from " A Time to Kill " , " Silence of the Lambs " , even an inverted " In the Heat of the Night " with a little reverse murder , a la " Strangers on a Train " thrown in , it fails abysmally where all the above , to a large degree , succeeded . Namely , in delivering thrills . The plot seems condensed from a bigger book , making the plot developments obvious and uninvolving , while the direction lacks pace and verve . To rein in any kudos , a major twist had to be delivered along the way and here it fails palpably too . Connery is clearly slowing down in his old age , barely bothering with his attempt at a US accent and besides seems too old to be the husband of Hope Lange and the father of those gosh - darn kids of his . He even has a father in law who seems younger than him . Laurence Fishburne barely gets the chance to inhabit his role and you 're confused from the outset as to whether he 's a bad guy or a good guy . Someone once said that flashbacks should n't lie - they do , confusedly , here . The rest of the playing is merely average by a reasonable cast in their underwritten stereotyped roles . The supposed climax managed too , to roll by leaving me firmly entrenched in the back , not as should have been the aim , front edge of my seat . Mediocre sloppy Hollywood film making for sure .
pos	Delirious , near plot - less mood piece and if it 's more LSD inspired than the Devil then we must remember when it was made ! After a startling SM opening ( which even itself is not what it seems ) we move to soft focus and dream or imaginings or remembering  . Lots of literary and cinematic references and indeed this is the Franco film that Lang himself praised . Beautiful and mesmerising the film unfolds at a leisurely pace but has a richness within each fold . A rare movie to languish within . Old Jess could make 'em when he tried . Fine central performances too including the indomitable Jack Taylor and Howard Vernon . I have n't even mentioned the Lisbon locations - ah !
neg	There are many different versions of this one floating around , so make sure you can locate one of the unrated copies , otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing . Some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there . The cut I saw has the on - screen title WITCHCRAFT : EVIL ENCOUNTERS and was released by Shriek Show , who maintain the original US release title WITCHERY for the DVD release . It 's a nice - looking print and seems to have all of the footage , but has some cropping / aspect ratio issues . In Italy , it was released as LA CASA 4 ( WITCHCRAFT ) . The first two LA CASA releases were actually the first two EVIL DEAD films ( retitled ) and the third LA CASA was another film by the same production company ( Filmirage ) , which is best known here in America as GHOSTHOUSE . To make matters even more confusing , WITCHERY was also released elsewhere as GHOSTHOUSE 2 . Except in Germany , where GHOSTHOUSE 2 is actually THE OGRE : DEMONS 3 . OK , I better just shut up now . I 'm starting to confuse myself ! Regardless of the title , this is a very hit - or - miss horror effort . Some of it is good , some of it is n't . I actually was into this film for the first half or so , but toward the end it became a senseless mess . A large , vacant hotel located on an island about 50 miles from Boston is the setting , as various people get picked off one - by - one by a German- speaking witch ( Hildegard Knef ) . Photographer Gary ( David Hasselhoff ) , who wants to capture " Witch Light , " and his virginal writer girlfriend ( Leslie Cumming ) , who is studying witchcraft , are shacking up at the hotel without permission . Along comes real estate agent Jerry ( Rick Farnsworth ) , who 's showing off the property to potential buyers Rose ( Annie Ross ) and Freddie ( Robert Champagne ) Brooks . Also tagging along are their children ; pregnant grown daughter Jane ( Linda Blair ) and very young son Tommy ( Michael Manchester ) , as well as oversexed architect Linda Sullivan ( Catherine Hickland - Hasselhoff 's wife at the time ) . Once everyone is inside , their boat driver is killed ( hung ) and the boat disappears , so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the " Lady in Black . " So what can you expect to find here ? Plenty of unpleasantries ! One of the characters has their lips sewn shut and is then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally slow - roasted by the rest of the cast . There 's also a crucifixion , witches eating a dead baby , a swordfish through the head , someone set on fire , a possession , a Sesame Street tape recorder , the virgin getting raped by some demon , a guys veins bulging and exploding thanks to voodoo doll pokes and some other stuff . From a technical standpoint , it 's a nice - looking film with pretty good cinematography , a decent score and good gore effects . The hotel / island setting is also pretty nice . Blair ( particularly at the end ) and Ross both seem like they 're having fun and Knef is great as the evil witch . Even though people like to ridicule Hasselhoff these days , he 's not bad in his role , either . On the down side , despite all the gore , the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour . The supernatural themes are muddled and confusing , too . When characters are being swept into the witches lair to be tortured and killed , the filmmakers unwisely decided to superimpose the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral vortex effect that looks supremely cheesy . And the witch lair itself is vacant and cheaply designed with unfinished lumber . And while most of the cast is at least decent , a few of the performances ( particularly the " actress " who plays Hasselhoff 's girlfriend and the kid ) are so bad they 're constantly distracting .
pos	Ride With The Devil directed by Ang Lee(Crouching Tiger ) is another gem in this fine directors cap . For those unfamiliar with the history of the Kansas - Missouri border wars during the American Civil War . See this film & you will visit a sad piece of Americana . Besides some superb action scenes ( quite bloody at times ) . This is a story of love & devotion between men & one lady in particular . It stars Toby Maguire , Skeet Ulrich Jeffrey Wright & as the young lady Jewel , I never heard or seen her before , I want to see more of her).The acting is top notch , superb production values , very well written ( adapted from a novel )   This is a long film 128 minutes , but well worth seeing .   my rating is * * * *   respectively submitted Jay Harris
neg	I have never watched a movie in so little time . The only salvation was the fast forward function on the DVD unit . It was like watching a poorly produced CBC film . There was obviously no money for lighting , filming , sets , location , scriptwriters , editors , actors ... Oh , there was absolutely no story either ! I need to write ten lines of comment ... Bad , awful , horrible , wretched , anguishing , tortuous , bilious , nauseous , sickening , fromage , disgusting , flimsy , icky , yucky , pukey , stinky , smelly , vile , putrid , all - thumbs - down , and I do n't know if I can keep on going to complete all ten lines of just how bad this piece of crap - o - matic production was !
pos	Unfortunately many consumers who write reviews for IMDb equate low budget with not good . Whatever else this movie might need , more budget really is n't part of it . Big sets and lots of special effects would have turned it into another Lara Croft movie . What we have here is a step or two better than that . The nearly unknown Alexandra Staden is captivating as the enigmatic Modesty , and this is crucial for this movie to work . Her wise little smiles and knowing looks are formidable , and you find yourself wishing that the camera wo n't leaver her face . It makes it workable that the bad guy Nikolai , played by also little known ( in the U.S. at least ) Nikolaj Coaster - Waldau might take an unusually cerebral interest in her , something Modesty can exploit . She is able to divert his raping her with just a shove and spitting out " stop wasting my time ! " then storming off between his heavily armed yet suddenly diffident henchmen . Making a scene like that plausible does n't happen by accident . Probably the biggest problem I have with the rail - thin Staden playing Modesty is it just is n't very believable for her to go hand to hand with an athletic and muscled looking guy like Coaster - Waldau and beat him . She just ai n't a Peta Wilson or a pumped - up Hilary Swank type actress who can throw a convincing punch . Coaster - Waldau letting himself be overpowered by Staden looks like he 's just roughhousing with his little sister . Since this is not really an action film , this is n't a big flaw . I just hope they do better on that if and when they make sequels .
neg	I watch lots of scary movies ( or at least they try to be ) and this has to be the worst if not 2nd worst movie I have ever had to make myself try to sit through . I never knew the depths of Masacism until I rented this piece of moldy cheese covered in a used latex contraceptive . I am a fan of Julian Sans , but this is worse than I would hope for him . On the other hand the story was promising and I was intrigued ... for the first minute and a half while the credits rolled and I had yet to see what pain looked like first hand . Perhaps there are some viewers out there that enjoyed this and can point me in the right direction , but then again I know of those viewers who understand if not commemorate me , especially when we had to turn the video off , and that simply is NOT done with our watching ( we had to make one exception obviously ) .   If it were up for a remake , I 'd give it a chance so long as they had at most 1 % of the original incorporated into it . That 's all .
pos	I also just got back from an advanced screening of Redeye and I must say I have n't had so much fun at a movie in a long time . WES CRAVEN is at his best ever . He brings us an amazing end of summer thriller I was so desperately craving . This is THE thriller of the year .. no doubt .   All the actors are amazing and the action is realistic and fun . The F / X were great . It steadily built suspense . I was on the edge of my seat most of the movie . It 's been a while since I heard an audience cheer and clap and get excited in a theater .   If your looking for thrills , action and a GOOD plot this summer , REDEYE delivers . Go see it !
neg	Did anyone stop to realise what sort of movie they were producing here ? Now let`s a former marine officer becomes assinged to a group of kids at a cadet school so this should be a family comedy right ? Wrong . This is just a gross comedy aimed at teenagers with many bad taste moments .It might have been watchable in an extremely dumb way at this point but I found Damon Wayans voice to be irritating beyond belief . Does he speak like that in real life ? If he does then he has my sympathy but he won`t be getting any of my money from watching his movies
pos	This is one of the weirder movies I have recently watched . That 's because it seems less like a movie and more like an experimental film . Kurasawa 's experiment was to take a variety of individuals who live at a garbage dump and weave their experiences into a tapestry that offers glimpses of their generally harsh existences . Not every episode is depressing and harsh , but overall this is definitely the tone . Let 's see, ... we have a case of incest / rape , attempted murder , wife swapping , alcoholism , infidelity , death of a little boy after eating tainted fish , a man with severe depression ( he never talks during the movie and looks very scary ) , a hopeless dreamer who would probably be diagnosed with schizophrenia , a mentally retarded young man who thinks he is a street car conductor and spends all his waking moments " driving " his street car through paths among the garbage piles , a man married to a total shrew ( I think I liked her character even less than the incestuous rapist ! ) , etc . , etc . In fact , it is depressing enough that it seemed almost like an Ingmar Bergman movie set in Japan , as Bergman made MANY movies that tended to deal with mental illness and the hopelessness of life . Is it any wonder that after making this film Kurasawa tried to kill himself ? ! So , did I like it ? No . It was not a fun experience . But , it was a very well - made movie that definitely kept my attention and as a result , I really wanted to see what happened to these people . It was sort of like watching a train wreck -- you do n't WANT to see all the carnage but you ca n't help but watch ! Of all the vignettes , I think that the older man who tended to look out for everyone and who did n't really seem to fit in ( he was too well - adjusted and wise to be living in a garbage dump ) was perhaps meant to represent Kurasawa himself . Maybe . I dunno . If you 've seen a variety of Kurasawa films and have a high tolerance for strange art films , give this one a watch . However , do NOT make this your first experience watching his movies -- it 's sure to scare away many viewers !
neg	" A Christmas Story " is one of many people 's all - time most beloved films . ACS was able to take the viewer to a time and a place in such a way that very few films ever have . It had a sweetness and goodwill to it that is rare . So I awaited ( and awaited ) its sequel , " It Runs In The Family " . The film was almost released a couple of times , only to be pulled at the last minute . When it finally came out , IRITF was ( and is , I guess ) a total failure . The sets and cinematography were just fine , but the directing totally , completely missed the mark . The film was nothing more than a cash - flow formula of lazy casting , lazy writing , and disconnected acting . The narrator , Jean Shepard , who was one of America 's great humorists and story - tellers , forced upon us a false reprise of the warm wit he used in ACS . He over - emoted , and why he did that I 'll never know . He somehow managed to become an annoying , overwrought parody of himself . The writing and acting in IRITF is inauthentic and forced . The actors may have seen ACS , but whatever wit and nuance that was in ACS must n't have registered at all on any of them . The acting was embarrassingly slapstick and bereft of any of Shepard 's dry humor . ACS will always be a real treasure , but to call IRITF a sequel is to insult all of the fans of Jean Shepard and ACS .
pos	What can one say about a film that has one of the blackest , most nihilistic , and occasionally most weirdly -I wo nt say ' sympathetic' .. I will say ' charismatic ' villains in the history of the Cinema , and the best sword fight since Flynn and Fairbanks were in their heyday ? This is an epic about a stubborn , sometimes foolish , incredibly courageous and honest mans fight for his honor and freedom against tyranny . I loved it . John Hurt and Tim Roth were great villains . Jessica Lange was very moving , tender , and sensual .
neg	Perhaps I 'm out of date or just do n't know what Electra is like in current publications ... But the Electra that I read was far more manipulative and always seems to have a plan . She usually used others to do her dirty work and more often than not some sort of double cross was involved . Just when you think you have it all figured out she pull the wool over your eyes and gets her way . This movie was fairly weak on the dialog , the acting was n't particularly convincing , and the action was spotty . I was really looking for something more along the lines of Frank Miller 's book " Electra Assassin . " Which is much darker than anything in this movie . Special effect where cool , action was interesting at times , but more often than not the story and plot was slow or illogical . Tha Hand was not menacing enough , and Electra was not ..... bitchy enough . She 's the girl you love to hate ... but in this story , I just did n't care either way .
pos	Very smart , sometimes shocking , I just love it . It shoved one more side of David 's brilliant talent . He impressed me greatly ! David is the best . The movie captivates your attention for every second .
neg	This was a truly insipid film . The performances are third rate , and the dialogue is so stilted that at times it seemed to have just rolled over and died . My reason for renting this was simple : Find a movie with scriptwriting . I needed a visual aid for my presentation , so I figured why not use a clip ? Boy was I wrong . After searching my local video store , I came upon this , where it was suspiciously titled " Starstruck " . I thought , " What the hey " , and decided to give it a try . Well , I was very unhappy with my results . There was maybe one scene I could use , and meanwhile , I was practically falling asleep because of the sheer banality of the flick . So ..... I took this back and picked up Ed Wood . There 's a movie I can use as an example . Then again , anything would be presentable compared to the drivel that is " Starfucker " .
pos	This is a comedy of morals , so occasionally a gentle touch of bitterness occurs , but a lightness soften all sarcasm and irony flows till all of a sudden one moment will halt your heart and changes everything . This film , marvelously written and directed , is a gem that shines perfectly , with beautiful acting by all . Jean - Louis Trintignant is exquisite as usual , and Romy Schneider is a pearl , perfect and glowing , that is not to be missed . A truly wonderful film ! !
neg	Boy this movie had me fooled . I honestly thought it would be a campy horror film with absolutely no humor in it whatsoever , boy I got the cold shoulder that time . This movie was , and I 'm truthful , pretty damn good . It was not scary at all but the campiness and the sly humor really mad this movie interesting . Some to the horrible acting and cliché killings were so painful to watch , I almost laughed at how bad it was , but to some extent I enjoyed it . The killings all vaguely relate to snow sports and Christmas , which made things more intriguing . The POV camera angles were awesome . The movie is about a viscous killer who dies in a car accident collision with a chemical truck while being transported to prison . He is later resurrected in that very same chemical with snow spliced into the mixture . These were the ingredients chosen to make the perfect killer snowman . He than takes his revenge , as the snowman , on the police officer who convicted him . This movie had such bad acting , with the exception of Christopher Allport , that is was funny . I will say that I am also pretty disappointed that this movie was not a horror , but in fact a dark sitcom . They had a great story with a good plot but it was n't executed right . All in all I like the movie at first but now it is really annoying . But this movie is way better and darker than the sequel .
pos	this was the best bonnie and clyde movie i have seen . it has more accurate accounts of what happened and while it does nt glorify their crimes it casts the pair in a normal light . i give this movie a 10 . it has great actors , realistic scenes and excellent writers .
neg	This movie starts slow , then tapers off . After watching for about an hour , and seeing absolutely nothing happen , I walked out . I mean , nothing happened . Zero . Zip . Nada . There is no story . The characters are vague representations of the most boring people any of us know . The producers of this film could be sued in a court of law if they try to sell it as a " motion " picture . There is no motion . I could have told the same " story " with a couple still pictures with captions . The script is a joke . It 's just awful . I doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it . My biggest regret is not that I wasted 60 minutes of my life watching " Love In the Time of Money " , but that I missed a great opportunity to be a leader . I could have been the first to walk out , but I waited a bit too long . Instead , I watched about 20 people walk out before me .
pos	If John Thaw had never played " Morse " , " Kavanagh " , or starred in " The Sweeney " and other productions , he 'd be remembered for this wonderfully unforgettable performance in " Goodnight Mr Tom " . Superbly supported by an equally tremendous performance by his co - star ( young Nick Robinson in his first role ) , and an unobtrusive cast , this adaptation of Michelle Magorian 's charming novel is a fitting memorial to his art . When I read this story of an old widowed Norfolk countryman having to accommodate a young boy from London before and during the Blitz , I found a rather obvious time - line error in it , and credit must go to the makers of this film for rectifying this error . They also must be applauded for not over - sentimentalising the tale , and preventing what could have been turned , quite easily , into a mushy mess . If you keep a CD or video library then this feel - good made for TV movie is an absolute must inclusion .
neg	I am a dumber person for renting the DVD REDLINE . Chicago Pictures who made this stupid movie never paid Palisades Media Group to buy web ads on various automotive sites including mine which has an ALEXA rating of 16K. They ripped me off on the deal and now I am out $ 16,000 and they wasted much of my personal time ( peter rapport of Palisades Media ) you know who you are ! Please do n't rent or buy this movie ! ! ! It sucks and the people behind it are ripoff artists . REDLINE has a cast of losers and poor actors ! This movie is a Joke
pos	This is a brilliant and well made contribution by a group of fans , and considering it 's made in a back bedroom on a painted green screen it 's story lines are complex and twisting , and it 's characters show realistic depth and dimension . The CGI created by the crew is breathtaking . While it 's first season might be a little shaky , it 's final few are well thought out and well shot . Some fans might have thought that the Star Trek Franchise had come to an end with the early cancellation of Enterprise , but these fans do n't take no for an answer . I recommend this to fans and newcomers alike , 10/10 hidden frontier crew . Make it so ...
neg	I honestly had no idea that the Notorious B.I.G. ( Bert I. Gordon the director ; not the murdered rapper ) was still active in the 80 's ! I always presumed the deliciously inept " Empire of the Ants " stood as his last masterful accomplishment in the horror genre , but that was before my dirty little hands stumbled upon an ancient and dusty VHS copy of " The Coming " , a totally obscure and unheard of witchery - movie that actually turned out a more or less pleasant surprise ! What starts out as a seemingly atmospheric tale of late Dark Ages soon takes a silly turn when a villager of year 1692 inexplicably becomes transferred to present day Salum , Massachusetts and promptly attacks a girl in the history museum . For you see , this particular girl is the reincarnation of Ann Putman who was a bona fide evil girl in 1692 and falsely accused over twenty people of practicing witchcraft which led to their executions at the state . The man who attacked Loreen lost his wife and daughter this and wants his overdue revenge . But poor and three centuries older Loreen is just an innocent schoolgirl ,   or is she ? " Burned at the Stake " unfolds like a mixture between " The Exorcist " and " Witchfinder General " with a tad bit of " The Time Machine " thrown in for good measure . Way to go , Bert ! The plot becomes sillier and more senseless with every new twist but at least it never transcends into complete boredom , like too often the case in other contemporary witchcraft movies like " The Dunwich Horror " and " The Devonsville Terror " . The film jumps back and forth between the events in present day and flashbacks of 1692 ; which keeps it rather amusing and fast - paced . The Ann Putman girl is quite a fascinating character , reminiscent of the Abigail Williams character in the more commonly known stage play " The Crucible " ( also depicted by Winona Ryder in the 1996 motion picture ) . There are a couple of cool death sequences , like the teacher in the graveyard or the journalist in the library , that are committed by the ghost of malignant reverend who made a pact with Ann Putman and perhaps even the Devil himself . The film gets pretty spastic and completely absurd near the end , but overall there 's some good cheesy fun to be had . Plus , the least you can say about Bert I. Gordon is that he definitely build up some directorial competences over the years .
pos	I first saw Enchanted April about five years ago . I loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy the following Christmas . It 's about two women who decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April , leaving their humdrum lives behind them . They are very sad women at the outset of the film , and you ca n't help but root them on as they plan this get - away with two other women they invite along to share the expenses . This is perhaps the most feel good movie I have ever seen . It ' pure and simple , with no car chases , no animosities and no deaths . It was made with care and in very good taste . You can not help but smile all through it -- except when you 're crying happy tears !
neg	Perhaps not my genre but plot was horrible as was acting by Nancy Allen and Linda Farentino . C. Thomas also seemed uncomfortable in role of being seduced here ( while on marijuana ? why did this need to be included ? this weakened plot considerably ) . Also Farentino 's charac . would have been better had she had more respect for a relationship . Would does movie try to say ? not much .
pos	In my mind , this remains one of the very best depictions of Superman on TV , as well as one of the most faithful to a particular comics period . This series paid homage to both the Superman films of the ' 70s/'80s and the Superman comics series " reboot " of 1986-onward ( " Man of Steel , " " Superman Vol 2 , " " Action Comics , " " Adventures of Superman , " etc ) . The opening score and titles were stirring , based on the John Williams score from the films , updated for a Saturday morning action series . Marv Wolfman , one of the main contributors to the comics reboot ( writer of " Adventures of Superman " ) was a perfect choice to be involved in this animated series . Overall , the series had a more mature feel while continuing to be very kid - friendly . Superman was presented as believable , strong , and iconic . His recurring nemesis was Lex Luthor in his megalomaniac / CEO incarnation . The Daily Planet characters Lois , Jimmy , and Perry were portrayed well . One of my favorite appearances was by Wonder Woman , and the story revolved around her home island of Themyscira ( " Paradise Island " ) . Both her design and that of her mother Hippolyte were in keeping with the similarly rebooted Wonder Woman comic book series of the era , and it seemed like an equally well - done animated series could have been developed for her if handled the same . The one thing that is hard to believe is that this has not been released on DVD / Blu - ray ! It deserves to be .
neg	If you ever hear these three words uttered to you ... "Joe Don Baker " , be afraid ... Final Justice is the low budget action movie based on a sheriff in a Texas town named Geronimo ( pronounced as Heronimo ) . He 's an ugly , slimy , rude character who is on the hunt for a criminal in Malta who killed his partner in Texas . His partner actually slumps down twice in the movie . Very bad editing . Joe Don Baker ( Geronimo ) ends up in jail like 4 or 5 times in this movie , making the plot go nowhere fast . Plus , he shoots everybody like he 's in the wild west . I guess nobody told him it was the 20th century . A woman cop is assigned to show him around Malta ( who looks like Elaine from Seinfeld ) and she is the only one who can put up with the redneck . She must be insane ! The strippers in the bar are the most entertaining characters in this movie . Their dancing is shown throughout the film and I began to bond with the sleazy women . Well , at least it was better than watching Geronimo try to dumb his way out of something . The ending is flawed and somewhat predictable , and I was happy it was finally over . You 'll never forget that last line of Joe Don Baker from the movie . It 's so hard to imagine how he was in THREE Bond movies ... very weird ! Anyway , if you 're up for a laugh , then see this one on MST3 K sometime . Also , I 've heard his other bad movie ( among many ) , " Mitchell " MST3 K version is being released on DVD by Rhino . I ca n't wait to see that !
pos	Whenever people ask me to name the scariest movie I 've ever seen , I invariably reply " Black Noon " and to this day nobody 's ever heard of it . I watched it alone some 30 years ago at the tender age of 13 when my parents had gone out for the evening . As far as I know its only ever been shown once in the UK and sadly is unavailable on DVD or VHS . If anyone can trace a copy please let me know . If I watched it again now it would probably be a big disappointment but it has always stuck in my memory as a particularly disturbing little film !
neg	- A Mexican priest becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage or something - I went to see this movie because it was about non - WWF wrestling and so I thought it might be funny . It was n't . It is excruciating to watch . Embarrassing . Any and every opportunity for comedy is mercilessly squandered .   I admit I do n't like Jack Black anyway . After this I have been racking my brain to think of one good role that he has performed . The only thing I can come up with where he was o.k . was as a necessary foil to the John Cusack character in ' High Fidelity ' . Jack Black is one of those awful relentless flat - out ham - it - up knockabout guys ( like the little fat one in Abbot & Costello or Jerry Lewis ) who should be told that being overbearingly idiotic is not the same thing as being funny .   It is not even slapstick . It 's just irritating . It 's not even stoopid , it 's just stupid . I heard good things about Napoleon Dynamite too , but if this is anything to go by I wo nt be rushing out to find it on DVD .
pos	Zane and Beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats . I do n't typically go for military / war movies , but this was worth my time . It was serious , but it was also humorous . Beringer 's character proved to be heroic and honest . No matter what , you know that he 's got your back . Zane 's character developed throughout the film . He was n't just a suit , he definitely proved that he could be a hero and handle a gun . The ending through me a little though . It did n't really go with the action throughout the film , but I 'm glad that I saw it , nonetheless . It 's worth checking out .
neg	What a disappointment ! This film seemed to be trying to copy ' cutting edge ' comedy but the direction and the script was sloppy , sickly and sentimental in the worst film tradition . Jack Black 's acting / role was self - indulgent and self - regarding ... and the other characters were equally unmasking and uninteresting . The soundtrack was tedious . We are ( WERE ) fans of Black but none of us did more than mange a forced titter for the duration . Why did he feel he needed to make this mistake ? We will not watch another of his films without reading reviews more carefully first ! ! Was he drunk when he read the script before signing up for this drivel ?
pos	Shakespeare 's " The Tempest " is a model for this exceptional science fiction film . We look for differences . Prospero and his daughter , Miranda , are stranded on a Mediterranean island . " Morbius and Altaira are marooned on the 4th planet circling the star Altair . Ariel is a spirit . Robby the Robot is a man - made servant . Caliban 's evil hardly approaches that of Monsters of the Id. Shakespeare spares Prospero . Morbius dies when Altair 4 blows up . " The Tempest " is a comedy . " Forbidden Planet " is a tragedy . We wonder if mankind must suffer the fate of the Krell in some future time . Anne Francis is Altaira . Jack Kelly is Lieutentant Farman . Kelly starred with James Garner in the comedy / western TV series , " Maverick . "
neg	City girl Meg Tilly receives a horrifying phone call from her mother and , understandably shaken , returns home to her family 's rural digs , only to be faced with a mystery : why are all the homespun residents acting out in bizarre and unsettling ways ? Radiation thriller , with barely a nod to ecology , has small town residents going berserk , which ( laughably ) includes two women gazing at each other with desire in a public place and Tim Matheson receiving oral attention from a girl on an office bench . The picture is too silly for words , wasting Tilly 's wistfulness and quiet intensity on trash while forcing itself into a corner it ca n't possibly hope to get out of . Some of the cinematography by Thomas Del Ruth is good ( particularly a fire sequence set inside a garage ) , though he is let down by the scrappy editing -- and a fairly bathetic finale . Simplistic screenplay has nary a surprise nor a shred of originality up its sleeve . * 1/2 from * * * *
pos	Remember H.G. Wells ' " The Invisible Man " ? Well here 's another movie like it , only more extreme . " Hollow Man " is like no one story about invisibility as a weapon of choice . Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine , a scientific genius who goes out into the world of invisibility and making it useful for military purposes . At first making the serum was the easy part , making the person come back was not . Most of the first tries ended up unstable . Until one night , when he perfected the formula . And who else , but Caine would be the lab rat . The gorilla was the first and almost died , so when he came to , it was a close one . So when the did Caine , he decided to use it for fun . Then when he got tired of being not seen , the team tried their best to bring him back to the world of the flesh . However , the visibility formula happens to not work the way it should , and Caine would delve into madness . So he ends up being one mad invisible killer . It would be best to just get out of town instead of taking the lives of people that are close to you . I would care less about the ones who did you wrong . Great movie , plenty of fun . 3 out of 5 stars !
neg	Director Ron Atkins is certifiably insane . This ultra - low budget film chronicles a few days in the life of one Harry Russo ( John Giancaspro , who also co - wrote ) , a nut - job who receives a Rubberneck doll from his bitch girlfriend . He starts to take orders from the doll to take massive amounts of drugs , rape and kill , not always in that order . What starts off as being a balls - to - the - wall exploitation film , well stays like that , but it gets VERY repetitive VERY fast . I 'm leaning more toward the certifiably insane . It IS hard to forget once seen though . Kinda like if Tom Green ever did a horror film . My Grade : F   Eye Candy : Laurie Farwell gets fully nude ; Jasmin Putnam shows tits and bush   ANTI - eye candy : seeing John completely naked repeatedly

Watch the movie and experience the ups and downs of this great adventure - laugh and cry with the crew as they cope with unimaginable challenges along the way , and enjoy the final triumph when they arrive back three weeks later in their home town to a rapturous reception and some great surprises !
neg	Where do I start ? Per the title of this film I expected some degree of authenticity , in the end I was severally let down . This is not the story of Lale Andersen or the song Lili Marlene , rather it is a Hollywood ( or pick your film making hub ) story loosely based on some real life characters . I should have had a clue when I heard a heavy English accent giving the intro to the movie in German ; the blood red text ( title , artists ) should have been the 2nd clue . The story line is contrived ( Lale was not tricked out of Switzerland Rolf Liebermann 's parents , there is no info that Liebermann helped smuggle Jews from Germany , the original song had been recorded outside of the control of the NS regime not while under control , the record played at the station was picked up in Vienna while a Lt . was there on leave , etc , etc ) the costumes are poor and incorrect for the time frames ( SS black uniforms used every where from border guards to staff positions , these went away from daily use once the war started , etc ) , the characters are stereo types ( SA bullies in a club once they were essentially out of power ) . Do n't waste your time .
pos	Peter Falk is a diverse and accomplished actor . The movie is well written and the acting seems like real life . For all lovers of Columbo this is a superior piece of work . Because it shows what a talent Peter Falk is . He does n't play a detective he plays a retired carpet salesman . By the time the credits begin to role you already want to watch it again . The interesting part of the movie is that the message will apply to every person that watches it ; the depth of its ' pertinence will be the only thing that varies . It is a shame that the liberals in Hollywood only promote smut and skin because this is the type of movie that the people in the business should be proud of . This would be a great movie to turn into a live stage play .
neg	The wife and I saw a preview of this movie while watching another DVD and thought " Jon Heder , Diane Keaton , Jeff Daniels and Eli Wallach , it 's got ta be better than summer reruns , so I ordered it from local library . Well , any episode of " Lawrence Welk " would bring more laughs than " Mama 's Boy " . I actually felt sorry for the actors for having to read the script in the privacy of their own homes and I could n't imagine what it must have been like for them to have to actually say their lines in front of a camera . Perhaps , at least , maybe next time they 're offered a movie of this sort , they 'll " Just Say No ! ' A one anna two ....
pos	This film is available from David Shepard and Kino on the Before Hollywood There Was Fort Lee , NJ , although that is a shortened version with just the " behind - the - scenes movie sections . I 'm not sure if Blackhawk Films only had a film print of these parts , or they edited out the other scenes . The original Blackhawk version was retitled A Movie Romance . The complete feature does survive , but the preprint for this version had some nitrate decomposition , and a couple of sections looked bad , so that may be why Blackhawk 's version was edited . Directed by Maurice Tourneur , the film has Tourneur playing himself , or more likely a caricature of himself . Supposedly , director Emile Chautard and future director Joseph von Sternberg also can be spotted . Country lass Mary ( Doris Kenyon ) longs for a romantic man to sweep her off her feet . She dreams of a troubadour that will woo her , but is constantly interrupted by the only available local boy , Johnny Applebloom . Meanwhile , a film company from New York ( actually New Jersey ) is filming a western in the countryside . Mary sees an Indian ( in full headdress ) and raises an alarm -- spoiling a scene that the movie company is filming . She is immediately attracted to the dashing film star Kenneth Driscoll ( Robert Warwick ) . He encourages her to leave her home and try to become an actress in the big city . When she arrives at the studio , she discovers that everything about the movies is fake . The doors and walls are just flats that are hastily assembled for the set . That lanky walk of the western hero or the happy skip of the heroine are just acting too . The sets are on a big revolving stage , so the angle of the sun can even be manipulated . The black attendant at the studio signs all the movie stars ' " autographed " photos . The signs on the wall say " Positively No Smoking " , but everybody smokes anyway . Even the titles of the film ( which are illustrated nicely ) emphasize everything fake about the movie - making life . Movie star Driscoll is just as disenchanted with the ho - hum of everyday film - making . He makes a temporary split from girlfriend Vivian ( June Elvidge ) to pursue this " exciting " country girl . His plans are dashed when Mary 's screen - test is a stinker . We do n't get to see the actual film , but only the audience 's pained reactions to it . Mary is devastated , but she does n't want to admit to everyone back home that she was a failure , so she continues to see Driscoll and we she has lunch with him in the studio cafeteria along with other extras dressed as policemen , soldiers , cowboys , etc . Mary decides to stay with Driscoll . At a party with their movie " friends " , she agrees to marry him although there is not much love between them . Surprisingly , her mother appears , with a cake especially for Mary 's birthday . This causes Mary to re - evaluate her future . This film has all kinds of fascinating scenes of studios , movie sets , dressing rooms , editing rooms , etc . If you 've always wondered what went on behind the scenes when a silent film was being made , this movie peeks behind the curtain .
neg	This is arguably the worst film I have ever seen , and I have quite an appetite for awful ( and good ) movies . It could ( just ) have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it had been consistently tongue - in - cheek --à la ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW , which was really very funny . Other movies , like PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE , manage to be funny while ( apparently ) trying to be serious . As to the acting , it looks like they rounded up brain - dead teenagers and asked them to ad - lib the whole production . Compared to them , Tom Cruise looks like Alec Guinness . There was one decent interpretation -- that of the older ghoul - busting broad on the motorcycle .
pos	the photography was beautiful but i had difficulty understanding what was happening ... was there a lot of symbolism ? ... the 2 goldfishes - do they mean something in Thai culture ? there 's not much plot , not much happens and it just meanders along . no real start , no real middle and no real end . rather unsatisfying really . It was difficult to get into the characters as you never felt you got to know them ... it was difficult to know which scenes were imaginary and which were real . The move felt chaotic and disjointed . I do n't know what the pang brothers were hoping to achieve . Maybe if I were Thai it would make more sense ...
neg	The basic plot in this movie is n't bad . A lady makes it big and comes back to her alma mater to be adored . But , despite good acting by Robert Young and Eve Arden , the movie is a mess . The blame for this I place on either Joan Crawford or the director or both , as her performance is just awful . Instead of being a real person , she does a wonderful impersonation of a deer caught in the headlights . In other words , she stares off into space and has a " golly I am SOOOO stunned " expression . After just a few minutes it really became annoying for me . Now this is certainly not the only Crawford film I dislike for her performance , as she had done more than her share of overacting -- in films such as JOHNNY GUITAR or many of her later films , such as BERSERK ! My advice is to try a different Crawford film -- there certainly were better .
pos	So , Fox pulled the plug midway through a drama / mystery ... How lame is that ? Do they expect us to invest our time in their new shows when there is a realistic risk of never finding out what happens ? Why were n't the remaining , already filmed episodes aired in the US ? They were broadcast elsewhere . Hey , Fox ! Are you listening ? This was a great show , but you left us hanging . If you 're going to introduce new drama / mysteries , at least air a conclusion before abruptly ending mid - theme . Every time something like this happens ( and it seems to happen a lot with you - i.e. , Fox ) , there are more of those who will " wait and see " before investing their time . This means you will see an artificially low interest share , and are more likely to end the series . See ? It is a vicious cycle . Do n't let us down again ...
neg	On the surface , " Show Me The Money " should have at least finished a full season . You had the always entertaining William Shatner as your host , surrounded by a baker 's dozen of beautiful leggy models collectively called " The Million Dollar Dancers . " You had knowledgeable contestants who had interesting stories to tell of their lives and who presumably knew a lot of pop culture trivia . And you had big money ! So , what went wrong ?   The format of this game was the failure . A good game show needs at least two of three things : very simple rules , exciting pacing and the ability for the viewer to play along at home . The best , most enduring ones have all three . Unfortunately , SMTM had none . The rules for this game were among the most complex of any prime time game show in history . Let me try to explain how the game worked , as briefly as possible . A contestant began with a single word or short phrase followed by the choice letters A , B , C ( subtle plug for the network ? ) . Each letter was connected to a separate question , all starting with that word or phrase . Once a contestant chose one of the letters , they could either answer that question or pass and select a second letter . If they passed , they got to view the next question , and had the same option . However , if they passed the second question , they were required to answer the third option . After they answered and before they found out if their answer was correct , they then had to select one of the 13 dancers on stage , each with a different amount of money in a scroll by their side . They revealed their dollar amount ( ranging from $ 20,000 to $ 250,000 ) and depending on if the contestant answered right ... or answered wrong ... that amount would be added to or subtracted from their pot . Still with me so far ? In addition , there was one dancer who held something known as " The Killer Card . " If you selected the dancer with the Killer Card and you had gotten your question right , you were safe , and the game continued . If , however , you were incorrect , you had one final question to answer . If you got that final question wrong , you were out of the game . If you got it right , then , the game continued . There was no quitting , no walking away with the money earned until you either answered six questions correctly or got six questions wrong or you were so far in the hole you could n't earn enough money to get back out . Got it ? Okay !   The biggest problem , as I saw it , was a complete lack of tension , because of the design of the game . A contestant could pass questions they knew they did n't know , and answer many questions they did know , making the pressure even less . Then , they could still find a low dollar amount , even after knowingly missing a question , which meant there still was n't any " drama . " And the fact that they could answer five questions wrong and still have a chance to win was a big mistake . And the pacing of the questions was deadly slow : often the questions were so obvious , it was ridiculous to try to create tension , as if there was any doubt about some of the most common answers . The pacing , the lack of any real tension at any point during the show and those very complicated rules prevented this program from working , despite Shatner 's terpsichorean talents .
pos	Several years ago the Navy kept a studied distance away from the making of " Men of Honor , " a film based on the experiences of the service 's first black master chief diver 's struggle to overcome virulent racism . Ever eager to support films showing our Navy 's best side the U.S.S. Nimitz and two helicopter assault carriers , with supporting shore installations , were provided to complement this engrossing tale of a young sailor 's battle with uncontrollable rage . Some of the movie was shot aboard the U.S.S. Belleau Wood . Antwone Fisher wrote the script for Denzel Washington 's director 's debut in which he stars as a Navy psychiatrist treating Fisher , played effectively and deeply by Derek Luke . Fisher is an obviously bright enlisted man assigned to the U.S.S. Belleau Wood ( LHA-3 ) , a front line helicopter assault platform . Fisher ca n't seem to avoid launching his own assaults at minimal provocation from his fellow enlisted men . Sent to the M.D. as part of a possible pre - separation proceeding , Fisher slowly opens up to the black psychiatrist , revealing an awful childhood of great neglect and shuddering brutality . The story develops as Fisher cautiously but increasingly trusts his doctor and gets the courage to pursue a love interest , an enlisted sailor named Cheryl , played by a stunningly beautiful Joy Bryant . Fisher reluctantly engages with the doctor by asking long simmering questions but soon realizes he must seek the answers , however painful , in order to grow and move away from conflict - seeking destructive behavior . While all the main characters are black , this story transcends race while unflinchingly showing the evil of exuberant religiosity and concomitant hypocrisy in foster family settings . Viola Davis , a versatile actress seen in a number of recent films , is a picture of sullen immorality but is nothing compared to foster mom , Mrs. Tate ( Novella Nelson ) , who in short but searing scenes would earn - if it existed - the Oscar for gut - churning brutality . Films about patient - therapist interaction follow a certain predictability ( all that transference and counter - transference stuff ) but the earnestness of Fisher and his doctor / mentor is realistically gripping . It 's a good story , well told . Period . While set in the Navy , " Antwone Fisher " is not in any real sense a service story as was " Men of Honor , " an excellent movie that dealt with crushing racism directed against a real person . Nor is it truly a film about blacks . It 's about surviving terrible childhood experiences and , as Fisher says , being able to proclaim in adulthood that the victim is still " standing tall . " The persecutors shrink in size and significance as a brave and strong young man claims his right to a decent life with the aid of a caring doctor . My only quibble is that Washington is a lieutenant commander but is addressed as commander . With all the Navy support people listed in the end credits , someone should have told Director Washington that his character , like all naval officers below the rank of commander , is addressed as " Mister . " Not a big criticism , is it ? :) I do n't know why this film is playing in so few theaters . It deserves wide distribution . Derek Luke may well get an Oscar nomination . 8/10 .
neg	I do n't understand why people would praise this garbage . Its wrong , stupid , unrealistic , awful , and just about everything else . The film is a view on life , racial issues , prejudice , and everything else that strangely goes on in College . This is where it fails . It has no grasps on reality . From many questionable non - sense scenes in the movie such as for example A black man chasing down a white man with a gun , the black man and stopped by the security guards handcuffed and carried out while the gunman runs right past them . The same white man snipering down people from a roof topic which is stopped and beaten down by the same black man is then stopped and given a Rodney King style beating while the gun man runs free while a moment later being chased back down by only one of the four guards . As one previous reviewer pointed out Several white 230lbs men being beaten down by several black men weighing around 160lbs including the 105lbs Bust A Rhymes Another critical flaw in the film are the shallow uninteresting main characters . From the scared and confused white people and the mean , angry , and yet rightful ( ? ) black people . Its almost as its an insult to both black and white people . I am a white male and I know many black and hispanic people who agree that this movie is wrong to portray characters and giving them those characteristics exclusively due to their race . The storyline which I will explain now revolves around three characters . One a black athlete , the other a confused scared white girl who questions her sexuality , and the third is a white man who is also confused and scared , then blames his problems on black people in which he becomes a nazi later in the film . They all have their share of problems and adventures including sex , rape , fights , love , hate , prejudice , racial war , and oh yeah do n't forget education . Which all comes down at the end for the fatal shoot out . In which after they go back to their boring lives and think " being white is bad " . Does this sound alot like your college years ? Did n't think so . I do n't think the director attended college especially if he were to make this awful mess . Overall this is a really bad , bad , ugly movie . If you want to see a more accurate view or racial issues go see American History X. If you want to see a more accurate view of college rent Porkys . Just avoid this mess .
pos	Wonderland is the fascinating film chronicling the x - rated film star John C. Holmes involvement in the brutal Wonderland murders . The movie 's promotion misleads one into thinking this a romanticized portrayal of the porn industry in the vein of Boogie Nights and that is not the case here . In fact , except for a few references made by newscasters that John Holmes is a porn star and a brief montage of real - life footage of John Holmes this film is strictly drama about a fallen celebrity 's involvement with murder and how it happened . Despite being mislead the film is actually engaging . The acting from all the cast is excellent and I 'd like to say that Val Kilmer is amazing in his ability to get down all the mannerisms of John Holmes . I was completely convinced that I was watching what John C. Holmes probably looked and acted like in real life . If you are a John C. Holmes fan or like stories about Hollywood then I think you will enjoy watching Wonderland .
neg	Proof that not everything Tarantino touches turns to gold . This is most definitely plastic , all the way . Its easy to see that without Quentin 's involvement this would have probably sat on the shelf for years , that 's assuming it would have ever got produced in the first place . It is about a woman with a fascination of death who gets a job cleaning up after crime scenes , Angela Jones is unconvincing in this role , William Baldwin is better as the Serial Killer who keeps Jones in employment!. All in all pretty poor .
pos	Hello Playmates . I recently watched this film for the first time ever and it is also my first experience of Arthur Askey , I have to admit I was very impressed by this film . As a fan of black and white films generally , passport to pimlico , the lavender hill mob and Tommy Trinder ( who is apparently a distant relative ) , this film appealed in that it provided good old fashioned British humour . I notice that there are some on here who have criticised Askey 's performance , however in my opinion it stands the test of time as a fine example of forties comic acting and if anything adds to the picture by creating characters that are more than the mere stereotypes which seem to so dominate films now . If you can get hold of this film I would recommend you get hold of it , shame these films generally are n't shown on Sunday afternoons anymore . I am also glad to have had the opportunity to watch another piece of work by Arnold Ridley ( Private Godfrey in dad 's army).I thank you
neg	I agree with the previous comment , what a disappointment . Rented it thinking it was going to be a good movie since Mira and Olivier where in it . I was surprised by their performance , expected more since they 're good actors . Thought it was a slow beginning but it got worse . I even laughed at some bad stunts ! ! when is supposed to be a mystery movie . You can even guess who is the killer beforehand ! ! !   For real what happened ? ?   Sorry to say but do n't even bother you 'll waste time and money . Boring ! ! !
pos	A riotous farce set in the world of glamorous daytime soap operas ! This film is hilarious ! Admittedly , you have to have a taste for films with screaming , hysterical dialogue , over - the - top acting , and melodramatic plot twists . But if you do , you 're in for one hell of a treat . Sally Field plays Celeste Talbert , daytime TV 's " Queen of Misery . " Celeste 's cushy life is thrown into upheaval with the unexpected arrival of Lori Craven ( Elisabeth Shue ) , her long - lost niece , and , simultaneously , Jeffrey Anderson ( Kevin Kline - splendid as always ) , Celeste 's long - ago lover . But Celeste has been hiding a deep , dark secret , and the arrival of Lori and Jeffrey might just bring it to the surface . Add in the diabolical Montana Moorehead ( a wonderful Cathy Moriarty , in full " gorgeous woman with testosterone to spare mode " ) , who is trying mighty hard to destroy Celeste 's career ; David ( Robert Downey , Jr. ) , the weenie - boy producer of the soap who 's secretly plotting with Montana to ruin Celeste ; and , Rose Schwarz ( Whoopi Goldberg ) , scriptwriter and Celeste 's one true confidant , and you are in for a heaping helping of subplots and general chaos . Chaotic comedies like this are tricky to execute ( does anyone remember ' Mixed Nuts ' ? ) , but when done well , can be pretty damn funny ! A major ingredient that is necessary to any good comedy is the casting of seasoned pros who know that lots of times the funniest things are not said but seen in an expression or a look . Field , Kline , Goldberg , and the rest all work together so well and are clearly having a great time that it is hard not to become drawn in by their energy and enthusiasm . Shue is clearly the weakest link here , but she only draws attention to herself because she is surrounded by Field , Kline , et al . Moriarty is a stand - out in the showy villainess role , making you think of the hottest damn dominatrix you ever did see ! ! There are also lots of familiar faces that you 'll recognize in small ( but , nevertheless , all very funny ) roles , including Carrie Fisher , Garry Marshall , Kathy Najimy , and Teri Hatcher . Director Michael Hoffman keeps the pace swift and the histrionic plot moving toward the big finish . Mention must also be made of Robert Harling 's screenplay , carefully constructed to stage a soap opera within a soap opera . The dialogue is boiling over with great lines , delivered brilliantly by the actors ( I 'd be willing to bet that a lot of this stuff was improvised ) . Look , if you want to see a bunch of pros doing what they do best and having a great time doing it , get your hands on this one . If not for anything else , it will put you in a good mood and make you laugh !
neg	The US appear to run the UK police who all run around armed to the teeth and did you know that CID officers change into uniform when they stop work and go down the pub ! This has got to be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst portrayal of " real " UK police that has ever been foisted on the unsuspecting public . I can see that Mr Snipes might have needed the money to pay his back tax bill but what the heck a good actor like Charles Dance was doing in it is a mystery . Worse than the worse low budget " B " film of the 50 's . An hour and a half of suicide and time I will never get back . Avoid it like the veritable plague .
pos	Sarafina was a fun movie , and some of the songs were really great . Sarafina was very entertaining . I do n't normally like music things like this , but the singing was not lame like it looked like on the box . The movie was useful for learning about history because it was an interesting perspective of the Soweto rioting of 1976 . It showed you things from the perspective of the students in the rioting and showed you that they were real characters . Because you got to see them as real characters this makes you like them more as an audience , and makes you more sympathetic to them as totally the victims of the white government , who you can not sympathise with . The singing of the students is correct because we know from accounts that the students in the riot were singing and dancing before it became violent . The clothing of the students in Sarafina is very similar to the clothing shown in photos from Soweto . They made the movie actually in Soweto , which is why it looks very accurate in many parts . All these things make the film more accurate for someone using it to learn about aparthied . As viewers we must be critical of the way the history of Apartheid was presented . As I said before , you become sympathetic to the students - this makes it potentially less reliable and objective . Also , it changes some of the details from other accounts . In Sarafina it turns to chaos when the policeman comes into their classroom and shoots the students . The police and army were very aggressive at Soweto , but this is probably an exaggerated event . The police and army did shoot students , but there is not evidence of them going into schools and executing people like this . The fighting was more in the streets and had looting and crime . This is done in the movie probably to make you feel more sorry for the school students . The movie would have been more useful if it had some different information about aparthied . The teacher was arrested for being against the government , and the mum goes to work in a white persons house . But there is not any information about the government and why they were doing it or any details about the racist policies and laws . -By George S , Chris and Finlay
neg	This is a very bad movie . I laughed once or twice , and the storyline sucks ! There is maybe one funny joke , it is stupid and it is boring . Through the whole short movie , I was falling asleep and wondering when it was going to end . No one acts human , and everyone acts stupid and ridiculous . Rob Schneider acting like an animal is n't something I would pay to see . It looked funny , but the bottom line : DON'T WASTE YOU'RE PRECIOUS TIME ON SUCH A RIDICULOUS AND STUPID MOVIE . I was wondering when it was going to end , even though it is a short movie . In the beginning we thought it would get better ; but it gets worse . Stupid , all the way to the end . I walked out of the theater , and I would remember that movie as extremely bad forever . The writer and co - producer of this film is a Simpsons TV writer , but this is nothing like The Simpsons ( this movie sucks ! ! ! )
pos	Basically , this movie is one of those rare movies you either hate and think borders on suicide as the next best thing to do , rather than having to sit through it for two hours . Or , as in my case , you see it as a kult hit , one of those movies wherein the humour , the plot , the acting , is actually very hidden but for those of us willing to go looking for it , trusting the director well , the reward is : U laugh your A .. of ! ! The fact that U have to find the things mentioned above , actually makes the movie even more funny , because u get the impression the director is n't even aware of how funny his movie is , which does n't seem likely and therein lies the intelligence at the helm of this magnificient project called : Spaced Invaders ! !
neg	Just bought the VHS on this film for two bucks , Did I waste my money ! Hey , I dig Adam " Batman " West and Tina " Giligan 's Island " Louise , but hello ! This third rate production is a rehash of a dozen other biker films ; crazed bunch of bikers psychos ride into a hick town , beat up everybody and everything , and then are defeated in the man by a dashing hero . Adam West looks the part as a hero , but he 's missing cape , and his Batman uniform . Sorry , just is n't the same . Tina L. looks really nervous and frightened the whole show , but at least we know what happened to " Ginger " once she was rescued from the island ... LOL ! The bikers are a motley group , and known of them ever acted again or at least should n't have . Hell Riders is Hell to Watch !
pos	Convoluted , infuriating and implausible , Fay Grim is hard to sit through but Parker Posey is really the only actress who could take this story and run with it . She 's at once touching , funny , cunning . The supporting actors commit to it as well . I wo nt even try to tell you the plot .. It involves characters from Hartley 's Henry Fool and attempts a tale of international espionage . The film works well if you continue along with it - understanding it is . in a sense , completely ridiculous . It becomes more and more ridiculous as you plod along . ( I resisted the temptation to turn off the DVD twice ) . Fay Grim requires an adventurous film - goer willing to tackle something that is n't cookie - cutter . In the end , it offers something that defies description .
neg	The writer / director of this film obviously does n't know anything about film . I think the DP on this project was tied up and replaced with a monkey , because every seen was either too dark or had the hotter hot spots than the sun .   The story was awful , the characters were very one dimensional . For someone to have said that this film was made for poker fans and not film fans , that someone is kidding their self ( it was probably the writer / director ) . No poker fan in this world likes this movie . Even your money man hates this project . To go into a casino and play a few hands does n't give you the experience to write about poker . Keep your day job . And if it 's playing poker , then you must be hurt'n .
pos	As I am always looking for something new and unique , I watched this film online . I thought that it would be just another " B " rate movie but I was amazed at the acting by the two main characters . All of the actors in this film were very capable and well directed . The plot was wonderful and unique as well with an excellent moral to the story . This movie is definitely not for someone looking for a sex romp , " Dumb and Dumber " or blood and guts . This is a wonderfully poignant film showing some grim realities of life coupled with the kindness of the human heart and just enough frivolity to keep it interesting . I would prefer this movie to many " A " rate movies I have seen even a great number with high box office earnings . I highly recommend this movie .
neg	I ca n't believe how awful this movie turned out to be . I feel magnanimous even referring to it as a " movie " . The acting was flat , the editing was terrible and the plot leaves many major questions unanswered . The premise was OK , if unoriginal : a small group of aliens is living in the US and trying to slowly take over humanity . But it goes rapidly downhill from there . How could they convince a " human " to accept an alien as his wife in order to make they alien - human hybrid they require ? They show a larval alien but never show what it does . They have a plastic surgeon that can produce perfect looking skin on an industrial scale . They throw in the obligatory huge alien monster with teeth . The ending was almost too painful to watch . I suppose that I 'm mostly disappointed that Bruce Boxlietner would have anything to do with this . How could he say to the huge alien monster with teeth , " Get away from him you son of a b*tch " with a straight face ? It 's a long fall from his Babylon 5 days . Avoid this at all costs .
pos	I had fun watching Red Eye . It 's not a masterpiece , but it 's well directed and structured . Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are perfect in the role . Yes , it 's the same old story with a different setting but Wes Craven gave it a good pace . At least not another Scream with the usual college killer . It 's nice when you can see a clean , coherent thriller even when originality does n't stand out as its main character . Particularly from a film - maker like Craven that has brought so many innovative ideas to the thriller and horror genre in the past and that now just lends himself to bringing home what could have been a good TV movie had it not been released theatrically . Good job !
neg	' I do n't understand . None of this makes any sense ! ' , exclaims one exasperated character towards the end of Death Smiles at Murder . Having just sat through this thoroughly confusing mess of a movie , I know exactly how he feels . The story , by the film 's director Aristide Massacessi ( good old Joe D'amato using his real name for a change ) , is a clumsy mix of the supernatural , murder / mystery , and pretentious arty rubbish , the likes of which will probably appeal to those who admire trippy 70s garbage such as Jess Franco 's more bizarre efforts , but which had me struggling to remain conscious . Opening with a hunchback mourning the death of his beautiful sister ( with whom he had been having an incestuous affair , before eventually losing her to a dashing doctor ) , Death Smiles at Murder soon becomes very confusing when the very same woman ( played by Ewa Aulin , who stars in the equally strange ' Death Laid an Egg ' ) is seen alive and kicking , the sole survivor of a coach accident that occurs outside the estate of Walter and Eva von Ravensbrück . After being invited to stay and recuperate in their home , where she is tended to by creepy Dr. Sturges ( Klaus Kinski in a throwaway role ) , the comely lass begins love affairs with both Mr. and Mrs. Ravensbrück ( meaning that viewers are treated to some brief but welcome scenes of nookie and lesbian lovin' ) . ' So far , so good ' , I thought to myself at this point , ' we 've had hunchbacks , incest , some blood and guts , and gratuitous female nudity'all ingredients of a great trashy Euro - horror ; what follows , however , is a lame attempt by Massacessi to combine giallo style killings , ghostly goings on , and even elements from Edgar Allan Poe 's ' The Black Cat ' , to tell a very silly , utterly bewildering , and ultimately extremely boring tale of revenge from beyond the grave . This film seems to have quite few admirers here on IMDb , but given the choice , I would much rather watch one of the director 's sleazier movies from later in his career ; I guess incomprehensible , meandering , surreal 70s Gothic horror just ai n't my thing ! 2.5 out of 10 ( purely for the cheesy gore and nekkidness ) , rounded up to 3 for IMDb .
pos	After gorging myself on a variety of seemingly immature movies purchased on ex - rental DVDs , I figured that the time was right for a little serious drama and who better to provide it than Sam Mendes ? For a number of reasons , " American Beauty " does n't appeal to me as much as this film which is easily the darkest thing that Tom Hanks has ever done and probably one of the most underrated films of the last decade . For this is not a simple gangster tale lifted from its graphic novel origins , and is simply wonderful to watch because of it . And despite my usual allergy to any film with Tom Hanks ' name on it ( still ca n't watch " Big " without wanting a cat to kick ) , I 'm glad I gave this a try because this is one of those movies that you 'll kick yourself for if you miss it . Normally squeaky - clean Hanks plays Michael Sullivan , a devoted family man and father of two sons growing up during Prohibition in the early 1930 's . He is also a professional hit - man to mob boss John Rooney ( Paul Newman ) but has managed to keep his job a secret from his sons . But after his eldest ( Tyler Hoechlin ) witnesses his dad involved in a mob killing , the pair are forced to go on the run as John seeks to tidy the matter up . Soon , father and son are pursued to Chicago where a fellow hit - man ( a menacing Jude Law ) is waiting for them . On the face of it , it reads like a pretty standard gangster film but as I 've said , this is n't really about gangsters at all . It 's about the relationship between a father and son thrown together in the most tragic of circumstances . Hanks is ( * grits teeth * ) superb as the tortured man who finds out that everything has its price and little Hoechlin is also good as Sullivan 's son . In all honesty , there is not a single performance that I could single out as weaker than the others - the cast is pretty much faultless . As is the cinematography and costumes ( and it 's not often I praise costumes ! ) which recreates the 30 's with stunning effect . There has been so much effort to get everything right and it pays off in spades . This could easily have looked rubbish - they admit that the early 30 's look was difficult to put down - but it does n't and that deserves every bit of credit . Chicago especially looks fantastic , lined with hundreds of rickety cars from the era and filled with people in monochrome suits and hats . True time - travel , even if a little CGI is needed . The story is also a winner , offering a human face to what is often seen as a stereotypical genre of movie villain . Law is surprisingly menacing as the almost mechanical killer Maguire and proves that you do n't have to be Cagney or De Niro or Brando to play a gangster . The film is decidedly noir - ish , driving rain and ill - lit warehouses predominate but at least violence and killing are ( finally ) seen to have an emotional and psychological impact on those who perpetrate and those who merely witness such acts . The whole thing is evocative of a previous age and previous movies but it sweeps away the old and refreshes with a modern tale of redemption amid the Tommy - Gun shootouts and extortion rackets . It can feel a little slow in places , especially if you 're used to masses of gun - play in movies like most modern audiences ( like yours truly ) but sometimes , words can speak louder than actions . Mendes has delivered a fine follow - up to his Oscar - winning debut , a film which is as intelligent as it is beautiful to watch . " Road To Perdition " may not be to everyone 's tastes but this is one DVD I shall not be exchanging anytime soon .
neg	I was raised in a " very Christian " household since birth . I was saved before I saw this movie and the rest of the series and was forced to watch it in a youth group at my church . This movie was highly disturbing . I saw it when I was about 12 years old and literally had nightmares about it for years . I used to lay awake in bed and listen for the sounds of my mom 's footsteps upstairs . If I did n't hear her footsteps , I would sneak upstairs to make sure she had n't been raptured . I used to pray so hard every night for salvation because I was terrified of Jesus forgetting me . This is definitely not something I will show to my kids until they are much older , if at all . It took me years to shake the fear that this movie gave me .
pos	Fabulous actors , beautiful scenery , stark reality . I wo n't elaborate on all of the other reviewers ' comments because you get the picture ! However , the movie is n't for the squeamish . Reality is slaughtering pigs and other livestock in order to survive . I also have Elinore Randall Stewart 's homestead book . I read it several years ago , I have to reread it , since I just watched the newly - released , remastered DVD of the movie . I tried to buy the video for several years , finally bought it used from a video store that went out of business . But Yippee ! The DVD is now for sale , I purchased it on amazon.com . Not cheap , but well worth it to me . This is a movie I will be watching until the end of my days !
neg	From director Barbet Schroder ( Reversal of Fortune ) , I think I saw a bit of this in my Media Studies class , and I recognised the leading actress , so I tried it , despite the rating by the critics . Basically cool kid Richard Haywood ( Half Nelson 's Ryan Gosling ) and Justin Pendleton ( Bully 's Michael Pitt ) team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them . Investigating the murder is homicide detective Cassie ' The Hyena ' Mayweather ( Sandra Bullock ) with new partner Sam Kennedy ( Ben Chaplin ) , who are pretty baffled by the evidence found on the scene , e.g. non - relating hairs . The plan does n't seem to be completely going well because Cassie and Sam do quite quickly have Richard or Justin as suspects , it is just a question of if they can sway them away . Also starring Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills , Chris Penn as Ray Feathers , R.D. Call as Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst . D.A. Al Swanson . I can see now the same concept as Sir Alfred Hitchcock 's Rope with the murdering for a challenge thing , but this film does it in a very silly way , and not even a reasonably good Bullock can save it from being dull and predictable . Adequate !
pos	In New York , when the shy and lonely project manager of a design firm Matt Saunders ( Luke Wilson ) meets Jenny Johnson ( Uma Thurman ) in the subway , he invites her to date and have dinner with him . Jenny immediately falls in love for him , they have sex and she discloses her true identity to him , telling that she is the powerful superhero G - Girl . After meeting his co - worker and friend Hannah Lewis ( Anna Faris ) , the needy Jenny becomes jealous , controlling and manipulative , and Matt follows the advice of his best friend Vaughn Haige ( Rainn Wilson ) and dumps her , breaking her heart . Jenny turns Matt 's life into hell , while he has a romance with Hannah . However , the archenemy of G - Girl and former high school sweetheart of Jenny , Professor Bedlam ( Eddie Izzard ) , proposes Matt to lure Jenny to strip her superpowers . " My Super Ex - Girlfriend " is delightfully silly and funny . This romantic comedy - adventure has many hilarious moments and is very entertaining . Luke Wilson is great in the role of an idiot , Anna Farris is extremely sexy as usual , and Uma Thurman is great in the role of a deranged neurotic superhero that recalls Glenn Close in " Fatal Attraction " or Evelyn Draper in " Play Misty For Me " . My vote is seven . Title ( Brazil ) : " Minha Super Ex - Namorada " ( " My Super Ex - Girlfriend " )
neg	Redundant , everlasting shots , useless shots , useless scenes are what you will find in this film . In other words , it seemed technically poor to me . The musical bits are amateurishly directed ( no synchronization in the would - be dancing , badly post - synchronized , bad and obvious improvisation of the actors from time to time , etc ) .   The film is long and boring . Eventually , it makes few point and even less sense .   There are some good ideas though . Some of the comic elements are actually efficient , especially the opening scene . However , the film gets worse and worse so that it is completely unbearable and impossible to understand by the end .   The trailer I saw was very dynamic , that is not true for the film . That is to say the discrepancy between the trailer and the actual film is something very close to a rip off .
pos	Although too young to remember the first showing of the series ( being just a baby ) I later caught repeats of it on television in the late 80 's , just when I was getting interested in the war and all of its aspects . It was my grandfather who first showed me the series and also gave me my first interests , relating tales of his time in the Royal Navy at Malta and later in the Pacific . Since then I have devoured many books and seen many television series about the World War Two era , with mixed opinions . The British television stations are generally very good at producing these , as The World At War can easily attest , with many gems made by both the BBC and independent companies . I strongly recommend such titles as " The Nazis - A warning From History " , " Blitz " and the BBC series about Dunkirk . " Britain At War In Colour " , with its companion series " Japan " , " Germany " and " America " are of a very high standard . The World At War is by far the best and , despite its age , never fails to deliver . There will always be new revelations about the war that will keep cropping up that obviously are n't included in the series and of course World War Two took place over such a large canvas that to produce a series with EVERY detail would take more time and money then any other , even if such an undertaking was even possible . What I feel I must say to those who decry that it does not include everything is that The World At War ca n't physically do that as a series but it sure as heck can prompt you to do further research - and make it enjoyable . That certainly worked for me : I now have a very comprehensive library of books , videos , DVDs and tapes and CDs . Recommend to anyone with even a passing interest . The series was so well made that they 'd find it hard not to agree that it is quality programming and highly informative .
neg	Must have to agree with the other reviewer . This has got to be the WORST movie , let alone western I have ever seen . Terrible acting , dialogue that was unimaginative and pathetic ( let alone completely inappropriate for supposedly being in the 1800s ) , and oh , did I mention a battery pack prominently displayed on the back of one of the characters ? I was waiting for the boom mike to fall in the middle of a scene . And the ending ? The least I can say is that it was consistent with the rest of the movie ... completely awful . And yes , it did contain every cliché in the book from the slow walk down the empty dusty road to the laughable " let 's remember when " shots when a main character dies . Luckily I saw this on free TV . Do n't waste your time .
pos	I watched this in July and even with the Christmas theme , found it touching and sensitive . It is not for someone with a reality - mind as it is full of fantasy and lovely moments that sometimes do n't make sense . William Russ did a grand job as Hank . I have only seen him in the remake of The Long , Hot Summer where he played a weak character . But in this one , the expression in his eyes throughout , as Hank considered the things that were happening to him , was wonderful and tender . Valerie Bertinelli was excellent and lovely as usual and very believable in this role . And Peter Falk as Max was splendid and always brought a smile when he appeared in a number of important scenes . There were many special scenes , including the one where Hank realizes who Max really was in his life . It 's not for everyone ..... especially those who are n't into ' feel - good ' movies and this is definitely one ! If you like everything to be perfect and make sense , avoid this one . But I think it is well - worth re - watching , which is why I taped it . ( Yes , some of us still have VCRs . :)
neg	DR . SEUSS ' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS / ( 2000 ) * * ( out of four ) If you desire to see a holiday movie that will inspire your seasonal spirits and continue the traditional Dr. Seuss classic fable , do n't see " Dr. Seuss ' How the Grinch Stole Christmas . " If you are old enough to read this review , then you are probably too old to get any kind of enjoyment out of this motion picture . It contains lots of colors , creative production design and imaginative set and costume construction , joyous load noises , and the characters are made up to look like the actual inhabitants of the fictional village Whoville . Unfortunately that is where the movie 's positive elements end ; the rest of the production is nothing but an excuse for Jim Carrey to cackle on screen while giving a devilish grin , all while prancing through the overly broad screenplay with nothing much to do . Many people recognize the story of how the grinch stole Christmas from Whoville , so I will not waste my time in writing a detailed synopsis for you to read . However , I will say that the movie 's story is executed in three major acts ; the development of the grinch and setting , the Whoville festival , and the Dr. Seuss vision of the mean one robbing the Who 's from their Christmas . There are many familiar names within the credits here , but no familiar faces . Like in " Battlefield Earth , " I just do not see why the producers would hire expensive actors just to have their identities shielded by unrecognizable makeup and costumes . Regardless , there is SNL 's Molly Shannon as Betty Lou , the wife of Bill Irwin , the later playing Lou Lou , the father of little Cindy Lou , played by Taylor Momsen . Jeffrey Tambor is the Whoville mayor , Anthony Hopkins lends his bellowing voice for the film 's narrator , and Christine Baranski is the Grinch 's lone lost lover . The filmmakers attempt to bring originality to the story by adding unnecessary subplots and focusing too much on the little Cindy Lou . The screenplay by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman just feels like it goes everywhere across the movie landscape ; there is little if any focus by director Ron Howard and the screenplay is predictable , too extensive , and contrived . The only character given any distinctions here is the Grinch himself , all of the other characters are puppets of the plot , shapeless and uninteresting . And the dialogue is overzealous and too corny to be anything but pathetic . Example - Grinch : Oh , the Who - manity ! The movie 's redeeming factors go out to the gifted production designer Michael Corenblith , the costume designer Rita Ryack , and the ample makeup department . " How the Grinch Stole Christmas " is a very good - looking production . The sets and the atmosphere created by the filmmakers are detailed and imaginative ; it is like the audience is visiting a world as in a dream . The people of Whoville are plastered with makeup , to the point in which we can not tell the actor reciting the humorless lines . Although dazzling , I really ca n't give credit to the performances , for they are over looked to due the expensive technical department taking their place . Jim Carrey is one actor who I can talk about . His performance is what nearly destroys the movie itself He is way too egotistic as the Grinch , too exaggerated and comical to allow the story to be anywhere near recognizable as the work of Seuss . Surprisingly , although there are a few funny moments due to a few slyly clever sequences , no laughs come from Jim Carry 's zany silliness . It is almost like the movie was wrote specifically for Carry to overplay his part . This factor only leads the movie to a wild but brainless comedy , which is only a pale shadow of the original Christmas classic " How the Grinch Stole Christmas . " After this movie , historians should check the coffin of the late author , Dr. Seuss may have rolled over in his grave .
pos	Q.E.D. was a brilliant TV series and it truly was one of the very few worth scheduling for ! I suspect that in this era of TIVO and recording devices that it would fare much better than it did in 1982 . I am eagerly awaiting its availability on DVD ! While it is true that it has some in common with other television shows like The Wild , Wild West , The Bearcats and The Adventures of Brisco County , Jr. , all of which I am a huge fan of , Q.E.D. had a much more intellectual quality to it . It did not suffer for that , however - the dialog was witty and the action was high . The show ran in the UK as Mastermind , and it did have something of the BBC feel to it , but with better production values than BBC typically had in that era . I was a nineteen year old lad when this series ran initially , and had much too much to do in my life to make time for television . I remember my dear mother , however , calling me to remind me that Q.E.D. was on , and we would sit on the phone and watch it together . Wonderful memories . Truly , Q.E.D. is a sad loss and , if it could be done with the same quality and values today , I would love to see it make a return .
neg	Awful . This thriller should have buried . What a piece of crap . Terrible writing , characters are less than believable . Horrible Schlock ! ! Stick some B- stars in a terribly written POS to try and give it a little credit , but it fails miserably . If I did n't have to write ten lines about this movie I would have given it a word word review , it starts with ' sh ' and ends with ' it ' . Horrible ending , retarded . Who writes this crap . The ending of this film is so contrived , weak it 's as if they had no idea what to do with this story line , or they just ran out of money . Most likely due to the number of cameos in this movie . It 's a good thing that these actors are on the way out , because this would be a career killer . Good thing for them that hardly anyone will see it . At least no one important , like future investors . It could have ended a thousand different ways , but as it is , I feel cheated out of my precious time . Do n't bother with this one , you will feel like you wasted time you can never get back .
pos	Wizards of the Lost Kingdom is a movie about a young prince ( Simon ) who is banished from his kingdom due to his father ( the king ) being killed by the cliche " evil adviser " . This movie 's about Simon 's adventures . The special effects , plot , acting , and generally everything about this movie is BAD . However , it 's so bad that it 's funny . You will keep watching this movie simply because it 's so bad it 's funny , and , like the other reviewer of the movie said , it 's so bad it 's good .
neg	By no means is this movie as bad as ' Perfect Stranger ' , but it just was n't funny . It could n't stick to one type of comedy - it jumped from SNL , to Adam Sandler - esquire , to romantic , to little guy scores big , to slapstick , to ' Loser ' ( the movie ) types of comedies . Although there were some pretty funny slapstick moments ( the fall down the hill ) , no one was very particularly funny or outstanding in any way . ' Schindler 's List ' was funnier ( and felt shorter ) . you never knew if Andy Samberg was supposed to be in high school , a college dropout , or just a loser living at home with his mother - Sissy Spacek , in her worst choice of roles . And poor Ian McShane , THE serious actor if I only had to name one , is given crap to read into the camera . The story drags and is completely predictable up to and including the end ( no spoilers here in case Adam Samberg 's mom wants to see it ) . Do n't spend ANY money going to see this movie , and maybe Lorne Michaels will get the hint and start producing quality ( Yes , Wayne 's World and Tommy Boy are quality ) movies .
pos	It started out slow after an excellent animated intro , as the director had a bunch of characters and school setting to develop . Once the bet is on , though , the movie picks up the pace as it 's a race against time to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten by 7 pm . We had a good opportunity on the way home to discuss some things with our son : bullies , helping others , mind over matter when you do n't want to do something . Of special note is the girl who played Erica ( Erk ) : Hallie Kate Eisenberg . The director kinda sneaks her in unexpectedly , and when she is on - screen she is captivating . She 's one of those " Hey , she looks familiar " faces , and then I remembered that she was the little girl that Pepsi featured about 8 years ago . She was also in " Paulie " , that movie about the parrot who tries to find his way home . Ms. Eisenberg made many TV and movie appearances in ' 99 - 00 , but then was not seen much for the next few years . She 's now 14 and is growing up to be a beautiful woman . Her smile really warms up the screen . If she can get some more good roles she could have as good a career ( or better ? ) than Haley Joel Osment , another three named kid actor , but hopefully without some of the problems that Osment has been in lately . Anywhozitz , according to my 8 y.o . son , who just finished reading the story , the film did not seem to follow the book all that well , but was entertaining none the less . The ending of the film seemed like a big setup for some sequels ( How to Eat Boiled Slugs ? Escargot Kid 's Style ? ) , which might not be such a bad thing . It was nice to take the family to a movie and not have to worry about language , violence or sex scenes . One other good aspect of the movie was the respect / fear engendered by the principal Mr. Burdock ( Boilerplate ) . Movies nowadays tend to show adult authority figures as buffoons . While he has one particular goofy scene , he ruled the school with a firm hand . It was also nice to see Andrea Martin getting some work .
neg	OK now , lets see . What was funny in the first movie ? I know , people with funny accents , people falling into the water , silly boat crashes and funny comments between the two teams . In this movie they have twisted the accent part to the max , no good . A whole a lot of people are falling into the water for uncertain reasons , no good . Boatcrash , check . Funny comments between the two teams , they tried but failed . Also , there are too may personalities they are following in this movie . This film should be about what is happening on the water , not on land . I am sorry to say that there is too far between the funny parts and the sponsors of the film are exploited to the max . No good . All in all , I give it four out of ten since it has some funny parts .
pos	I LOVE the Doodlebops . My son has been watching them for over a year . We went to the Doodlebops concert last year as well as one concert yesterday ( connecticut ) . He LOVES them . The doodlebops do not teach the alphabet or numbers but who cares ? are you being serious ? the TV is n't suppose to teach your children about numbers or the alphabet . the parents should . Get over it . The Doodlebops actually CAN sing . Deedee has a beautiful voice and in concert you can tell all 3 of them have nice singing voices and do NOT lip sing . Imagine , they dance , jump around and STILL sing . they have talent , the kids love them i even enjoy watching the show . This show is by far the best show on TV for kids . AND a rock band for children . How amazing is that ? Why are people saying Chad ( rooney ) is gay ? where did you hear that from ? Whether he is or not , He is awesome ! Leave him alone . Its not like he or anyone else is promoting homosexuality to our children !

pos	Of all the reviews I 've read , most people have been exceedingly hard on Alexandre . Neither Marie or Veronika ever seemed that they would particularly desperate to keep Alexandre , he being only slightly intelligent though not at all intellectual , as most of us are , however hard it may be for anyone to admit . Alexandre is getting away with life perfectly , being totally taken care of , getting and giving what he wants . the girls are allowing this , veronika loves sex , marie is his patron . is there anything wrong with any of this ? is anyone in love ? really ? i do n't think so . Though French New Wave cinema is prone to pretension and so on , it is marvelous simply because of its lack of a need for a plot in order to create emotion . Ease is perfectly lovely and all anyone in Alexandre 's position , in an urban area can ask for . I 'm looking for a patron , anyone interested ?
neg	This is a low budget Roger Corman horror / creature flick . A DinoCroc is created when manipulation of prehistoric genes runs amok . An engineered croc first kills one of its own then gets the taste of human and becomes a fast growing terror after escaping . None of the characters have any depth , but then they are not the focal point . We only get a few glimpses of the huge two - legged dinosaur descendant and some of the best " kill " scenes in a small budget film . My favorite scene is of a moronic character trying to use a three legged dog for bait and becomes croc food himself . Nothing left on the pier but ankle top feet . With no real stand out roles : Jane Longendecker , Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier . Most pathetic is Matt Borlenghi and an obnoxious professional croc hunter Costas Mandylor . I was most impressed with the alluring Joanna Pacula as the respectfully feared Dr. P. DINOCROC is redeeming as a crock of pickles .
pos	I originally saw this movie as a boy at the old Rialto Theatre as part of a Saturday afternoon matinée triple bill which also featured Vincent Price 's " Last Man on Earth " and Mario Bava 's " Nightmare Castle . " I had nightmares about blood lusting ghosts for a week afterwards ! Though I did n't know it then , all three movies would prove to be classics of the genre . No wonder I was so scared ! Though all three films frightened me , it was Castle of Blood that had the most profound impact . It was the first on the bill . I did n't even get to see it from the beginning as we were late getting to the cinema and missed the first 20 minutes of the movie . That 's lot to miss since the edited print only ran about 79 minutes ( the unedited runs 87minutes ) . But despite this , the dark creepy atmosphere ( complete with ruined castles , fog enshrouded cemeteries , shadows and cobwebs ) , Gothic set design , strong acting , and suspense ( especially the last 20 minutes ) scared the bejeepers out of me and made a lasting impression It took me years to finally get a copy of the film for my collection . Since it was a French - Italian import , it was n't a movie that showed up on the late show in Winnipeg . I could n't quite remember the title ( remember I did n't get to seen the beginning of the film and was scared witless ) , and to make matters worse , the film had been released under literally a dozen different movie titles ( aka Danze Macabre , Coffin of Terror , Castle of Terror , Long Night of Terror , etc ... ) and the USA / UK working title " Castle of Blood " was very generic , similar to dozens of other " b " horror and suspense films , making it illusive . But thanks to the internet and perseverance , I found it at last ! What a treat to finally watch the film in its entirety after so many years ! It may not have had quite the sheer emotional impact that it did when I was a boy , but as haunted house movies go , it 's stands up well and compares favourably to similar iconic films of the period such as " The Haunting , " " The Innocents " or " Black Sunday , " The film is a fine early effort of Italian director Antonio Margheriti . It stars 60 's scream queen icon Barbara Steele and features a well written screenplay by Sergio Corbucci about a sceptical writer ( Georges Riviere ) who , on a bet , spends the night in haunted house and unsuspectingly becomes part of an annual ongoing ghostly story . The hypnotic Steele is well cast as the ghostly love interest - as is Arturo Dominici as Dr. Carmus , and Margarete Robsahm as Julia . Many of the tricks Margheriti employs to create the film 's eerie atmosphere ( cobwebs , creaking doors , fog , etc ) are bound to seem cliché to a modern audience , but they work far more effectively in black and white than they ever could in modern day colour . Rather than using body counts and special effects , the film creates scares the old fashion way , relying on a good story , stylish direction , fine set production , interesting camera work , and strong acting performances . Margheriti does a marvellous job taking these elements and building the film 's suspense as the horrifying paranormal secret of the house gradually reveals itself to the unwitting writer . The film is not without faults . The pace drags at the beginning of the film ( ironically , the 20 minutes I originally missed ) . This is probably worsened by Synapse films effort to restore the film to its original length . Though fans will likely appreciate the chance to see the film restored - in terms of the intro - it may have been more of hindrance than a help . The English voice dubs are merely passable and , in the restored scenes , the language shifts from English to French ( English subtitles provided ) which is sure to be annoying to some viewers . However , Synapse Films deserves kudos for the quality of the print . Clearly some effort was put into its restoration and deservedly so . I enjoyed the film immensely and highly recommend it to aficionados of 60 's Italian Goth films , or anyone who enjoys a good ghost story . Rob Rheubottom Winnipeg , MB Canada
neg	I have been learning about the Zodiac for four years now . And I 'm not saying I know much more than anyone else ... in fact out of most of the people who know and read and learn about Z , I am prolly the one with the least knowledge ... But I do know or at least I think I know that most of the stuff in this would n't happen ... From how he signed his name ... to how he killed people ... I thought that Godfather was the worst film ever ... The cinematography was that of a five year old ... not saying that my films are any better but I am not someone who is making movies for the mass population ... The acting I thought for the most part was pretty good really I did ... the lead did n't talk that much on camera or at all I forget and do n't know because I stopped watching ... his voice overs where good ... But really spend the four dollars and 70 cents on something else ... like a large pizza or something ... Until I learn how to write a review , Psycho Phil
pos	Ever wonder where the ideas for romance novels and other paper back released come from ? According to ' Jake Speed ' they are based on real people , living out the adventures they write about and publish . This movie is quality family entertainment , moderate amounts of violence , and skimpy clothes at the worst . The language is is also not a problem , and the jokes are funny at all levels . This is a ' Austin Powers ' look at ' Indian Jones ' , without the over - the - top antics of Michael Myers . I highly recommend this film for kids in the 10 to 15 range .
neg	Ulises is a literature teacher that arrives to a coastal town . There , he will fell in love to Martina , the most beautiful girl in town . They will start a torrid romance which will end in the tragic death of Ulises at the sea . Some years later , Martina has married to Sierra , the richest man in town and lives a quiet happy live surrounded by money . One day , the apparition of Ulises will make her passion to rise up and act without thinking the consequences . The plot is quite absurd and none of the actors plays a decent part . IN addition , three quarters of the film are sexual acts , which , still being well filmed , are quite tiring , as we want to see More development of the story . It is just a bad Bigas Luna 's film , with lots of sex , no argument and stupid characters everywhere .
pos	I first saw this movie back in the early ' 90 's when it was first released . Room With a View was also newly out . Enchanted April had so much more to offer ! I found it much more real and earthy , the characters more believable for being ' normal ' . By the end of the film I felt the same as I did when I first saw the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice , I was yearning for the characters to find what they were looking for whether it was isolation , peace , liberty or love . You get a sense throughout that Italy is so far removed from everything they have ever known , that they are so decadent for taking a risk and leaving behind all that is humdrum and constricting . But in the heat of the spring in April , everyone 's lives loosen and unravel ( in line with the Victorian corsets ) and are slowly rebuilt to everyone 's satisfaction . What a little gem of a film ! How come it is n't more well known ?
neg	The documentary revolves around Eva Mozes Kor , a holocaust survivor , part of Mengele 's experiments on twins , consisting primarily her version of what happened at Auschwitz , and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of the twin experiments . The movie obviously had great reviews . It 's one of those topics that no one dares to voice a contrary opinion about . I too , for a large part of the movie , got sucked into the emotion that the movie - maker so obviously wanted the viewer to concentrate on . One of the user reviews on IMDb by Eric Monder ( obviously having nothing critical to say about the issue on a public forum ) could only find the sweetest nectar . " In one of the many dramatic sequences , as a group of Jews argue with Kor at a Jewish center , the meaning of the word " forgive " is even debated , but the isolated and outnumbered Kor holds her own " But by this time , the sappy hold that the movie had on my dormant emotional repertoire had let loose enough that I could see clearly once more . After the " strong - willed " Eva Kor forgives her " Nazi captors " the movie begins to delve into what forgiving is all about , at least from the viewpoint of Kor . The movie goes about following her , past her public statement forgiving the Nazis and into new territory . To me , this was the meat of the movie , surrounded by inedible fat of her " act of forgiveness " . Obviously , it was a very sick cow . On a mission to test her theory of forgiveness , in order to heal wounds of the past , she makes her way to the " promised land " to meet with some Arabs , to discuss with them the issues that they face and to see if dialogue can not lead to a better understanding of the situation and heavily interspersed with debates and discussions with Jews in the US on her act of forgiving the Nazis , including one at a Jewish center in Chicago . From then on , anyone not so teary eyed that they ca n't see the screen will find it hard - pressed to miss the obvious contradiction in her statements . Firstly , you immediately notice her body language , defensive and unwilling to listen in a room full of Arab scholars and teachers . Her comments about how she feared that they might kidnap her shows how much of a waste of time , effort and money the entire act was . A rather annoyed Dr Sami Advan ( Professor of education at Bethlehem University ) gets it just right when he tells Kor off for a statement she makes about how she would rather be asleep in her apartment . Finally , the debate at the Jewish center in Chicago , where she is " grilled " on the meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so , in the wake of those that continue suffering through the trauma of the acts . I will cut to the chase . By the end of the movie , I was hoping I had n't chosen to watch the movie . The movie was badly made , failing to delve deeper into anything about Auschwitz apart from the purely trivial , just sufficient to make sure the holocaust is refreshed in the viewers memory and to incite a barrage of tears . It showed that Kor , the subject of the documentary was unable to engage in fair discussion . Her discussion abilities were limited to parroting her stance on forgiveness ( at best ) to a complete unwillingness to listen or participate . Lastly , is everyone so retarded today that they ca n't notice the difference between making peace and forgiving ? Quoting another IMDb user , " I do n't see her forgiveness as being weak- quite the contrary , she just wanted to relieve its hold from her soul , she wanted the suffering to be over , so she let it go . " That would be the perfect layman 's definition of MAKING PEACE . I guess , in a world of propaganda , blind faith and political correctness , there is no room to question those that have " gone through more than the human mind can fathom " . P.S. The dictionary certainly should go into all those Books - to - buy lists everyone keeps making .
pos	Yes , Giorgio , is a feel good movie . A little romance , great music , beautiful scenery , comedy , ( a great food fight ) , and a little taste of bittersweet are the ingredients of Yes , Giorgio . Any movie buff would enjoy this film . Those who require massive special effects , should look elsewhere . Most of us need a little escape now and then , and how better to do this , than with a feast for the eyes , ears , and heart ? A must see !
neg	There is not a speck of entertainment in this entire film . There 's not one scary , funny , or even interesting scene in this film . It advertises itself as a horror , then goes on to call itself a comedy . It does n't even ATTEMPT humor . Neither does it attempt to be scary . In order to not be bored by this film , you would have to be one of the most easily entertained people on earth . If you like this movie even a LITTLE BIT than you have no standard for what you watch at all . I 'm having a very difficult time trying to understand what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with this . Its not funny , scary , shocking , or intriguing . So was it supposed to be a drama ? Because it really was n't dramatic either . Please just do yourself a favor and do n't watch this film . Life is too precious to be wasting 90 minutes of it watching this .
pos	Okay , the recent history of Star Trek has not been good . The Next Generation faded in its last few seasons , DS9 boldly stayed where no one had stayed before , and Voyager started very bad and never really lived up to its promise . So , when they announced a new Star Trek series , I did not have high expectations . And , the first episode , Broken Bow , did have some problems . But , overall it was solid Trek material and a good romp . I 'll get the nits out of the way first . The opening theme is dull and I do n't look forward to sitting through it regularly , but that 's what remotes are for . What was really bad was the completely gratuitous lotion rubbing scene that just about drove my wife out of the room . They need to cut that nonsense out . But , the plot was strong and moved along well . The characters , though still new , seem to be well rounded and not always what you would expect . The Vulcans are clearly being presented very differently than before , with a slightly ominous theme . I particularly liked the linguist , who is the first Star Trek character to not be able to stand proud in the face of death , but rather has to deal with her phobias and fears . They seemed to stay true to Trek lore , something that has been a significant problem in past series , though they have plenty of time to bring us things like shooting through shields , the instant invention of technology that can fix anything , and the inevitable plethora of time - travel stories . Anyone want to start a pool on how long before the Borg show up ? All in all , the series has enormous potential . They are seeing the universe with fresh eyes . We have the chance to learn how things got the way they were in the later series . How did the Klingons go from just insulting to war ? How did we meet the Romulans ? How did the Federation form and just who put Earth in charge . Why is the prime directive so important ? If they address these things rather than spitting out time travel episodes , this will be an interesting series . My favorite line : Zephram Cochran saying " where no man has gone before " ( not " no one " )
neg	Creep is the story of Kate ( Potente ) , an intensely unlikeable bourgeois bitch that finds herself somehow sleeping through the noise of the last underground train , and waking up to find herself locked in the tube station . After somehow meeting workmate and would - be rapist Guy on a mystery train that runs after the lines have closed , things go awry and she finds herself pursued by what lurks beneath the city 's streets . Her story is linked to that of George ( Blackwood ) , an ex - con working in the sewer system ; they meet in the final third of the film , brought together by their attempts to escape the monster that pursues them . The pair proceed through a set of increasingly unlikely locations ; from the Tube station , they end up in the sewage works before somehow finding themselves in some sort of abandoned underground surgery . Most Tube stations do n't have toilets , so how one has a surgery is beyond me . Naturally , the film cares to explain that the surgery does n't have running water . Yet it has electricity ? Just one of many inconsistencies that work against the atmosphere of everyday believability that the film tries to create . The monster itself is a problem . There 's a complete lack of reasoning for its actions , it just kills people for no obvious reason . And then of course it keeps some alive for no real reason either , perhaps just so that they can eventually escape and give the film an extra 15 minutes or so running time . I understand that natural evil is supposed to be scary , but then the film attempts to explain itself via a photo of a doctor and his son , and a few shots of some jars containing babies , and yes , it is just as tired and pathetic as it sounds . It also fails to explain how the creature has been underground long enough to lose the ability to speak , communicating only in raptor screams , but not long enough for its pair of shorts to decay . Hmm . This doctor business leads to scene that is the film 's desperate attempt to implant itself on your memory , and while it is gory and uncomfortable to watch , it just is n't enough . The final third of the film hinges on an emotional relationship that never existed , and the characters break down and recover for little or no obvious reason . George breaks down , unable to cope with something despite stating that he wants to escape so he can see his daughter again , and Kate becomes emotionally tough seconds after going to pieces over someone that ripped her off for a travelcard . Yeah . After starting out as a " this could happen to anyone " movie , it quickly falls apart as it introduces ideas that make it more and more unrealistic . A complete lack of emotional interest in the characters and an absence of suspense make this one to avoid .
pos	After all these years , of Peter O'Tool 's brilliant , costly giving of his Soul , film after film , at last , Hollywood tosses him an Oscar recently . Country Dance showed up one night late , and of course , blew me out of my complainant niche in my alleged " Life " . How does he do it ? York again also is brilliant in this kind of play . Both psychological battleships loaded for bear .... Bravo to author , director , cast , and camera crew . No wonder the Nazi 's lost to these Irish , Scot , English blends .... brutal honesty hurts ... back in the 70 's , when I personally believed " honesty " was pure and absolutely vital to trust . I have modified my edgy extremes , and will settle for more human , warm flaws within myself and others . Forgiveness allows humanity to have a reverse gear , and allows us to fix our own bull headed egos and erotic mistakes ....
neg	I was attracted to seeing this movie because of this plot and my desire to watch a horror . To my disappointment , this turned into more of a comedy than a horror . The acting , dialog , and flow of the movie was all very poorly done . Much of it did n't make sense . For example , there 's a party of about 30 people and they 're all terrified of one person despite them being at a secret location and are all healthy looking young adults and the guy threatening them sounds haggard . I kept thinking , maybe this was a parody of another movie like Scary Movie , but they were trying too hard to make it look gruesome - emphasis on try . The blood and gore are also poorly done . I 've seen Halloween costumes look more believable than this . A guy with his head cut clean off ... looked clean - missing signs bone , flesh , blood , and even the head . A strong downward strike with an ax on a corpse should lodge itself into something ... seemed like the guy was swinging a bat instead of an ax . Revealing who the main villain was supposed to be a twist , but contradicted other parts in the story . What was going in the guy 's mind to turn out like that ? If there was going to be a twist , you should at least build up to it adding mystery and suspense .

neg	You can give JMS and the boys a pass on this one because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget , but the movie is still sub - par . Do nt get me wrong , B5 the series is by far the best TV series ever , but if i was an exec seeing this movie , i would nt have ordered the series . I do nt like O'Hare as an actor , the costumes are silly , and there are tons of cliches . The same can be said for most of the first season ( with the exception of Babylon Squared and Survivors ) ; Bruce immediately put a fire into the series and it went on to be an amazing spectacle . If you are a B5 fan and have nt seen this movie , see it . If you are nt a B5 fan , dont ... you wo nt want to watch the series .
pos	The fluttering of butterfly wings in the Atlantic can unleash a hurricane in the Pacific . According to this theory ( somehow related to the Chaos Theory , I 'm not sure exactly how ) , every action , no matter how small or insignificant , will start a chain reaction that can lead to big events . This small jewel of a film shows us a series of seemingly - unrelated characters , most of them in Paris , whose actions will affect each others ' lives . ( The six - degrees - of - separation theory can be applied as well . ) Each story is a facet of the jewel that is this film . The acting is finely - tuned and nuanced ( Audrey Tautou is luminous ) , the stories mesh plausibly , the humor is just right , and the viewer leaves the theatre nodding in agreement .
neg	The Ladies Man is a funny movie . There 's not much thought behind it , but what do you expect from an SNL movie ? It 's actually better than most SNL movies ( i.e. Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury ) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both very funny . Chris Parnell was also funny in his short scene ( one of the funnier ones in the movie ) . Other than that , the rest of the cast is average and is just there to support Meadows . I 've definitely seen funnier movies , but I 've seen dumber ones too . Again , it 's not exactly a deep movie , but it 's good for a few laughs . It was funnier as a skit though . But still , if you 're looking for a pretty funny movie , I 'd recommend this one . Just do n't think about it too much , or you 'll hate it . Rating : 6/10
pos	I thoroughly enjoyed this film overall , but four things really stand out : Sam Raimi 's perfect comic timing and performance as the camp handy(?)man , Alan Arkin 's wonderful characterisation of the camp owner , and best of all , the cinematography . The beautiful golden tones of the exterior scenes draws me into the film like a sunset at the lakeshore draws me into my own summer memories . The dialog and mood feel very natural and believable . Some reviewers criticise the lack of a more " profound " script . To me , it is exactly that lack that makes this film work . The characters and their problems seem real and because of that , I care about what happens to them . The bottom line is that all the parts come together to create a whole that feels right .
neg	This Italian film from the ' 70 's is NOT even in the class with Dog Soldiers , The Howling , or even that awful American Werewolf in Paris , BUT ... it is fun to watch . I 'm talking about watching the lead actress , a stunning blonde , run amok in her birthday suit . We 're talking about graphic , complete nudity ... it 's obvious that she is a real blonde ... humma humma humma ! ! The story is a hoot , the SFX are childish , and the acting ( for the most part ) stinks . The only redeeming value of this movie is all ( and there is a LOT ) the nudity & sex scenes . Tame by HBO standards , but still fun to see when you find yourself without a date on Saturday night . OK ... HERE 'S THE SPOILER ... There is NO werewolf ( except in the opening scene of the heroine ( ? ? ) 's ancestor . The girl just imagines that she 's a werewolf ... in other words , a clinical Lycanthrope .
pos	OK , I overrated it just a bit to offset at least one of those grumpy reviews . But I did enjoy it . I did n't laugh out loud , but it held my interest and pulled me along without dropping me at any point . The story built . Yeah , you knew it would have an happy ending -- this genre always does . Meantime , it was quirky with sight gags you could miss , so pay attention when you watch . Stiller and Black delivered expertly yet again . Good team . They should work together more . Do n't know that it will be a cult classic , but it was certainly a fun ride . Not as good as WHAT ABOUT BOB , or DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS but what is ? It is still worth going out of your way a little to get and watch this movie .
neg	I 'm a fan of arty movies , but regretfully I have to report this movie to be pretentious drivel . Agonisingly slow to develop a non - existent plot based on a promising premise , the experience is , shall we say , trying . Even after bad movies I feel that I learn something , or enjoyed some aspect , but there there was nothing to appreciate . The premise was not uninteresting , but the movie starts and ends there . The acting was OK , though the characters were utterly boring . For the protagonist to aim at such an audacious goal , she is mightily empty . Pity . I usually enjoy movies that are unformulaic , but lack of formula should not be confused with zero content .
pos	Looking at some of the negative posts , you really have to wonder what some people do for fun .... I was lucky enough to see the film during its all - too - brief theatrical run . The audience laughed its heads off . I 'm watching a tape of it as I type and it 's still dang funny ! It 's also got a sweet side , with unexpected turns of genuine pathos . The late , great Royal Dano is especially effective as the lonely , down - on - his - luck farmer Wrenchmuller . Ariana Richards and J.J. Anderson are great as the lead kids . And the actors in the Martian suits , although limited to mime , do a great job Another thing to look for is the background details . The film is full of homages , pastiches , and references to other SF and fantasy films . Take a look at the Martian costumes next time . One of them is wearing a Marty McFly costume , another is a Ghostbuster , a third is in a House Atreides uniform , and a fourth is wearing a Last Starfighter flightsuit .
neg	I shall not waste my time writing anything much further about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad . That has been done in great detail already , many times over . The ' plot ' started out as a very uninspiring cockney wide - boy / gangster - by - numbers bore and very quickly descended into an utter shambles . Anybody who pretends that they can see some hidden masterpiece inside this awful mess is just kidding themselves . It is now 7 or 8 years since I watched it during its 1 week run at the cinema before it was pulled , yet it sticks in my mind for being easily the most terrible film I have ever seen . I am only making these comments , and indeed the only reason I went to see the film , is because of the amusing fact that my brother Eddie appeared in it as the second ' heavy ' in the pub scene . It was his hands that thrust a zippo lighter towards Rhys Ifan 's face in the bar in ' Russia ' ( it was actually filmed at the former Butlins holiday camp at Barry Island ) . My brother has absolutely no acting experience whatsoever - he had recently joined an extras ' agency and this was his first part . Having seen the film , it appeared that nobody in it required any acting experience whatsoever . I remember there were about 8 people in the whole cinema - and this was just a couple of days after it had been released . I have never heard of an other film that was so unpopular and disappeared so fast - and rightly so . In case you were thinking of renting this film on DVD , I would advise you instead to put your two pound coins in a fire until they are red - hot , then jam them into your eye sockets . This will probably be a lot less painful than watching the film .
pos	I think this still is the best routine . There are some others , like Rock 's " bring the pain " , and Allen 's " Men are Pigs " that are hilarious ; " Damon Waynes last stand " is also funny in a tearful way - but this routine has no errors . All the jokes are funny , and the time limit of 70 minutes is perfect . Just long enough to last 20 years . I just love how he allows the audience to be totally themselves and unrestricted . I 'm a fan of the classics and for a guy who watched a lot of of Jim Carrey growing up , watching a more laid back comic is pretty cool . Not putting in a category with Ellen and Newhart , but something you can watch if you 're bloated . Thanks Eddie , god bless .
neg	Recap : Doctor Markov has developed a new theory how to produce energy , knowledge that might unbalance the world . He keeps his knowledge coded and secret and desperately wants out of the Soviet Union . KGB on the other side desperately wants the new technology . So , they sets a scheme in motion . During a rescue attempt to free Markov , KGB steps in , takes Markov to a secret location and lures him to reveal his secret by saying they are in Sweden , and working for the UN . As a backup , KGB kidnaps Markov 's estranged daughter . CIA now send their best agents , a team of ( Swedish ? ) Ninjas to thwart KGB and rescue Markov and his daughter . Comments : A cult movie that despite not being very good needs seeing . The movie is quite ambitious but lacking in many areas . First off is that it is very dark , probably to conceal locations and bad effects , that some scenes are hard to comprehend . You ca n't see what is happening . The second thing that it is lacking is martial arts , despite being a ninja - movie . Sure there are some , of quite poor quality , but mostly the ninjas fires automatic guns or sets of explosions . The automatic guns pose a problem too as they seem to have a endless supply of ammunition . And the ninjas seem almost immune to bullets while Soviet guards die like flies . What does it have that speaks for it then ? The idea and ambition foremost . Some actually , and especially for a Swedish movie , decent action - scenes albeit not of martial arts . Some nice slow - motion scenes and pretty much blood and gore . And some very interesting new weapons technology that makes the victims heart or brain explode . Mostly all parts that you look for in a B - movie . Because it definitely is a B - movie , no mistake could be made there . But if you expect it , and watch it like a B - movie , it is entertaining . But do n't forget , it is not only a B - movie it is set in the eighties . Some girls , for example , besides wearing ... lets say " interesting " clothes , have lethal doses of eye shadow and makeup . In all , see for the cult status and the ambition . Enjoy it , and then forget it . 4/10
pos	Until today I had never seen this film . Its was filmed on the sets of the Old Dark House and Frankenstein and concerns a small Bavarian village where supposedly giant bats are sucking the blood of the villagers . Frankly its a damn good movie that has atmosphere to spare and a cast that wo n't quit , Lionel Atwill , Dwight Frye , Faye Wray and Melvin Douglas playing a character named Brettschnieder which is of interest to me since that was my great grandmother 's maiden name . This is a carefully modulated film that has suspense and witty one liners that slowly builds for its brief running time , only going astray when about ten minutes before the end they realized they had limited time to wrap everything up . From that point to the end its a straight run to the finish with very little of the fun that preceded it . Leonard Maltin and IMDb list a running time of 71 minutes and warn of shorter prints . The trouble is that IMDb and Maltin can be wrong , and in this case I think they are since a source I trust more says the full running time is 67 minutes ( The Overlook Film Encyclopedia ) Quibbling about this I know is insane but since most prints that are available tend to run around 60 - 63 minutes the amount of missing material is considerably less if its only 67 minutes long . Personally I think it wo n't matter that much since its at most five minutes and I doubt very much it will make or break the film . What ever the running time , if you like creaky old films , do , by all means do , watch this movie , its a great dark and stormy night film .
neg	My husband is a huge Robin Williams fan . I like him too , but have generally found that he should " stick to what he does best " and focus on comedic roles . My thoughts were confirmed with this movie . I was completely bored throughout the entire film . The story was predictable . I realize it was inspired by a true story . But , my guess is that there could have been some suspense or intrigue even while maintaining truth in the story . None of the characters were well developed . There was a side story about the main character and his partner . This relationship could have been explored further . More important , though , would have been a deeper exploration of the mother of the " boy " . Her psychological profile would have been interesting to delve into . She obviously has a long history that was not touched upon except in the most superficial way . If my husband was n't such a huge Williams fan , we would have left 20 minutes into it . Too bad I ca n't get my $ 20 or 2 hours back .
pos	I saw this movie , and the play , and I have to add that this was the most touching story that I had ever seen . Until I saw this movie I was unaware of how awful life was and probably still is for the South African children and adults that were and are living in that era . It brought tears to my eyes and much sadness to my heart that any human being should have to struggle like that just to stay alive , And to bring the children right out of that area and teach them to act and preform and turn them loose to tell their own story is simply amazing . This simply surpass a five star , I rate it a ten . Thank You Mr. Mbongeni Ngema for such a astonishing story . Although it has been 12 years since this story has been told , it is still one that lays heavy in my heart . If there is a VHS , or DVD out there on the play , Please notify me ASAP.Thank You . PS There was nothing wrong with the kids wanting to bring awareness of their problems and conditions to the attention of other countries in hopes that some one would have a heart and offer assistance .
neg	They made me watch this in school and it was terrible . The movie is outdated . The episodes become confusing because fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting . The teachers talked about it as a treat but really it was a painfully boring experience . I have read that very few people who appear in this are actors , but most of them them do what they do in the movie in real life . This accounts for cheesy acting very often . Also , very often the story becomes mildly outrageous and far - fetched . I do n't like the way some of the lines were written and wish they had more meaning to them . Though , it was written to be educational , funny , suspenseful , and hip , It ended up being boring , dry , far - fetched , and old . I hope no one takes time to watch this movie because you would be just fine not seeing it .
pos	I saw this movie when it first came out . It was an official selection for the Temecula Valley International Film Festival and I voted for it for best picture . Justine Priestley is hot as the psychotic , but complex Amanda . This is not your ordinary psycho movie . Lots of interesting and original slants on the genre . Sort of a " Fatal Attraction " for the younger set with some great blues music mixed in as the object of Amanda 's affection is married to an up and coming blues singer who has less time for her husband as her career takes off .
neg	What a crappy movie ! The worst of the worst ! This movie is as entertaining as a dead slug . No - talent - what - so - ever - actors , stupid plot . Who wrote this script ? ! Was there ever a script for this goofy movie or did the director just accidentally press the record - button on his camera and then decided to make the film up as they went along ? Is this meant to be a kids movie or a comedy or what ? My friends younger brother is in the 6.th grade and him and his classmates just did an amateur - movie for their school - project which outdid this geeky movie .. This is by far the worst film I have seen in my life ! There is just no excuse for this flick !
pos	Richard Linklater 's beautifully directed mixture of youthful romance and Paris travelogue is one of the 90 's best thinking person 's romantic movies . Julie Delpy turns in one of the decade 's most engaging performances as the Parisian lass who spends a day with stranger - on - a - train Ethan Hawke . The dialogue ( and there is oodles of it ) is sometimes meandering and overly precious , but this portrait of two young wannabe - lovers making a romantic , intellectual , and spiritual connection to one another is full of wonderfully amusing , touching and insightful moments .
neg	Watching CBS 's " Surrender , Dorothy " , I kept wondering why Diane Keaton would want to be in it ( not because it 's a television movie -- with the dearth of enticing roles for slightly older actresses , it is n't any wonder why Academy Award winning performers such as Keaton turn to TV -- but because it offers no opportunities for Keaton to shine ) . A single mother , grieving the sudden death of her twenty - something daughter , imposes upon -- and gradually becomes friends with -- the group of young people her daughter was close to at the time of her accident . Adapted from the novel , this teleplay gives us a group of self - absorbed characters one would cross the street to avoid . Aside from being coarse and dim , these phony people are incredibly unconvincing , as is the tidy scenario and the bungalow near the beach where the kids reside ( one young man , who wears muscle shirts to tell us he 's gay , hears Diane Keaton say , " Surrender , Dorothy " and actually asks , " That 's from " The Wizard of Oz " , right?" ... no , genius , it 's from " Citizen Kane " ! ) . Keaton may have wanted to do this material based on the subject matter of confronting death . She tries turning this distinctly unlikable woman into a shadow of her own personage ( lots of kooky outfits ) , but it does n't sit well with the viewer since Keaton has always been warmly likable and flexible in a flaky way . Here , she 's a crazed harpy who does n't learn many lessons on her journey of self - discovery ( the movie quickly forgets it 's about a dead young woman and becomes an odyssey for the nervous wreck of a mom , who appears to be an overage hippie who has never lost anyone close to her ) . This is the kind of film actors promote on talk shows with the caveat , " It should help a lot of grieving mothers out there " . I ca n't imagine it helping anyone since it is intrinsically a downer , muddled and baffling . It 's deranged .
pos	This movie tells an amazing story with history and compassion . From the careful descriptions of the crime scenes to the mental health of the lead investigator , you 'll be entranced . It 's an absolute must - see for anyone interested in criminology . Interpol relations and how the agencies work together are also great . Not overly done either . I recommend it for anyone interested in Russian history , too . How the police work with the political party being what it was ... It is truly fascinating and frustrating . The settings are beautiful . It 's been a while since I saw this movie the first time . It does n't diminish it 's impact . Not overly dramatic or graphic , it leaves enough to the imagination , well , you 'll see .
neg	Wenders was great with Million $ Hotel . I do n't know how he came up with this film ! The idea of giving the situation after spt11 and the view of American Society is hopeful , that makes it 2 out of ten . But this is not a movie . Is that the best someone can do with a great idea(the west - east clash).There are important things going on in middle east and it is just issued on the screen of a MAC * with the fingers of an Amerian girl who is actually at the level of stupidity(because she is just ignorant about the facts).The characters are not well shaped . And the most important thing is the idea that is given with religion is somehow funny to me . At the ending scene Lana says lets just be quiet and try to listen . And the background music says " ... I will pray".The thing is not about religion actually . But it ends up with this . How you are gon na see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray . The lights are already shining on the truth . Its just that nobody wants to see it . ps : " My home is not a place . It is people"The only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is that sentence . But it is wasted behind this film making . ( by the way ; as " someone " mentioned below , Americas finest young man are not finest , they are just the " poor " and the " hopeless " ones who sign up for the army in need of good paychecks which is not provided by the government ! )
pos	Kalifornia came out in 1993 , just as 3 of the 4 lead characters were up and coming to the levels of fame they now possess in 2006 . This is a nice psycho - thriller that should appeal to all David Duchovny fans because of his dry and intelligent narratives that find their ways into his work , like with most of his episodes of the X - Files , Playing God , and Red Shoe Diaries . People who were put off by the heavy southern accent from Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis ' characters obviously have never spent much time in the south . For every " Brian and Carrie " in the south , there is an " Adele and Early " and in 2006 , that 's the real horror of this flick . Aside from that , I think the film was written with a cult film intention - like with Carrie 's photography , it 's not suitable for mass consumption . But if you have a copy of this in your personal library , I think it says something positive about your tastes for freaky movies .
neg	The first 30 minutes of Tinseltown had my finger teetering on the remote , poised to flick around to watch something else . The premise of two writers , down on their luck , living in a self - storage - space " bin " was mildly amusing , but , painfully bland . The introduction of the character , played by Joe Pantoliano - the big deal movie guy , that lives in the park and sleeps in a lavatory , offered hope and I decided to give it a few more minutes . And then a few more until Kristy Swansons introduction as a budding film director & borderline nymphomaniac , added a bit of spice . Her solid acting performance raised her presence above and beyond just a very welcome eye - candy inclusion . Ultimately , the obvious low - budget impacts on the film with poorly shot scenes , stuttured pace and slapstick handling of certain moments . Some of my favourite movies of all time have been low budget , Whithnail & I being one that also deals with 2 guys with a dream , but down on their luck . However , for my money , the actors save Tinseltown from the " Terrible movie " archives and just about nudges it into the " could have been a cult movie " archives . I laughed out loud at some of the scenes involving Joe Pantoliano 's character . In particular , the penultimate scenes in the terribly clichéd , but still funny , rich - but - screwed - up characters house , where the story unravels towards it 's final moments . I can see how Tinseltown was a great stage play and while the film - makers did their best to translate this to celluloid , it simply did n't work and while I laughed out loud at some of scenes and one liners , I think the first 30 minutes dulled my senses and expectations to such a degree I would have laughed at anything . Unless you 're stuck for a novelty coffee coaster , do n't pick this up if you see it in a bargain bucket .
pos	It 's a good movie maybe I like it because it was filmed here in PR . The actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome ! The guy is cute too so it 's a good match if you want to the guy or the girls .
neg	This movie which was released directly on video should carry a warning label that it is dangerous to human health and may subject the viewer to terminal boredom . It is yet another thinly veiled , evangalizing " rapture " religious movie with the good guys ( the believers ) suddenly vanishing and the bad guys ( the non - believers)left behind . It 's an interesting concept , especially since we see it happen on a flight captained by a non - believer who is having a sinful affair with a stewardess aboard ( needless to say that sinner does n't disappear either ! ) . Unhappily , with all the pilots being non - believers , the plane did not crash or the movie would have been mercifully over . Though this could have be interesting without the heavy religious browbeating , as a whole the plodding movie makes one gag , the acting is horrible and the obviously computer - generated simulations are very fake looking . Plus it 's yet another movie shot in Canada that purports to be New York City . Spare me ... I'll just read the Bible .
pos	I stumbled upon this movie on cable and was totally hooked . The story of a group of surfers who ride the big waves , waves that are monstrously huge , waves that would make any rational person run away in terror is a one that manages to be spectacular and make you understand why people spend their lives chasing waves . There is nothing special about the film , other than it brings together some very interesting people who are are in love with what they do and lets them talk . Sure there are scenes of them surfing , but what makes this movie so special is the people . Here are a bunch of guys who are so enthusiastic about what they do that it crosses over to the people watching . Half way into this movie you 'll want to go off and learn to surf as well . Few documentaries have ever managed to covey the passion that these people have and its the films ability to make us feel it that makes this a great film . See it .
neg	There was nothing of value in the original movie , this one was even lamer . The fact that I even found it to rent was absolutely amazing . Anyone connected to this film has to be high on something ! So what was the story line ? What was with the girl ? Was the viewer supposed to get the story line in the first four minutes of the film . Sadly , I tried several times to watch this . I even borrowed a kid from someone to get some feedback . Kid said it was stupid , and he was four years old . I find that possibly some credit could go to the filming director , as possibly some of the shots made the movie more than a B film . That might be pushing it . I did love the theme song . Good thing it was only a dollar , it was worth it . I suppose you might enjoy the film if you were high as the cast and crew would have to be . Is pot legal in France ?
pos	I 'm really surprised this movie did n't get a higher rating on IMDB . It 's one of those movies that could easily get by someone , but for romantic comedy " Moonstruck " is really in a class by itself . It 's setting and ethnic charm are things people seem to take for granted . The casting alone makes it a nearly perfect movie . Few movies in the 1980 's were as good as " Moonstruck"and it 's funny too . * * * * out of * * * * *
neg	Wow , what can I say about this film ? It 's a lousy piece of crap . I 'm surprised that it got rated as high as it did . What 's wrong with this film ? Here 's a better question : What 's NOT wrong with this film . The story itself is just crap and cliché . Here 's pretty much what it 's about ... Some kinda nerdy kid with no friends gets picked on , gets killed , and comes back as a scarecrow for revenge . " All " of that is packed into 86 minutes of worthless film . If you have n't seen this movie do n't waste your time watching it . Also , the second one is n't much better , so do n't bother watching that either ... I rated this movie a three because I liked the scarecrow 's outfit , not because there was anything good about the movie . I think you get the picture .
pos	This great film is composed mostly of documentary footage is currently contained on a DVD along with Prelude to War . The great American filmmaker and story teller Frank Capra made these films which simply and clearly call attention to the main points that caused World War II and Hitler 's rise . Every school child , nay , every American should watch these films today because they are so apropos . History has been repeating itself over and over again ! The Lord Chamberlains are still alive and kicking ; the tactics used by the Nazis of infiltrating countries through sympathizers and then the Communists and now by Muslim terrorist groups , are still working to these evil group 's advantage . By sitting back and letting Hitler as early as 1935 be aggressive - France , America and England caused over 50 million people 's deaths . Americans , French and British today would happily let Hitler do exactly the same thing despite the fact that we should have learned from history what happens when you let dictators break treaties . These great films may be too simplistic for World War II history buffs . They do n't tell the horrors that the Soviet Union caused simply because at the time America was teamed up with them , fighting Hitler . This film does tell the plain facts and motives that led to the terrible war .
neg	There 's enough star power in THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS to create another galaxy , yet the final product is pretty debatable . The film and its messages are very noble , and I think perhaps most would agree with them . ( Liberal Democracy good , violent fascist regime bad ; open - mindedness good , racism bad , etc ) . Unfortunately , we 're battered from head to toe with these , and as much subtlety is used as I 've described them .   Ultimately , we are left watching very noble people without any flaws squaring off with nasty cretins who have no redeeming qualities . It radiates with all the suspense of a badly orchestrated " pro " wrestling match . Jeremy Irons plays the patron , a man of many contradictions . Meryl Streep as his gifted bride and Glenn Close , as her sister in law . When the camera stays with these folks , the movie tends to move , and is quite enjoyable . Unfortunately , THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS engages with simply way too many subplots , and characters pop up and out of the picture like shooting gallery targets . We do n't get to know them , hence we do n't get to care for them . The result is boredom .   If Bille August , the director and screenwriter ( from Isabel Allende 's book ) had either lengthened the film or snipped a few characters , this film might have worked completely . As it stands , it was a nice try , with nice messages , and a bonecrushing yawnfest . Not recommended .
pos	Fortunately for us Real McCoy fans ( most likely all Baby Boomers who grew - up in the late 50 's and 60 's ) , three of the adult actors / actress appeared when they did for the reunion show , in 2000 . Tony Martinez and Richard Crenna both died shortly thereafter . As enjoyable as it was to see Luke , Sugar - Babe , and Pepino together again , it was equally mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of Lydia Reed and Michael Winkleman ? It is my understanding that Little Luke had passed away in 1999 , but I 'm not sure how . There is no information about Hassie on the internet , that I can find . Very curious why they were not even mentioned ? It was so conspicuous , their absence from the Reunion show , that I suspect that the family of Michael and Lydia herself ( if still alive ) either , 1 ) requested to be left out of the discussion and therefore their desire was granted , or 2 ) TNN could not find any trace of either Michael or Lydia ( like the rest of us ) , they seemed to have vanished . Therefore , it would be the safest policy to leave them out of the conversation all together . Otherwise , the retrospect on Walter Brennen was wonderfully done . They made no bones about it ... it was Grandpa who made the show such a success . I remember , as a child , mimicking Grandpa 's gimp walk and my parents laughing ( as I 'm sure a million other children did back then ) . One annoyance that did bother me a bit , was the tendency for Richard Crenna to dominate the discussion ... at times interrupting Tony and Kathleen to make a point . In fact , although Tony Martinez seemed completely capable to contribute to the conversation , he was not allowed to speak - out and say too much during the Reunion show . Unfortunate , since I wanted to hear from all three , equally . All in all , the Reunion Show was a real treat for me . I 've watched it on DVD several times and have enjoyed it each time .

neg	If there was ever a call to make a bad film that reflected how stupid humanity could become , this one would take the prize . The plot centers around bible prophecies that lie in hidden messages of the scriptures that prompt a group of power - seeking thugs to attempt total control of the world . Just how stupid does this writer believe people to actually be ?    The acting was bad at best . Casper Van Dien wasted his talent doing this film . Michael York 's work was a fair match for the role , since he was the center of the film , and did a good job .    This plot was sickening and very disturbing . No tender or immature minds should see this film . This is how a basic good vs. evil plot can go astray .   There must be a lot of mental disease floating around the film circles , who look for ways to market this type of junk . There must have been something censored out to get a PG-13 rating , but it was still awful .
pos	I have seen this movie and even though I kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning I still liked watching it . I would recommend it to other people . It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot . And I am thinking since it 's close to Halloween they might play it more . So please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it . I believe that Alicia Silverstone played her part very well . I really like her as an actress and person . She seems so nice and down to earth . Kevin Dillon he 's performance was so so for me . I am not trying to knock him or anything but I believe that his brother Matt would have been able to pull this bad evil serial killer persona better . Kevin just seems too sweet for me . But I think he did okay .
neg	Comes this heartwarming tale of hope . Hope that you 'll never have to endure anything this awful again . * cough * Razzie award * cough * I disliked this movie because it was unfunny , predictable and inane . While watching I felt like I was in a psychology experiment to determine how low movie standards could get before people complained . When I requested my money back at the end of the movie I was informed that because I watched the whole thing ' I was n't entitled to reimbursement ' . I was told by the assistant manager that several people had complained and gotten refunds already though . The movie summary is pretty basic . The midget thief steals a diamond and the poses as a baby to elude police . Underneath this clever outline however , lies a repertoire of original , fresh and hilarious skits . Or not . Ask yourself the following : Do you like to see people getting hit by pans ? Do you like fart jokes ? Do you like to see midgets posing as babies threatened with a thermometer in the anus ? Do you like tired racial jokes ? Do you think babies say ' goo goo goo goo goo gaa gaa ' ? Do you drool ? If you answered ' yes ' to any of the above then this movie is definitely for you . Although it has been billed in some places as ' The Worst Movie of the Decade ' , there is probably a movie or 2 that are worse ... somewhere . I ca n't say for sure . I gave this movie 2 stars because we all know a review with only one star would indicate bias on the part of the reviewer and then the review would n't be taken seriously .   This lowbrow comedy is intended for a less intelligent audience and I can not in good conscience recommend it to anyone . Save your money for something funny . Respect
pos	I 'm sure that most people already know the story - the miserly Ebenezer Scrooge gets a visit from three spirits ( the Ghosts of Christmas Past , Present and Yet to Come ) who highlight parts of his life in the hopes of saving his soul and changing his ways . Dickens ' classic story in one form or another has stood the test of time to become a beloved holiday favorite . While I grew up watching the 1951 version starring Alastair Sims , and I believe that he is the definitive Scrooge , I have been impressed with this version , which was released when I was in high school . George C. Scott plays a convincing and mean Ebenezer Scrooge , and the actors playing the ghosts are rather frightening and menacing . David Warner is a good Bob Cratchit as well . This version is beautifully filmed , and uses more modern filming styles ( for the 1980 's ) which make it more palatable for my children than the 1951 black and white version . This is a worthy adaptation of the story and is one that I watch almost every year at some point in the Christmas season .
neg	Another violent , angry fantasy from Paul Verhoeven . Verhoeven is a puzzle : it 's difficult to tell whether he takes his sordid impulses seriously , with sardonic intent or operates in complete oblivion . He also seems completely ignorant of the fact that all the brilliant visuals in the world ( and this has some outstanding ones ) can not hide a negligence to story , dialogue and performance . Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses it to drive himself into moral bankruptcy . Bacon is normally a likable actor who occasionally shows his dark side ( ` The River Wild ' ) in an attempt to offset his boyish looks ; given the material , however , Bacon is n't nearly hateful enough to compel . The other principals are Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin , neither of whom are gifted enough to make a solid impression and who , when forced to deliver inane dialogue , embarrass themselves . The climax is a study in preponderance and disbelief has to be truly suspended .
pos	The 1986 TV movie of The Spirit was a pilot for a possible series . However , Spirit creator Will Eisner did not like the film and thus no series was produced . I thought it was a very entertaining film and captured the spirit ( sorry ) of the comic with a modern twist . I 'm sorry it did n't materialize into a series . Sam ( Flash Gordon ) Jones was a perfect Spirit . Nana Visitor was a nice Ellen Dolan and of course would later go on to Star Trek : Deep Space Nine years later . Maybe with the release of Frank Miller 's big - screen version of The Spirit , more people will be able to see this rare gem of Spirit history . It seems that when Hollywood makes a film from an already established character or idea , someone will inevitably seek out previous versions of the property and release it to video in order to make a few dollars . When Antonio Banderas donned the mask of Zorro , we were able to get earlier versions of the masked hero on DVD , such as the great Alain Delon version of the 1970s ( although all copies I ever saw were badly edited ) . Heres hoping someone will release the TV adventure of The Spirit to DVD soon .
neg	This time the hero from the first film has become human and this time uses fist and foot combos against super universal soldiers and a computer which has gone awry and is prepared to take over the world . I 'm pretty sure it was Double Team , which convinced everyone that Jean - Claude Van Damme was no longer credible in providing watchable action flicks . However it was this that tarnished his credibility forever . While Universal Soldier : The Return is n't as dull as Double Team or The Quest , it 's still pretty awful indeed , with none of the style and flair of the original and no star pairing . This sequel is made simply for kids who enjoy professional wrestling . As I look back , not even the action sequences were all that exciting and therefore this movie is a worthless dud . In other words another clunker in Van Damme 's assembly line . * out of 4(Bad )
pos	" The Man in the White Suit " is another feather in the cap of expert Scottish director Alexander Mackendrick ( Whisky Galore ! , Sweet Smell of Success ) . The star of the film is Alec Guinness ( whose comedies include Kind Hearts and Coronets and The Lavender Hill Mob ) . Guiness brings his usual class to the film , and makes it much more than a typical comedy . In fact , the comedy is n't entirely overt . By the end of the picture , it 's nearly become a complete drama . It 's the sort of Ealing studio comedy that is calculated not to produce laughter , but a sense of general amusement , like the best British comedy of the time . The whole idea of the suit is n't very original , but the way it is executed is . The film is highly original , and recommended to any fan of Guiness or Britsh comedy . 7.6 out of 10
neg	When I first watched Robotboy , I found it fresh and interesting , but then I noticed , that with each episode this show is trying to teach you how to behave yourself , what is good / bad . Episodes became predictable . And main characters are not interesting . Again we see a hyper - smart boy , beaten by his older brother , parents who do n't understand their kid , and his friends : girl and fat boy . Also this show has no logic . A super - modern robot who works on two AA - size batteries , and can use a lot of weapons . But the biggest problem is the difference between activated and super - activated modes . We see two different robots , and it declines main idea of the show : " Robot must learn how to behave himself in human society "
pos	Do n't listen to the prissy critics who are probably bitter gamers still sore from the roasting Silverman infamously gave them at Spike TV Video Game Awards a couple of months ago , " The Sarah Silverman " is wonderfully bizarre , surreal , immature , ridiculous and would fit rather nicely in a Adult Swim line - up . If Silverman tones down the juvenile " doody " jokes and emphasizes the darker , meaner undercurrent the show is so far just hinting at , we could have one of the greatest cult comedies since the cancelled " Strangers With Candy " . But just from watching the pilot , its just solid , not outstanding , offbeat dark comedy / musical but with huge potential .   Silverman has created a hilarious child - woman of a character - a prettier , younger , Jewish American Princess version of the late great Jerri Blank and the show features one of the most unconventional , non - stereotypical portrayals of a gay couple I have ever seen on television . Early reviews are suggesting the next couple of episodes surpass the pilot so I ca n't wait to see how this show unfolds .
neg	Although there are a lot of familiar " television " names associated with " A Man Called Sledge " , there is nothing extraordinary about the film itself or about any of the performances . In fact , the only thing that distinguishes it from a 1960's-70 's television series like " The Rat Patrol " is a bigger cast and a lot more violence .   James Garner is the biggest star and apparently thought he should try to break away from all the light comedy stuff he had been doing ( " Maverick " , " Support Your Local Sheriff"-"Gunfighter " etc . ) . Unfortunately his earthy likability works against him , as Sledge is a humorless character written to cash in on the popularity of Clint Eastwood 's spaghetti western character . But Eastwood 's stuff was not this flat and uninteresting . I suppose that " A Man Called Sledge " could be classified as a spaghetti western although the pacing is too slow to really fit that sub - genre . Fans of the slow - paced " Combat " television series will feel an instant connection as Vic Morrow directed the film and co - wrote the script with Frank Kowalski . Throw in some then trendy slow - mo shots and cross - dissolves , which call attention to themselves rather than serve a story - telling purpose .   The plot is the standard " big heist " thing ( insert " The War Wagon " here ) with Sledge plotting how to heist a $ 300,000 gold shipment . His gang includes Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver . The problem is that while on the move the shipment is guarded by 40 outriders and while stopped it is locked in a vault inside the territorial prison . I think there was an episode of " Alias Smith and Jones " with the same plot . The story would make a decent hour of television but gets old very fast as a very padded feature length film . Garner does not allow any of his charm to leak into his characterization and the film does not generate enough suspense to hold a viewer 's interest . The thing finally crashes and burns shortly after the heist when the gang engages in a contrived and totally illogical card game .   Then again , what do I know ? I 'm only a child .
pos	Those who love the book Jane Eyre as I do ( it 's my all time favorite , and I re read it at least once a year ) will love this version . Timothy Dalton is just a tad too good looking to be Mr. Rochester , but other than that , he does a marvelous job portraying the brooding master of Thornfield . Zelah Clarke may have been just a little too old to play the 18 year old Jane , but when I watch this movie , I do n't think about the ages of the characters . The dialog from the film is taken almost verbatim from the book , which was very smart . Sure , this film might seem a little long , but it 's the only version I 've seen that includes part 3 of the story . I wish the people who made this film had been involved in the newer Zeferelli version , as it would have helped that mess of a film . I also realized the last time I watched this video that Judy Cornwell plays " Aunt Reed " ! She is so versatile that I did n't recognize her . She plays Daisy in Keeping up Appearances , and also played Mrs. Musgrove in 1995 's Persuasion ( another wonderful adaption ) . UPDATE : Got the DVD this week , and it 's marvelous to see the original unedited version . There 's lots more at the beginning ( Young Jane at Gateshead and at Lowood . ) And at the end , they 've restored lots of things , ( I always wondered why St. John had a slip of paper when he reveals that he knows who Jane is-- because the part where he tears it from her painting was edited out of the US VHS version ! ) . Rosamund Oliver is in it ... she was completely cut out of the VHS . As far as I could tell , they had n't edited out any of Timothy Dalton 's parts , so nothing new there , but it is great to see the whole miniseries in its entirety after all these years of enjoying the VHS . Thanks , BBC ( PS ... I would have paid more for a special edition DVD ... with maybe some interviews with the stars ... or a making of show )
neg	The main reason people still care about " Carlton - Browne Of The F.O. " is that it features Peter Sellers in a second - billed role . But watching this film to see Peter Sellers is a mistake . Sellers plays Amphibulos , a vaguely reptilian prime minister of the dirt - poor island nation of Gaillardia , formerly a British colony , now hosting a lot of Russian diggers during the height of the Cold War . Amphibulos wants to play both U.K. and Soviet interests against each other for easy profit , " everything very friendly and all our cards under the table " . Terry - Thomas is the title character , a lazy British diplomat anxious to show Gaillardia that Great Britain has n't forgotten them , all appearances to the contrary . A positive review here says : " The reason this movie is considered average is because the comedy is understated . " I would argue that the reason " Carlton - Browne " is considered below average is because the comedy is non - existent . After a decent opening that establishes the film 's only two strengths , a sympathetically doltish Terry - Thomas and John Addison 's full - on larky score , things quickly slow down into a series of slow burns and lame miscommunication jokes . The low opinion of Carlton - Browne by his boss and the obscurity of Gaillardia ( which no one can find on a map ) is milked to death . By the time we actually reach the island ( after a labored series of airsick jokes ) , expectations are quite low . They 're still too high , though . The island itself , which seems to exist either in Latin America or the Mediterranean , is so pathetic its honor guard faints at the airport , and the review stand falls apart in the middle of a parade . The army is apparently still horse drawn , allowing for another lame aural gag by a thick - accented announcer : " In war , the army uses many horse . " Sellers never quite takes center stage even when we 're on his character 's island . The plot is taken over instead by Ian Bannen as King Loris , who inherits the throne of Gaillardia after his father 's assassination . Bannen is dull and plays his part as straight as it is written . Normally this would make him the likely target for scene - stealing by Sellers , but trapped behind a thick accent and greasy moustache , Sellers is only a threat to those of us who remember him far more happily in two other films made this same year , " The Mouse That Roared " and " I 'm All Right , Jack . " Strange that this film , like " Jack " , was a Boulting Brothers production , with Roy Boulting here serving as co - director alongside Jeffrey Dell . Usually Boulting films combine wicked social satire with anything - goes comedy , but here there are only fey jabs in either direction . Amphibulos works his mangled - English vibe for all its worth ( " This man is like , how do you say , the bull in the Chinese ship " ) while Carlton - Browne is generally ragged on by his superior far more than he seems to deserve . The weakest and most protracted element of the film is young Loris 's romance with Ilyena . Score one point for her being played by ravishing Luciana Paluzzi , dock one for the fact that they are apparently cousins is never addressed . The film winds up with a lamely staged revolution whose surprise resolution will surprise no one , and a final bit of action by Carlton - Browne that would seem to nail the lid on his coffin literally . Apparently he lives to see another day , but the film of the same name is strictly DOA .
pos	My mom took me to see this movie when it came out around Christmas of 1976 . I loved it then and I love it now . I know everyone makes fun of Barbra 's hair in this one , but I think she looks and sounds great ! ... And I seem to remember a number of women who copied that permed look at the time ! Also , the bath tub scene between Streisand and Kristoferson is just so sexy ! The music is great as well . This is the groovy 70 's Babs at her best !
neg	Lets put it this way . I actually get this movie . I get what the writer / directer was trying to do . I understand that the dialog was meant to be dry and emotionless . I understand that the plot was supposed to be non - climactic and stale . That was what the writer / director was going for . A very very very dry humor / comedy . With all that understanding , I still think the movie sucked . It seemed like the writer / director was trying to recreate Napolean Dynamite with this movie . It had all of the same features . Even the main character behaved similar to Napolean . But Napolean Dynamite was actually funny . Its script worked . This movie is not . It has no purpose . Well , let me rephrase that . Its only purpose is to rip off Napolean Dynamite and try to capture that look and feel . Too bad it did n't work .
pos	I was always a big fan of this movie , first of all have you seen the cast , the acting is superb and help make this movie move along very well . Cybill Shepherd was given great reviews for her role , and they were well deserved . The beginning of this movie starts in the past when Corinne Jeffries ( Cybill ) whose picture - perfect marriage comes to a shattering halt when her husband Louie dies unexpectedly . Fortunately , Louse gets a second shot at life when he agrees to be " recycled " back to earth as the newborn Alex Finch ( Robert Downey , JR ) . Alex goes on to live his new life forgetting his past life while Corinne tries to get on with hers . But fate crosses Alexs path 23 years later when he meets Corinne 's daughter Miranda ( Mary Stuart Masterson ) and is suddenly flooded with a wealth of unwanted memories ( this is where the fun begins , and embarrassing situations occur . ) The music is great and the scenes are heart felt and very cute . You wo nt be disappointed if you give it a chance , Chances Are you 'll like it . Very funny and sweet !
neg	A great opportunity for and Indy director to make an interesting film about a rock musician on the brink of stardom . It could have been a decent film if it would have dealt with John Livien 's traumatic past and how it is torturing his psyche . Instead , it is a ridiculous attempt to identify John Livien 's life with John Lennon 's . John Livien 's suicida mother 's hero was John Lennon and she wished for him to become as powerful and prolific as Lennon himself . Instead of focusing on John Lennon 's musical brilliance , and his wonderful ability to bare himself for others to learn something about their own life , it showed Lennon 's legacy to be that of a confused , drug addicted soul , who should looked upon as a God instead a man . I am a huge John Lennon fan and this movie reminded me of another " crazy " person obsessed with Lennon , Lennon 's killer , Mark David Chapman . Lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by someone else who had an identity crisis with Lennon . Do we need to be reminded of that ? John Lennon gave so much to the world with his music and honesty and I was repulsed to see another disturbed person , as the main character in this movie obsessed by Lennon , and not show his beautiful contributions to the world . Yoko Ono graciously honored John Lennon 's memory , by making the memorial in Central Park to give his fans a chance to pay their respects , and remember John . Instead the director of this movie chose to use that site to have the killer attempt to commit suicide . I found this so disturbing and disrespectful to Lennon 's memory . He was a man of peace who died a brutal senseless death , and to see such violence near this site felt like a revisiting a terrible wound for any Lennon fan . It ruined the movie completely for me . It could have been a decent movie , but it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth . Let John Lennon , and his family rest in peace and not be reminded of his vicious murder by this irresponsible movie .
pos	Tsui Hark 's visual artistry is at its peek in this movie . Unfortunately the terrible acting by Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung ( I felt the urge to strangle her while watching this , it 's that bad :) made it difficult to watch at times . This movie is a real breakthrough in the visual department . When I first saw this , my jaw dropped repeatedly and I thought to myself that I 've never seen anything remotely like it but this is how it should be done in order to do full justice to the mythical world of Chinese historical kung - fu novels ! Without a doubt this is one of the best - looking Chinese historical kung - fu epic ever made . But alas , Tsui Hark has n't improved much in the writing department , and the story and dialog are rather juvenile ( his apparent obsession with the silly and overly - long depiction of the evil guys did n't help either ) . To make it worse , this movie is very badly cast . They decided to use the " hot " popular Hong Kong idols as lead characters , but unfortunately both Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung are totally unsuited for historical kung - fu dramas because they lack the nobility and mystique that such characters are supposed to embody . Adam Cheng Siu - Chow and Brigitte Lin in the 1983 version are infinitely better . I wish that someday Zhang Yi - Mou and Tsui Hark can join forces and produce a movie that has the visual artistry of Tsui but with the maturity and story - telling poetry of Zhang ...
neg	I watched this film because I noticed that it had Kari Wuhrer in the cast . I have long had a theory about her , that she is a talented actress , but never seems to get to prove that , because she is always in this sort of low - budget B movie . She is still beautiful , and she is still trying to act over the unfortunate material I always see her in . This is no different . The film is often ugly and disturbing , but that does n't make it good . George Wendt played against type , and that was so jarring that he gets recognition for his role . Another note about Ms. Wuhrer . Her breasts seem to have shrunk markedly since I saw her last . Perhaps reduction surgery , or ( more likely ) removal of implants . This NOT a bad thing . She still looks great . I would like to see her in a better movie .
pos	Rich , alcoholic Robert Stack falls in love with secretary Lauren Bacall . He marries her and is so happy he stops drinking . However , Bacall is secretly loved by Stacks ' best friend , Rock Hudson . And Stacks ' nymphomaniac sister , Dorothy Malone , lusts after Rock . Throw in a few complications and the movie goes spinning out of control ( in a good way ) . Very glossy movie in beautiful Technicolor with jaw - dropping fashions and furnishings ( check out Bacall 's hotel room at the beginning ) . Everybody looks perfect and dresses in beautiful , form - fitting clothes . Basically this is a soap opera with grade A production values . The story itself is lots of fun and some of the dialogue at the beginning is hilariously over the top . The acting by Hudson , Stack and Bacall is n't that good , but seeing them so young and glamorous is great ... especially Stack ... when he smiled my knees went weak ! Dorothy Malone , on the other hand , is fantastic -- she deservedly won Best Supporting Actress for her role . She 's sexy , violent , vicious and sympathetic ... all convincingly .   Fun , glossy trash . Do n't miss it !
neg	Six different couples . Six different love stories . Six different love angles . Eighty numbers of audience in the movie theater . Looking at the eighty different parts of the silver screen . I am sitting in somewhere between them looking at the center of the screen to find out what 's going on in the movie . All stories have got no link with each other , but somewhere down the line Nikhil Advani trying to show some relation between them . I tried to find out a few lines I could write as review but at the end of 3 hours 15 minutes found nothing to write . The movie is a poor copy of Hollywood blockbuster LOVE ACTUALLY . My suggestion . Do n't watch the movie if you really want to watch a nice movie .
pos	This film show peoples in the middle of the hottest 2 days in Austria . It shows people humiliating other peoples and being cruel to other peoples . It show the inability of people to communicate or talk with others . In the screening I have attended people were leaving in the middle because they could no longer watch the film . And rightly so . Because the film is not and easy one to watch . It has a very depressing message and there is n't any moment of mercy in the film . It is a very cruel movie , not for everyone 's taste . You can not speak of terms of enjoyment from this film . It grips you in your throat and never let go and in the end you simply feels breathless because of its intensity . I can not " recommend " or " not recommend " this film . You should make your own mind based on what I have said earlier . Just be aware that this is not a regular film and it is not for everyone 's taste .
neg	I wanted to see an action comedy with a satirical twist ( as this film was touted ) but this one failed me miserably . For me , the plot was a bit confusing to follow and I rapidly lost interest . I feel so sorry for John Cusack , Joan Cusack , Ben Kingsley , Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff for getting involved with this movie . I 'll remain a fan of all of them but only time can heal my feeling over this one . The one thing I can say positively about the film is that Hillary played Yonica 's character so well that I did n't even recognize Hillary ; it took me a few scenes to realize that it was her . Luckily I rented it for $ 1 through Red Box ; had I paid to see it in on the big screen , I would be really fuming ! !
pos	This is a great film - esp when compared with the sometimes wearisome earnestness of today 's politically - minded filmmakers . A film that can so easily combine sex , gender relations , politics and art is a rarity these days . While the bouyant optimism of the 1960 's ca n't be regained , I think we can at least learn a lesson from the film 's breezy energy and charm . I do n't know what those who label the film " boring " were watching - there 's so much packed into it that it never remains the same film for more that 15 min at a time .
neg	If you can believe it , * another * group of teens return to * another * lakeside cabin three years after * another * one of those fatal ' accidents ' claimed one of their number . Low and behold , a psycho wearing a patterned hockey mask ( a cheap papery one at that ) turns up to waste them one by one . This mechanical ' Friday the 13th ' knock off gained slight notoriety as one of the first digitally - shot features , but that 's where the interesting facts end and all that remains is a predictable , amateur production with sub - par performances and a recurring boom - mic intrusion . A last - second twist does little to lift the spirits , and ' Memorial Day ' is something best tossed in a lake and forgotten about . One for insane slasher collectors only .
pos	This is an excellent stand - up DVD ! Eddie Izzard is the funniest person I have seen in years . His routine is hilarious and makes for great conversation with others who have seen it . I HIGHLY recommend this one . The part about the history of Europe is a bit slow , but the ending jokes in French are quite good , because you do n't have to speak French to get it ( although if you do , it is still hilarious ) . Also , the parts about being a transvestite are quite good . The first scene ( about San Francisco ) is not great , but funny the first time . Skip over those if you can . It 's almost not worth watching . However , this really is a funny , funny stand - up show that everyone should see . " I was dead at the time ! "
neg	This movie provided NOTHING new or worthwhile . After seeing it , my wife and I both agreed that the studio simply churned this out and could have cared less if it was entertaining . This is a good example of a " concept only " film -- they have a concept about a film and the other details are unimportant because execs KNOW it will make $ $ just based on the initial concept . The movie starts with Cruella getting out of prison and going on parole . She no longer hates puppies but has been programmed to adore them -- she simply could n't hurt a flea . This does n't last too long after her release and she 's back to her old ways . Period . The most annoying aspects of the movie were the supporting characters . Eric Idle as the voice of Waddlesworth the bird made me HATE him -- and that is TOUGH considering I am a die - hard Python fan . It was obvious he did this because they gave him lots of money ( there ca n't be any other reason ) . Cruella 's low self - esteem servant , Tim McInnerny , was funny in the Black Adder shows but here he is totally wasted and unfunny . And it must have cost a few bucks to get Gérard Depardieu but he was utterly wasted as well . There were some other supporting actors as well but given how poorly written the characters were , I am trying to block them out of my mind . Overall , you 'd be better just to let your kids watch television than bother letting them see this drivel .
pos	Before Sunrise has many remarkable things going on , almost too many to fit into one review like this , but it 's suffice to say that it 's one of the most observant character studies of the nineties , maybe even in all of contemporary cinema , to be observant not about love , per - say , so much as it 's about a human connection . How does one fall in love at first sight ? No one does , at least that 's deep down the consensus that Linklater wants to show with his film . And * yet * there is the possibility of as intense a connection , of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time . Linklater here gives us the story of Celine and Jessie , a French girl and an American boy who get off the same train heading to Vienna , and on the way there start to talking about things , at first arbitrary , then personal ( Jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather ) . Jessie persuades Celine to go along with him on a night out on the ' town ' , in Vienna , until his plane the next morning . Before Sunrise gives Jessie and Celine , in the midst of the gorgeous Vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance , and in a sense is about the act of having conversations , of what it 's like to watch people having one leading into another and another . Here it 's often about relationships and commitments , as Jessie and Celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential , or seemingly so , and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities . We hear confessions of desires for other loves , or what were n't really loves , of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you 'll love your life , of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form , or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul ( I loved the bit about the quakers in the church ) , and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism . Jessie may be more responsible for that last part , but what 's fascinating about the film is that it 's never exactly cynical itself , just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives . Meanwhile , it 's always great to see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in these roles , where they 're not incessantly annoying in that 90s Generation - X mode , but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film , which is n't a bad one at all but a necessary one , one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere . The conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala Brief Encounter , only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other , where sweet asides are actually acceptable ( " I have to tell you a secret " , Jessie says , and then leans in for a kiss , ho - ho ) , or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way . I loved the scene with the poet , where it 's very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal , or with the palm reader and how the reactions from Jessie and Celine are that we might share , but really are seeing them do it first - hand . All the while Hawke and Delpy embody the roles interestingly- we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives- as it may lead off into the future ... Featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness , however self - contained , as it may lead into something more . Who 's to say you ca n't suddenly be attached to someone , if only for less than 24 hours , and be that much more attached than a married couple ? This is perhaps Linklater 's thesis , but there 's more to it than just that . It 's a very dense film , and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly . One scene especially , which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking ' on the phone ' in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the other 's friend . A+
neg	The acting , other reviews notwithstanding , was remarkably well - done . Brad Pitt handles the role of an annoying , obnoxious Austrian climber quite well . Other acting is fine . The story could have been riveting , but somehow , it misses - one never really understands or cares for the characters shown , and so the story , which could have been quite dramatic , fails to draw in this audience . Beautiful scenery and cinematography , a remarkably dramatic true story , important events that shaped the world that we live in - but I could not , try as I might , involve myself in this story . As an unabashed Brad Pitt fan ( I consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation ) , I expected to * love * this flick - and yet , it left me cold . It could be a failing within myself , but I tend to point toward the creative end of this movie - direction , scriptwriting , production , editing - somehow , they lost me . It 's a shame , because it could have been wonderful . Good acting , dramatic story , beautifully shot - it should have been magnificent . It was n't . Probably worth watching , just to make your own mind up on it - but do n't expect too much , and perhaps you wo n't be as disappointed as I was . Mostly , it bored me .
pos	I watched the McCoys reunion and was glad to see Richard Crenna and Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez!!!To see them now was wonderful , because I always watched the show growing up so when the TV said that there was going to be a reunion I was so excited ! ! ! ! The only thing I could not figure out is why Lydia Reed ( Hassie McCoy ) and Michael Winkelman(little Luke ) was not on there . I know that Walter Brennan had died . So I got on my computer and tried to find out about them and found this site so if there is anyone out there that can tell me what ever happened to Lydia Reed ( Hassie McCoy ) and Michael Winkelman ( little Luke I would be thankful ! ! ! I have searched everywere and no luck .The only thing I could find out about Michael Winkelman is he was supposed to be born in 1946 . This show had value and morals each show gave a lesson to be learned . The shows today do nt have that . The whole cast was incredable the only thing better than finding out obout them would be to meet them So since that is impossible if there is anyone that can help please do ! ! ! Thank You Glenda
neg	Filmfour are going to have to do a lot better than this little snot of a film if they 're going to get the right sort of reputation for themselves . This film is set in Glasgow ( although only a couple of secondary characters have anything approaching a Scottish accent ) . The premise , about people who 's lives are going nowhere , who all meet up in the same cafe in the early hours of the morning as they have night jobs , COULD have made for a really funny , insightful , quirky , cultish film . Instead we have a group of self - obsessed saddos and a plot which has been so done to bits I 'm suprised it has n't been banned . X and Y are friends . X is sleeping with Z. Y sleeps with Z as well . Oh you figure it out . A total waste of time . Painful dialogue - it sounded like something that a group of 16 year olds would have written for a GCSE drama project . The female character was completely superfluous - just written in as a token female in the hope that women would be cajoled into seeing it . If you 're the sort of thicko lad who laughs at beer adverts and can usually be found wandering round in packs shouting on Saturday nights in nondescript town centres then you will love this film and find it " a right laff " . Everyone else , run , do n't walk away from this sorry little misfit . And one question , when the group left the " boring " seaside town ( Saltcoats incidentally although they changed the name on the film ) , to go back to Glasgow , WHY did they do it via the Forton motorway services at LANCASTER which is in England ?
pos	This film is a lyrical and romantic memoir told through the eyes an eleven year old boy living in a rural Cuban town the year of the Castro revolution . It is an obviously genuine worthy labor of love .   The names CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD are merely attempts to wrongly market this as an action film . DREAMING OF JULIA makes much more sense . It has more in common with European cinema than with RAMBO and the revolution is merely an inconvenience to people 's daily lives and pursuits . That fact alone makes the film more honest than most works dealing with this time period in Cuban history . The excessive use of the voice - over narrator does undermine the story but the film makes up for it with unqualified clips from Hollywood films that say so much more visually than the narrator could . The comparisons to CINEMA PARADISO and are fair game as the film does wax melancholy about movies , but there is an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love .   The revolution , like the film JULIE , never seems to have an ending .
neg	Five minutes into this movie you realize that you have seen it all before . It is BOILER ROOM . It is THE FIRM . And it is THE DEVILS ADVOCATE . And there are NO new elements here . Except for the all - to - clear Bill Gates - allegory . Conpsiracies are always good stuff for movie - making , but why does it have to be so extreme ? Boiler room is a good movie , because it - for a while at least - seems realistic . In Antitrust everything is wrong . How realistic is it for example that your boss pay an impostor to be your girlfriend in order to make you work harder and control you ? I 'd give it 1 , but the soundtrack is OK , so 2/10 .
pos	Since I first saw this in the theater it has been my favorite . Since then I 've seen it countless times and I never get tired of it . The setting has a lot to do with it ( the Colorado I know would be jealous ) , but the storyline is original and I liked how it used small town mountain folk as the heroes . There has not been a movie I can compare this too . John Lithgow plays a smart villain , but I love how he is completely out of his element -- he has to follow Tucker around and that 's what keeps it interesting . This is an action movie at it 's BEST . I do n't think I 'll see another that is so entertaining . You do n't need 50,000 rounds fired to qualify as an action movie . It just has to keep you captivated , not shell - shocked .
neg	My god this movie is awfully boring . I am a big fan of Gina Gershon , when I rented this movie I expected a romantic drama , and some great performance from Gershon . Gershon is great as always , but she is not right actress for this role , she is too good for Rade Serbedzija . The romance between Gershon and Serbedzija 's characters is too unconvincing . And I absolutely hated Serbedzija 's character ( a wonman organizer ) , he is not charming in anyway in the movie . How did Dr. Lauren Graham ( Gershon ) is beyond my comprehension . Maybe Sean Connery , Robert DeNiro or Harrison Ford would have done a better job on this role , but they do n't have the European - ish looking I guess . Any way , I was so bored druing the movie . If you are looking for a good Gina Gershon movie , check out Bound , her best film so far . If you are looking for a romantic film about a younger woman and an older man , try some Harrison Ford or Sean Connery movies . Gina Gershon is so underrated , and she deserves better chance than this , I wish her to make better choice in the future .
pos	A female executioner ( played by the sexy Jennifer Thomas II ) has the fun job of fulfilling all the fantasies of all the men on death row before they meet their maker . And what a way to go . Lucky this film is not real , or we would have a lot more people in this world on death row . It starts out real slow . Low light and bad acting , like most ( B ) films . It gets better as it moves along . And ends with a bang . I would rate it very high on the low cost , very sexy movies of the 90 's . It 's a must see once the kids are away or in bed .
neg	Not a knock on Korman as he was very funny on the Carol Burnett show . He was also good at playing secondary characters in Mel Brooks ' movies ( " High Anxiety " comes to mind ) . He is , however , not a person who can carry a movie in dueling roles no less . This one is basically a " Gremlins " knockoff , following a tradition of such movies as " Critters " and " Ghoulies " . It is not a very good knockoff either , on par with " Ghoulies " , but with a much lighter tone to it as it is no where near as dark as that movie got . In fact , this one is too light and frothy , and unfortunately many of the jokes end up falling flat . Though I did give it a 3 for a score , this is only because there is a movie that is even a worse " Gremlin " knockoff . If you watched Mystery Science Theater 3000 you know the one I am talking about ... the infamous " Hobgoblins " . This one has a guy finding a little critter in some underground place ( I only saw this movie once a long time ago so I do n't remember everything to clearly ) and it starts out friendly enough . However , this creature quickly becomes unfriendly and of course more are spawned and that is the movie . More misses than hits in the joke department , and it is also really lame to see Korman playing the evil brother role . Best to skip this one , but then you may want to check it out just for kicks .
pos	Larry Fessenden has been thrashed by most of the comments on this forum . Well , the worst mistake , evidently , is the marketing of the movie and the way the DVD might have been targeted . Obviously , this is not a true horror movie , at least , not for people expecting anything that will be gory and instantly satisfying .   " Wendigo " is basically a film that seems to be told from the mind of the young Miles . Things that are not readily understood by children tend to stay in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and the menacing world they ca n't comprehend . It is obvious that Kim , the mother , is a psychologist , but she has no clue to what is going on in the mind of her son . This is also a story of alienation . It 's clear that the father , George , is a distant figure , perhaps a workaholic , who seems to be living in a different world . Miles ' fears reach a point of crisis during the week end in the country . That part of New York state , with its winter landscape , barren trees , play havoc on the little boy 's imagination . It does n't help that he encounters a strange figure in town , it creates even more doubts in his young mind . Ultimately , Miles ' world comes crashing down on him and he ca n't do anything , even evoking the Wendigo spirit . The film is well paced and acted . Patricia Clarkson is excellent , no matter where movie she is in . Jake Weber is perfect as the distant father who has an opportunity to come closer to a son he does n't understand . Erik Per Sullivan , as Miles , conveys the inner turmoil within him . I thought he was extremely effective since the whole movie is Miles own take on what 's going on around him . Finally , John Spredakos is perfect as the menacing Otis , a man who resents the world for the way he has turned out . Instead of putting this movie down , future viewers should approach it with a open mind .
neg	Your attitude going into Prom Night II will determine how much joy you take away from the film . If you 're expecting a horror masterpiece , look elsewhere . If you like campy movies that are rather fun to watch unfold , you 'll like this . Lisa Schrage has the time of her life playing an over the top Mary Lou and Wendy Loyd channels Schrage 's rage perfectly during her time " possessed " . Not classic cinema but a fun way to kill a couple of hours with a wicked ending .
pos	Homeward Bound is a beautiful film . Y'know the part where Shadow falls down the ditch ... thingy , I * cried * , considering I was only six , I cried ! it takes a lot to make me cry ! The dogs and the cat are excellently trained . A nice family movie , * not * for completely hardened non - fluffy people or animal - haters but could for soft - as - crap a.k.a . people like me . A good film overall , 10/10 !
neg	This movie has one redeeming feature . At one point , after a character is attacked by an ax - wielding fairy , his brother asks him , " Why is your dick over there , Chuck ? " After suffering through almost an hour of bad film , this almost made my drink come out my nose . Some of the acting is n't too bad , but the kids all stink and P. J. Soles should be ashamed of herself for doing this film . The story is weak and nobody does what you think ( or what common sense dictates ) they should . Of course , there are a lot of story points that do n't add up . For example , in one scene the ghosts of young children must concentrate hard to move a physical object so they can prove they exist , a difficult feat since they apparently ca n't interact with physical matter . However , minutes later they all pick up branches off the ground and beat the Tooth Fairy with them . Apparently they CAN sometimes move matter and sometimes they CAN'T. Go figure . Lots of blood and guts , though ... a few nice boobs . But this does n't make up for the deficiencies . If you want a movie about the Tooth Fairy , go rent " Darkness Falls " . I think it 's great , though a lot of other reviewers do n't share my opinion . At least it sets a mood .
pos	For all of the Has - Beens or Never Was 's or for the curious , this film is for you .... Ever played a sport , or wondered what it felt like after the lights went down and the crowd left .. this film explores that and more . Robin Williams(Jack Dundee ) is a small town assistant banker in Taft CA . , whose life has been plagued , by a miscue in a BIG rival high school football game 13 years ago , when he dropped the pass that would have won over Bakersfield , their Arch - Rival , that takes great pleasure in pounding the Taft Rockets , season after season . Kurt Russell(Reno Hightower ) was the Quarterback in that famous game , and is the local legend , that now is a van repair specialist , whose life is fading into lethargy , like the town of Taft itself . Williams gets an idea to remake history , by replaying the GAME ! He meets with skeptical resistance , so he goes on a one man terror spree , and literally paints the town , orange , yellow and black , to raise the ire of the residents to recreate THE game . After succeeding , the players from that 1972 team reunite , and try to get in shape to practice , which is hysterical . The game is on , Bakesfield is loaded with all of the high tech gadgets , game strategies , and sophisticated training routines . Taft is drawing plays in the mud , with sticks , stones , and bottle caps , what a riot ! Does Taft overcome the odds , does Robin Willians purge the demons from his bowels , does Kurt Russell rise from lethargy , watch " The Best of Times " for one of the BEST viewing experiences ever ! One of Robin Williams best UNDERSTATED performances , the chemistry between Robin and Russell is magic . And who is Kid Lester ? ? ? Holly Palance and Pamela Reed give memorable performances as the wives of Williams and Russell . Succeeds on Many Levels . A 10 !
neg	A rating of " 1 " does not begin to express how dull , depressing and relentlessly bad this movie is .
pos	I was the Production Accountant on this movie , and I also got to do some voice - over work on it , so I 'm not entirely unbiased , but if it were awful , I would say so . I thought it was a fun film , not a critically acclaimed masterpiece , by any means , but there were plenty of laughs along the way . The Bible states that laughter does good like a medicine , so watching this movie could be good for your health . So many of the actors in this picture had n't yet reached their peak at the time we made this film . Susan Sarandon , of course , is one who has since gone on to much greater fame . Melanie Mayron was seen on TV on a weekly basis as a photographer in the " Thirty - Something " TV drama series . Robert Englund later became known as Freddie Krueger , still haunting people 's dreams . One of my personal favorite actors on this show was Dub Taylor , who played the sheriff . He was an excellent comedic actor , and a truly nice , sincere person . We all had fun working on this show , and I think that fun comes through .
neg	What I found so curious about this film -- I saw the full 4 hour roadshow version , is how oddly dispassionate it is . For a film about 2 very charismatic men -- Castro and Che , engaged in a gargantuan political struggle , it 's almost totally devoid of emotional fire . The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir ( who is at best a second level actor , with a slightly high pitched voice ) have no drama or depth and basically come down to Castro telling Che : go here , go there , do this and that , with no explanation as to what effect or use this action will result in . Odder still is there is an actor in the cast who has the requisite power to play Castro -- Joaquim de Almeida , but he 's shunted aside in a minor part in the second half . Without the tension or passion that you would expect to fire these men and their followers , the film becomes a dullish epic - length film about hairy , bearded men running through various jungles shouting and shooting to no particular purpose or end . Several of the reviews I 've read showered praise on the work of director Steven Soderbergh while ignoring the actors almost completely . ( One in fact spent more time talking about Soderbergh 's new digital film camera than the plot or actors or the fact that it 's entirely in Spanish with English subtitles.)This is an odd , odd thing to do since a ) Soderbergh was only a hired gun on the film and b ) it 's no more than a competent job of work , with an unremarked upon nod to Oliver Stone 's JFK in the black and white cut up camera - work when Che visits New York . If you can imagine Reds directed by Andrew McLaglen instead of Warren Beatty , you 'd get an idea of the dull competency of this movie .
pos	In the area of movies based off of screenplays from some other area ( or whatever the title for that Oscar is ) , " Holes " has credibility . I think it is better to have the author create the screenplay because the author is the creator of the material . If the author ca n't write a screenplay to save their life , then have the author and someone fluently talented in the area of screenwriting create it . Aside from that , this review is about " Holes " . The reasons start here and a spoiler maybe found within . ( 1 ) Louis Sachar is an excellent author and it turns that he can write a screenplay . I watched the movie and then read the book and both did n't reek incoherence or stupidity . Some people just have natural talents that can transcend mediums . ( 2 ) The best performance award goes to Shia LaBeouf for his portrayal as the main character . He " dug " himself into the role . I wanted to see his character vindicated before the conclusion . ( 3 ) To ratchet up the suspense a bit , Andrew Davis was brought in . This is the man that made Harrison Ford run hard and run fast . He also can make Steven Seagal smash some heads . As for this film , he made Shia and the rest of the boys dig some holes . In other words , he can make an " action - packed " movie and make it well even if " action " is n't the main genre is n't " action " . ( 4 ) My second favorite performance goes to Jon Voight as Mr. Sir . Sometimes a goofy role brings out the best in a performer . When Voight uttered the line " Once upon a time ... " , I must have laughed for half a minute because it was so funny . He is capable of comedy and he should investigate a few more roles that let him to exercise that talent . ( 5 ) Tim Blake Nelson is very solid whenever he is given a solid script . This is probably the second best role I have seen him in ( second only to ' O Brother Where Art Thou ? ' ) . ( 6 ) I love the choice of settings for the movie . I did n't know California was that dry or that barren . I guess population and land area figures both can be misleading . ( 7 ) The overall look of the movie made me want another bottle of water . One could only imagine digging a hole in that barren area for half a day . ( 8) The rest of the cast should deserve a box of Kudos bars as well . Sigourney Weaver , Henry Winkler , Khleo Thomas , Jake M. Smith and the rest of the bill were tapped because of their talents and it gelled very well . Great cast even though it was anywhere near ensemble . ( 9 ) I like a movie that does n't explain anything right away . When Stanley got clocked in the head with those baseball cleats , it made me want to see how weird the events could get and that is a key ingredient in making a good movie . ( 10 ) Disney Pictures ( not Touchstone , DISNEY ! ! ) needs to make a few more of these mature juvenile films . It was palatable for me and I am a college student . The last mature juvenile Disney film I saw was " Something Wicked This Way Comes " and " Holes " possibly exceeds it ( like the election in 2000 , it 's still to close to call ) . Disney can make greatness if they decide to expand on this genre and keeps artistry in mind over milking a cash cow when they see it . Ten reasons give a score of ten ! All in all , " Holes " is one of my favorite Disney films and probably one of the best this year ( granted this movie may not be Oscar material but whoever said Oscar material is the best material ? ) . In terms of being a movie from a book I have read , this ranks behind " Fight Club " on my list ( which is on top ) . For being a film I saw in 2003 , this is in the top five ( somewhere behind " Mystic River " ) . Compared against " Harry Potter " , Stanley Yelnats easily takes a shovel to Harry 's head and brings the final death blow with a smelly sneaker to Potter 's nose . Everybody should see this movie because it both informs and entertains . Here ends my rant !
neg	Well the previews looked funny and I usually do n't go to movies on opening night especially with my kids because ...... well you never know . Here is a movie that does n't appeal either to children or adults as the jokes are too perverse for children and falls completely flat for entertainment purposes for adults . I was actually embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year old and having to explain to my 6 year old what S H * T spells . Essentially what happens here is a total twisting of Dr. Seuss 's classic . It adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the children 's mother for her money . If that was a subplot , then maybe that would have been fine but it ends up being the major plot around the whole movie and " the cat " plays more of a subplot role in exposing the neighbor to the mom for who he really is . Take my advice and read the book and pass on the movie .

After engaging in soulful conversation for hours , Mark and Daria get naked , and make love in the sand . But with Mark evading the law , they realize that he needs to keep running . So Mark and Daria 's brief tryst is quite poignant , because it does n't get to develop into a full - blown romance . Zabriski Point was the Eraserhead of the early 70s . Both films have a rambling , vague quality , along with complicated meanings and characters . Frechette was as reckless in person , as his character was in this film . A few years after making Zabriski Point , Frechette robbed a bank in real life . While serving his prison sentence , Mark died an ignoble death . He was killed by a 150 lb . weight , which fell on him when he was weightlifting .   The best thing about this movie was the splendid cinematography , and special visual effects . The incredible , slow - motion scenes of debris floating in the air after an explosion , were a stroke of genius . Although not as ground - breaking a film as Easy Rider was , Zabriski Point still resonated with the early 70s counterculture . I recommend it , for those who like avant - guard films which showcase the upheaval , of the youth rebellion during the early 70s .
neg	This movie could have been so much better with a script rewrite . Not that I expect a great deal of plausibility in movies , but you 'd think that even the homeless and urban - dwelling Jack Mason would question why a group of experienced hunters would want to hire him as a hunting guide . And upon reaching the hunting grounds , poor Ice - T plays his part as if he is actually going to lead these men through woods he 's never seen before . And how does Jack Mason find Thomas Burns back in Seattle ? I 'm assuming this movie was based on Richard Connell 's short story " The Most Dangerous Game . " A few years ago I showed this movie to a class of 9th grade students after they read the story . I reedited the movie , cutting out all the pointless scenes and all the profanity . It ended up being 43 minutes long .
pos	But this is a great martial arts film . Liu Chia Liang ranks second to none as a fight choreographer , only Sammo Hung at his best compares . This is immediately clear from his proud exhibition of technique -rather than flashy camera angles etc . - during fights . The direction is tightly controlled to not only excite the viewer by the speed and movement but to awe her with the precise skill displayed . This film benefits also from Liu 's participation in front of the camera . Liu 's performance at the banquet scene with which the film opens is one of the high points in kung fu movie history . Liu is supported by the beautiful and talented Hui Ying Hung ( of My Young Auntie fame ) and ' Hsiao Hou ' whose acrobatics are breathtaking , and preferable to any amount of wirework As for the plot , this film follows the not uncommon theme of revenge , but with character and moral development along the way , and a most fitting resolution . The humour in this is also of the best . If you only watch one kung fu film ever , this would be a good choice- it has it all .
neg	I 'm trying to picture the pitch for Dark Angel . " I 'm thinking Matrix , I 'm thinking Bladerunner , I 'm thinking that chick that plays Faith in Angel , wearing shiny black leather - or some chick just like her , leave that one with us . Only - get this ! - we 'll do it without any plot , dialogue , character , decent action or budget , just some loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike . Fanboys dig loud bangs and hot chicks in shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bikes , right ? " Flashy , shallow , dreary , formulaic , passionless , tedious , dull , dumb , humourless , desultory , barely competent . Live action anime without any action , or indeed any life . SF just the way Joe Fanboy likes it , in fact . :(
pos	A movie you start watching as a late night cable porn ..... It is hot in that department but it has even a lot more .... It has a sense of humor ... some action in and out of the " bed " and it has reasonable acting as well as a story worth watching ... A definite adult only movie but well worth watching ...
neg	Dear Friends and Family , I guess if one teen wants to become biblical with another teen , then that 's their eternal damnation - just remember kids , " birth control " does n't mean " oral sex " , I do n't care what the honor student says . On the other hand , even if the senator 's aid quotes himself as a " bit of a romantic guy " , he 's still only hitting on a high school girl . If she was my sister , I 'd eat this guys kneecaps . Other than that I found out that Mongolians do n't kiss the same way the French do and that baseball players named Zoo like delicate undergarments . I think I 'd almost rather watch Richie Rich one more time than suffer the indignity of this slip , slap , slop . Thank you , and good night .
pos	Castle in the sky is undoubtedly a Hayao Miyazaki film . After seeing it for the first time I 'm glad to say that it does n't disappoint . On the contrary , you get your time 's worth , which means ( as to what Miyazaki 's films are concern ) , that is nothing less than excellent !   Produced early in his cinematic career , Castle in the Sky anticipates many of the trade marks in his later movies , with strong ( but young ) female characters , forced to grow up due to external circumstances , helped out by very interesting ( and some times lovable ) supporting characters . And , of course , the usual battle of nature versus civilization , flying machines ( lots of it ! ! ) , beautiful painted sceneries   but alas , no pigs ( at least that i 've noticed , after all I have only seen it once ) . Never the less , Miyazaki had already got his theatrical debut two years earlier , with Nausicãa , which was a dress rehearsal for Princess Mononoke , his magnum opus . Castle in the Sky is set a bit a part from these two , with a soft action packed first 30 minutes , resembling his TV series Conan , and his directed episodes of Meitantei Holmes . In here we are introduced to Sheeta , a girl who literally falls from the sky , only to be found by Pazu , a young boy working in a little countryside mining town . Intrigued by her amnesia and suspecting a connection between her and the mysterious flying city of Laputa , Pazu is set on helping her find out where she came from , whilst escaping the army and a gang of air pirates . As the movie progresses , the plot gets heavier and much more interesting , revealing Myiazaki at his best .   The sound track is very reminiscent of Spirited Away , ( or vice versa , as Castle in the sky was produced first ) , and much like its director , Joe Hisaishi _ the composer _ starts with a very light score , that gets more complex and beautifully fitting as the plot goes forward !   A note to the English dubbing , with a good interpretation from the two lead stars , although Anna Paquin 's Sheeta has a very thick accent ( which the actress still had at that point in her career ) , and a heads up for Mark Hamil as Muska , making up for a delighting yet devilish villain !   Do n't miss this one people !
neg	... the child actors were annoying . Also it seems as if the makers on this film were struggling to fill 90 minutes . Decent death scenes , though . If not for the death scenes , this movie would have a very Disneyish feel to it . The main child protagonist did n't seem nearly as scared as she should have been . If I was in the middle of the woods with a tooth fairy ghost killer type individual , you can bet your arse I would n't be out wandering around and riding my bike . Overall , I 've seen worse ( i.e. It Waits ) but it 's nothing I would watch again , or recommend anyone bothering with it unless you 're an avid horror collector .
pos	The movie was a long awaited release , which where a bit disappointing because of the expectation 's I had set up . When looking at it again I must say it is actually pretty OK . First of all is it very true to the original history ( of course not completely ) and is as such only made to keep the right for the movie . Modesty 's history as a child is shown and is very true to the original . The acting is perhaps not the best around and the plot is a bit thin , but when you compare it to the 1966 Vitti movie is way better just because it is not trying to be a musical . Generally would I only recommend it to fans of Modesty Blaise or to someone who by catch it on the TV .
neg	I am very tolerant of really bad sci / fi and horror movies - I 've been watching them since I was 4 or 5 , so I 've seen some really bad stuff , but I deal with it . I 've even watched a lot of SciFi Channel movies so I know not to expect much - a usually promising movie that has no ending to speak of . Hope springs eternal , I guess - or the triumph of hope over experience , as they say . Unfortunately , this is a dog right from the beginning and I knew it , but like a moth to the flame , I kept thinking something , anything , interesting would happen . It does n't . All of the actors give a decent performance - given the script , I do n't know how they all kept straight faces . It has something to do with collagen - starved worm parasite creatures who are slowly taking over the human race , one body at a time . There 's an evil plastic surgeon who collaborates with the enemy by giving them the outward appearance of humans ... don't worry , he gets what 's coming to him . The slug people themselves do n't really know where they came from , they think they might have thumbed a ride on a meteor that landed on earth , but ... somehow they know about the members of slug royalty among them - the slug princess has managed to breed with a human being who knows that she 's the worm queen and loves her for her self ... oh , must I go on ? Please , I implore you , do not waste 2 hours of your life watching this ... anything would be better ... think of the worst , least enjoyable way you can spend two hours ... it would be better than this .
pos	Being a fan of Andy Goldsworthy 's art for a while now , and owning some of his books , I had some expectations of what I would see . What I got was something completely satisfying , and quite a bit more than I expected . Being an artist myself ( I work in clay ) , finding inspiration within our surroundings to make good art is imperative , and it is something Andy Goldsworthy has mastered . Following him over the course of a year , the director captures the spontaneous energy , skill , and devotion to the artists connection with nature with dratic inspiring flair . The music set to the film is embracing and intoxicating . If you are an artist in need of inspiration , or anyone else in need of an uplifting experience , then SEE THIS MOVIE . I for one am glad to know that Andy is somewhere out there . Creating , dancing , wrestling with the forces of nature to make our world more beautiful .
neg	Okay . Look- I 've seen LOTS and I do mean LOTS of these types of films . You know , the ones where the DVD cover just look SO good and scaarrryyy that you just ca nt WAIT to see it ? Well , I got GOT again . And I 'm getting ' pretty tired of it . But I digress . It 's pretty simple . It sucked(I know , rather juvenile ) but it did . AndI SO agree with the other poster that if we had to sit through the boring thing , why oh WHY did the lead actress have to be so unnattractive?Distractingly so if I may add . And the scowl she used convey unresolved pain / grief over the death of her daughter did little help . I mean , Jesus .. Oh , but the crawling - on - her - back - demon thingee was pretty neat ...
pos	It is fitting on a musical Sunday to get your heart a pumping , and no one can do that better than Little Richard . The man could sing the drawers off the ladies and defined rock and roll . Look to Leon to provide a definitive characterization , as he has done so with David Ruffin in The Temptations and Jackie Wilson in Mr. Rock ' n ' Roll : The Alan Freed Story . This was a fascinating biopic as we saw Little Richard struggle with his father , with his church and with himself over just who he was . He won the battle and there is no one else that has his voice or his style .
neg	This is one of the silliest movies I have ever had the misfortune to watch ! I should have expected it , after seeing the first two , but I keep getting suckered into these types of movies with the idea of " Maybe they did it right this time " . Nope - not even close . Where do I begin ? How about with the special effects ... To give you an idea of what passes for SFX in this movie , at one point a soldier is shooting at a " Raptor " as it runs down a hallway . Even with less than a second of screen time , the viewer can easily see that it is just a man with a tail apparently taped to him running around . Bad bad bad bad . How about the acting ? If that 's what you can call it . There is one character who , I suppose , is supposed to be from the south . However , after living in the south for six years now , I have never heard this way of talking . Perhaps he has some sort of weird disability - the inability to talk normally . I find it fascinating that the character does nothing that requires him to have that accent - therefore there was no reason for the actor to try to do one . How about the plot ? It 's pretty basic - Raptors escape , people with guns must hunt them down . I 'm starting to wonder why the dinosaurs in these movies always seem to run into the nearest system of tunnels ... would n't they stay outside to hunt prey ? Oh well , at least they have the good sense to appear very very little in the movie which supposedly revolves around them . Other things - Let 's say you are in a building and you know that there are man eating raptors running around in it . Would you decide to take time out to have an argument about who is better - Army or Marine ? And then decide to have an arm wrestling contest to settle it ? How about the idiotic idea that they have to track down the raptors - Split up into groups of two . Did n't they ever watch any horror movies ( Or at least an episode of Scooby Doo ) ? In short , this is one of the dumber movies out there . Miss it unless you want to groan your way through a movie .
pos	The quality of this movie is simply unmatched by any baseball title of its time . Pam Dixon branches out in the film industry to recruit blue - chip prospects and make this work of art a must - see . Academy Award winners Brenda Fricker ( Home Alone : Lost in New York , A Time to Kill ) , Ben Johnson ( The Last Picture Show , Red Dawn ) , and Adrien Brody ( The Pianist , The Village ) amplify the atmosphere of the movie , drawing in an anxious audience . However , the dramatic performances are neutralized by quirky radio broadcaster Jay O. Sanders ( JFK , The Day After Tomorrow ) . The story is centralized around a foster child , up - and - coming actor Joseph Gordon - Levitt ( Brick , The Lookout ) . Sidekick Milton Davis Jr. delivers a tear - jerking performance as the longtime friend who never knew his parents . The two do n't have much , but what they do have : Angels ' baseball , and what they are seeking : identity . That 's when 4-time Emmy Nominee Danny Glover ( Lethal Weapon , Predator 2 ) comes in to save the day as frustrated Angels Manager , George Knox . In relation , all characters in the story seem to have the same mission : search within themselves to find out who they really are . Depressed over the fact that Roger ( JGL ) is separated from his father , he wishes to God for reunification if the Angels can take the pennant . Odds are astronomical , but 3-time Emmy winner Christopher Lloyd ( Back to the Future , My Favorite Martian ) comes in as the omniscient overseer to work a little magic ( pun ) . Before you know it , Al ( Lloyd ) is sitting with Roger in the stands , snacking on cracker jacks , and causing some of baseball 's biggest boners ! Dorothy Kingsley and George Wells ' ( DK Oscar Nominee GW Oscar Winner ) 1951 screenplay is done justice under the finger of mastermind William Dear ( nominated in Directors Guild of America ) . He includes a touching side story centered around pitcher Mel Clark , played by Tony Danza ( 4-time Golden Globe nominee , Emmy nominee ) , who in relation to all other cast members is just trying to find his place in a confused Anaheim . Clark has been dubbed a wash - up , a once big - name in Cinci , but he has something to prove to Manager Knox . Spoiling this nail - biting plot would simply be the equivalent to committing adultery in the 18th century . This one is a diamond in the rough , and it will keep you on the edge of the seat until all come to peace . Did I mention a cameo by Matthew McConaughey ( A Time to Kill , We Are Marshall ) for all you ladies out there ?
neg	I do n't know what would be so great about this movie . Even worse , why should anyone bother seeing this one ? First of all there is no story . One could say that even without a story a movie could be worth watching because it invokes some sort of strong feeling ( laughter , cry , fear , ... ) , but in my opinion this movie does not do that either . You are just watching images for + /- 2 hrs . There are more useful things to do . I guess you could say the movie is an experiment and it is daring because it lacks all the above . But is this worth 2 hrs of your valuable time and 7 EUR of your money ? For me the answer is : no .
pos	This a good episode of The New Twilight Zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories ( I note both of them are based on short stories ) . " Examination Day " is set in the future , year unknown but at a point where they have cake candles that light themselves , huge TV - looking " phones " that double as numerous other entertaining machines and distributed only to those of a certain age ... and the Examination Day , a point where 12-year - olds must undergo a government - required IQ test . The kid is this story , Dickie Jordan ( David Mendenhall ) is just celebrating his own 12th birthday and is a smart kid , so is calm , even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will excel at based on his school grades . His parents ( Christopher Allport and Elizabeth Norment ) , on the other hand , say he should n't have used his birthday wish on getting a good score , and while their reason includes that they believe he 's capable and he should have no need to worry , it 's pretty obvious they are worried . I wo n't give anything away in the ending , but I will say this - there 's a point where we get a glimpse of what 's to come as far ass why the test is such a heavy subject : that evening ( or another ? ) his parents ask Dickie whether he 'd prefer to watch TV all night . By today 's standards , we 'd be pleased he 'd say he 'd rather read and not just because there 's nothing worth watching ... but why would his family ask this ? The flavor of what 's encouraged and discouraged in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from Harrison Bergenon ( which I hear has n't received a great adaptation to the screen ) . I only wish they could 've provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as The Obsolete Man was . I found it to be better than the short story it was based on . I have n't read the one that " A Message from Charity " was based on , but would like to since it was interesting - a 16-year - ld boy , Peter ( Robert Duncan McNeill ) is suffering a fever from unclean water , that has always been common in his Massachusetts hometown ... but he is able to see through the eyes of a young Puritan woman suffering the same type of fever , Charity Payne , ( Kerry Noonann ) who also finds herself able to experience what goes on around him . They both recover , especially since it 's common for that to happen in 1985 , but the connection does n't go away . Charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of 1985 and they each enjoy each other 's company , especially Peter , who has promoted grades in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students , even at the college he 's been staying in one place at . Things take an unexpected turn , though , when Charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the 13 colonies will breach from England as a sign of bewitchment , added to the fact that she was spared death from the fever ( not so common in 1700 ) . The two try to learn a way to save her . The ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching . Both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times , through a lesson / warning that sounds like something Rod Sterling would 've cooked up and entertainment , make cheerful watching as reminders that friendship , love , and wisdom do a great deal . Probably 3/4 of this has no theme , but somehow I think it all would have been approved by Sterling 's crew .
neg	Gayniggers from Outer Space is a short foreign film about black , gay aliens who explore the galaxy until they stumble upon Earth . Being gay , their goal is to have a male - only universe in which all people are gay . Hence , when they discover women or " female creatures " live on Earth , they are at first terrified ; eventually they decide to eliminate all women on the planet and liberate the male population . An offensive title with a racist , homophobic and sexist storyline , albeit probably intended as a satire , give this film some shock value . However , there 's little substance underneath . As another reviewer pointed out , there are few jokes besides the characters ' names ( eg . ArmInAss ) ; I think I laughed once at one small gay joke . I think I got the point of the film quickly , a satire of bad science fiction , but after that I had had enough ; I kept wanting the film to end already ( and it is a short film ! ) . Not brilliant or particularly well - written .
pos	One is tempted to define the genre of Gert de Graaff 's movie as ` event of the thought ' following the example of Merab Mamardashvili . The nominal storyline is a certain Bart Klever 's torturous quest for that ephemeral substance which constitutes the essence of personality . The script for his new movie is taking shape simultaneously on his computer and in his own imagination . This film - monologue originated as a response to Fellini 's ` 8 ½ ' and cost Gert de Graaff 13 years of work . Excitedly playing with real and fictional characters as well as with the audience , it reveals the whimsical interconnection of the real and imaginary , the paradoxical co - existence in two different galaxies : that of Guttenberg and that of MacLhuen . For some time we are apt to side with the script writer , who believes that the cause of all misfortune is the damned stereotypes of mass mentality ( ` man ' , ` catholic ' , ` window washer ' ) . And together with him we fall into a trap when the author - creator is finally faced with the insoluble dilemma : how can one eliminate from the future movie . Bart Klever ? Just five minutes before the finale thanks to the common petty reproaches of the wife of the creator , who is deeply immersed in work , we realize that together with the main character we have again been ` framed ' . Really , what is the price of the art for the sake of which it is acceptable to renounce one 's own name and the day - to - day care for the young daughter ? So who is he , this Bart Klever ? Is he a brilliant prophet or someone possessed like Frenhoffer from Balzac 's masterpiece ( just like the latter the script writer in the end erases from the computer memory everything has written ) ? Gert de Graaff suggests that we answer this question ourselves .
neg	Okay , I remember watching the first one , and boy did it suck . After watching it , I just laughed it off and told myself , " oh boy , just another low budget B - movie . I 'll never see a part 2 to this one . " Then , about 1 1/2 years later , there came part two . It sucked even more . But , I just laughed it off again and said , " there 's no way I 'm ever gon na see a part 3 to this one . " Then , about 1/2 a year later , part 3 came out . I was stupid enough to rent it and boy , I just snapped after watching it . God , I never actually realized how much movies can suck these days . Just save yourself $ 7.50 and do n't rent the whole series . Trust me , it 's worth every penny .
pos	Arthur has always been a personal film for me for two reasons . A good friend of mine who worked on the film as an extra and to help out with the horses during the stable scene just recently passed away . If you look fast you can see Frank Graham during the restaurant scene in the background while Dudley Moore and Jill Eikenberry are in conversation . Frank was a champion equestrian and will be missed by all who knew him . Secondly though , I actually knew a real life Arthur Bach . He was not quite as wealthy as Arthur , but spent 47 years of his life basically as a kid . His parents tightly controlled his purse strings , but his rent and utilities were paid for in a basement apartment in Greenwich Village . He spent a good deal of his time getting himself intoxicated on various spirits and making a public spectacle of himself , just like Dudley Moore does .   The wonder with Arthur is why anyone would bother with him wealth of not . But that 's the other half of the equation . My friend was a most charming person when you got to know him . In fact it was almost a compulsion to be charming . He could n't buy a newspaper or magazine without trying to establish some level of relationship with the vendor . He spent his life being a perfect party guest . The term wastrel which was in common use in the 19th century would apply to him . And that 's what Dudley Moore is , a wastrel . Unlike my friend Moore has John Gielgud to clean up after him . That 's a full time job as we see demonstrated in Arthur . My friend also never found a Liza Minnelli , a male Liza Minnelli in fact because he was gay . Still Moore 's portrayal of Arthur Bach is deadly accurate and so real for me . Arthur , 20th century wastrel , is being forced to marry another trust fund baby in Jill Eikenberry . Since he wo n't work for a living , the threat of being cut off is quite real for him . He only has his butler Hobson played by John Gielgud and chauffeur Bitterman played by Ted Post to pour his troubles out to . We should all have such troubles . John Gielgud in his nearly century of life certainly did better work than in Arthur on film and in fact Gielgud is more prominently known for his stage performances . Yet 1981 was a year of sentiment at Oscar time . The Academy gave Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn Oscars for On Golden Pond and Gielgud the Best Supporting Actor Award essentially for the work of a lifetime . That man was amazing , still at his craft almost to the end . So to Frank Graham who worked in the film and to Jackie Weiss , a genuine real life Arthur , I dedicate this review .
neg	The character of Tarzan has been subjected to so many clichés , and so many bad interpretations , that those who are hoping for a different kind of version ( people like me , I mean , who liked the Tarzan books as a kid and have always wished for a movie version that followed the books just a little ) ought to know how the recent renditions stack up . Some of the IMDb reviews address this point , but here 's my $ .02 I am aware of only two -- count ' em -- cinema depictions of Tarzan , namely Greystoke with Christopher Lambert and the Disney animated version , that try to depict Edgar Rice Burrough 's rather interesting character ( the son of a marooned English noble couple , picked up after their death by a tribe of apes who raise him as one of themselves , and who becomes " lord of the jungle " because of his superior human intellect before making it back to England and claiming his other identity ) rather than the usual Hollywood jungle - man whose origin remains obscure and whose trademarks are his famous yell , his mysterious inability to speak proper English despite long exposure to people who know the language , his habit of swinging on vines , his strength , heroism , etc . About the only thing these two characters have in common are the name Tarzan and the fact that they both have a wife named Jane . Ron Ely 's TV version is something of a compromise : Like Burroughs ' character , he speaks good English and is adept and suave in both cultures in a sort of JamesBondish way , but he 's no Lord Greystoke and there 's no Jane . Well , this film is in a third category of Tarzan films , and I hope it remains a category of one because it 's awful . This category uses the character as a vehicle for , of all things , soft porn . Jane , played by legendarily bad actress Bo Derek is in Africa looking for her dad the absent - minded professor who is combing the jungle looking for something which is never specified . Though her dad is supposed to have been missing for a long time , she finds him effortlessly . Richard Harris as the dad is the best thing here ; he sees the film is stupid so he has fun overacting and hamming in a way that reminds me of Peter O'Toole 's deliberately silly performance in What 's New Pussycat . Dad explains the legend of Tarzan ( " some sort of ghost or spirit " he says -- either a steal from , or an inartistic attempt at homage to , King Kong ) to his daughter , who is at this point unfamiliar with the ape - man . Shortly afterward , we hear the infamous cliché of the Tarzan yell . Dad dies , which oddly does n't seem to faze his devoted daughter very much . And then ..... Then Tarzan appears , but says nothing . Indeed , he says nothing during the entire film . He and Jane fall in love , and they romp around wearing almost nothing as she recites doggerel love - poetry off - screen . The End . That 's the plot .   Well , not exactly ; there 's also a scene where Tarzan wrestles unrealistically with a boa constrictor -- a most unusual boa , since it 's the only poisonous one ever seen . Jane treats the bite with the aid of a chimp who helps by wringing out the garment she tears off to bind the wound with ( I 'm not making this up ! ) , and this is only one of many excuses for her to take her clothes off . I always like to conclude a review by saying something positive , but this time it 's hard . Let 's see ... well , it 's unfair to criticize this film for featuring an orangutan , even though we all know orangutans do n't live in Africa ; after all , the classic Tarzan movies all used Indian elephants , did they not ? Also , you have to admit that Bo Derek is pretty in face and form . ( But in that case why the hell did n't she just make a career as an art model ? What does it say about a movie when it becomes plain boring to look at a pretty woman ? I actually have n't decided whether it 's a positive or a negative that they never showed her crotch . ) But now I realize : try as I may , I ca n't end on a positive note .   See this film if you 're a bad film buff . I 'm outa here .
pos	This has to be one of the most sincere and touching boy - meets - girl movies ever made . While " Rebel Without a Cause " and " Say Anything " deliver nice portrayals , this movies strips down useless subplots and Hollywood divergences . This movie focuses purely on watching the budding of a beautiful romance . You never doubt for a second that the film will lead towards the romantic pairing of these two people . You almost immediately sense the synergy and the chemistry between Jesse and Celine , and it is simply pure joy to watch them find it . This movie is mostly all dialogue -based . But , every conversation between these too is greatly intriguing . What makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is . How in all that conversation , while often having no real bearing on anything critical , you can sense the nuances as these two become more fond and trusting of each other . This is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone . And what makes it so true is that it is not even too fantastic to believe . This could be what would happen if you had been confident enough to strike up a conversation with that person you noticed somewhere random . And what puts the icing on this film is the magnificent backdrop of Vienna in which this film takes place . It just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests . And no matter how many times I watch this film , I do n't think I will ever tire of that .
neg	The complaints are valid , to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women . I am okay with these night time soaps , like Grey 's Anatomy , or Ugly Betty , or West Wing , because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end . However , when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men ( Taye Diggs , Tim Daly , and Chris Lowell ) into sexual tension and romps , and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so - called little hospital , it seems like General Hospital ... or a female counterpart to Baywatch . That was what men wanted and they had it , so if this is what women want so be it , but the idea that this is a high brow show ( or something men will watch ) is unrealistic .
pos	Clint Eastwood has definitely produced better movies than this , but this one does not embarrass him . Dirty Harry catches everyone 's attention and unless one wants to watch romance , there is no reason why you wo n't like him . He is cool because he is dirty , is great because he kills without much thinking , is perfect because he gets the bullet right through your heart and a hero because he does n't care . From what I have seen in movies in which Eastwood acts , the character of the lead role always captivates the audience . In White Hunter Black heart , he is the crazy director , in " in the Line of Fire " he is the " Old ' un " while here is the " almost " jobless with his job , that is to say he makes work for himself , does n't care one damn about his superiors who practically send him out for a vacation . Based on a rape victim , this movie is promising for all the " no non - sense " movie watchers . The movie has nothing that goes away from he central plot . However , what makes it slightly inferior to the better movies of Eastwood is that though the character of the lead role is captivating the plot is not , as it is far too obvious from the beginning . It is not a movie that is going to make you sit at a place without moving . Also , there are too many people far dirtier than Dirty harry .
neg	Dave is going through a divorce and his mind wanders back to his first love . " Wanders " is probably not the word . I should say he fixates on the past girlfriend . He recalls to the day when the relationship ended . The dream sequences only lack the hazy transitions . He fondly recalls their favorite songs and places they went . I 'm not a counselor , but maybe this had something to do with the failed marriage ? ? ? ? Dave goes to a support group and meets up with a lady half his age ( also divorced ) who , instead of being " turned off " by his creepiness , starts to become interested in him . Did I mention how creepy Dave is ? He sometimes refers to himself in the third person . He does n't move his arms when he walks , either . It 's just weird . Too make a long story short , Dave plots to hunt down Mary ( the old gal friend ) and kill her ... err ... I mean confront her . He does so . Which was really creepy . He believes her to be married , yet he STILL flies half - way across the country to meet her . He stakes out her house to make sure she is alone , before he " drops in " on her . He has an awkward conversation with her that ends with his sharing the gospel of Christ in about 10 words or less , and flies back to the new young girlfriend . We enjoyed the movie mostly for unintentional comedic value . I am still entertaining the wife with my Dave impressions .... "I heard another Dave & Mary song ! "
pos	Somebody mastered the difficult task of merging sports with romance . In reality , sports and romance go together like oil and water . So , to successfully put the two together on screen ... well , that is about the equivalent of splitting the atom . I never thought it could be done . I will be the first to say that in general I do n't like romantic comedies ... but I do like sports and most movies about sports . This movie was a pretty good mix of the two . Being a baseball fan , I could really appreciate the comedic ordeal with Ben Wrightman ( Jimmy Falon ) being a rabid Boston Redsox fan . Anyone who knows anything about baseball knows the curse of the Babe that plagued the Redsox for 86 years , and they know just how nuts about baseball a lot of Redsox fans are . The Farrely brothers did a great job capturing that and it made for good comedy . This was a very good movie that could appeal to many .
neg	This British - Spanish co - production is one of the countless films shot in Spain in the wake of the unexpected phenomenal success enjoyed by the Italian " Spaghetti " Westerns and , as is typical of such genre efforts , features an eclectic assortment of established and emerging international stars : Robert Shaw , Telly Savalas , Stella Stevens , Martin Landau , Fernando Rey , Michael Craig , Al Lettieri , Dudley Sutton , Antonio Mayans , etc . Ironically , however , this incoherent mess of a movie serves as a shining example as to why that most American of film genres became a dying breed in the 1970s and is nowadays practically ( or is that officially ? ) extinct . I really wanted to like this film , not only because the Western is one of my favorite types of movies but also because it had all the qualities , including an intriguing premise , to be a good one - not to mention the fact that my father had purchased a paperback edition of A TOWN CALLED BASTARD 's novelization following its original release ! As it is , the film 's sole virtue ( if , indeed , it can even be called that ) is its sheer eccentricity : for instance , Stevens , playing a widow out for revenge on the man who betrayed her revolutionary husband , sleeps inside a coffin ( ! ) driven around in a carriage by her dumb manservant ( ? ) Sutton ; Savalas , as a blood - thirsty renegade , who at first appears to be the film 's main villain , is unceremoniously dispatched by his own henchman Lettieri very early on in the picture ; the villain of the piece , then , turns out to be Landau who , in the film 's very first scene , is seen pillaging side - by - side our legendary hero - turned - priest Shaw ! ; Fernando Rey , playing a blind peasant , is the only one who can identify rebel Shaw who , in the end turns out to have been merely a front for ... well , nevermind ! As you can see , the plot is very confusing and it gets stranger from there ! The production team responsible for this film were also behind other Western fare around the same period of time , like CUSTER OF THE WEST ( 1967 ) , BAD MAN 'S RIVER ( 1971 ) , CAPTAIN APACHE ( 1971 ) and PANCHO VILLA ( 1972 ) .
pos	I took a chance on " Hardcastle and McCormick " by purchasing the first season 's worth ( Canadian release ) from Amazon . When I got it , I started with the pilot , and I was instantly hooked after that . I rated it 5 stars on Amazon , and I am rating it 10 stars here . It is just that good . What I liked about it were the opening and closing themes , and of course Stephen J. Cannell 's logo at the end of each episode , but most of all , the relationship between the Judge and Mark as they worked together to crack each case . I was so hooked that I also purchased the second season as a companion , and I enjoyed it equally . If you do not have this excellent series on disc , I believe that you should purchase it and put it in your collection .
neg	As usual , on IMDb , going by the majority vote instead of the " weighted average " is far more indicative of the movie 's entertainment value . In this case , the majority gives it a " one " . How right they are ! To start my review , I 'll first admit that I am completely clueless as to why this movie is titled " Alien Intruder " . It does involve space and even an " alien " ( I suppose ) , but there 's no rhyme or reason ( at all ) for anything in the long run , at least , no actual plot basis or resolution that I can make out anywhere . There are quite a few scenes that are so atrocious ( with regard to both the lines , the timing , and how they are spoken ) , that it far exceeds the weird feeling you get when watching similar really bad movies . I have no idea about that part near the beginning where an electronic Bugs Bunny seems to be ranting about something . The " plot " solely involves an area of space known as the G - Spot , sorry , make that G - Sector ... and a virtual reality program infected with some sort of alien ( ? ) virus . I think it is alien since the image of the otherwise normal Ariel appears as a photographic negative . For most of the movie , we see people getting shot with space weapons , falling out of lofts , and seemingly endless , pointless close shots of " Where 's Ariel ? " , " Ca n't find Ariel " ( pointless because most of the other shots INCLUDE interaction with Ariel , anyway - whatever ) on a computer monitor . Commander Skyler ( Billy Dee ) , sits and watches each fantasy of the convict 's VR programs hoping to find this Alien virus and become one with it ... ? ? ? Or maybe I missed something ... Billy Dee Williams took a few courses on " how to act in despair " prior to the filming of this . We know this because he spends a lot of time moving his fingers down over his face and looking mournful . The docking scene with the nose of one ship going into the rear of the other was semi - hilarious at least , and provided for a laugh in addition to the early scenes where we see several shots of the ship as it is just spinning in a circle , looking much like a Lego experiment gone awry . It seems everyone dies in this movie , so why bother ? Even the VR females get killed , as if that is supposed to mean anything ( especially since everyone else dies anyway) ... outrageous . Because of the money I save on groceries , I wo n't rant about wanting my money back that I paid for the DVD of this . The dollar that I saved on that bag of vanilla wafers paid for this reviewer 's time . I 'll just add that the story itself , at least as a novel , and with far more detail added , could probably be quite interesting with the right author . 1/10
pos	` An Itch In Time ' is one of a string of home runs Bob Clampett hit for WB in the early 1940s , including ` Horton Hatches The Egg ' and ` Tortoise Wins By A Hare . ' Soaked in manic timing and exaggerated mayhem , it 's basically the saga of a flea who 's busy breaking ground for a new home , and the dog whose ground is being broken . Because master Elmer will give him a dreaded flea bath if he so much as scratches , the unlucky canine is forced to endure an upward spiral of torment as the homesteading flea uses pick - axes and power tools to clear the ` land . ' Ultimately , the little monster lights the fuse to a small mountain of high explosives he 's piled onto his victim 's backside ! There 's a tremendous explosion , and the hapless pooch covers his eyes as his rear end erupts in a blazing Fourth of July display ! That really has to hurt , and the dog takes flight , but soon he stops the action and says with a merry smile , ` You guys better cut it out , 'cause I think I 'm starting to like it ! ' For years this kinky confession was censored , but current prints have restored the clip , so now viewers can enjoy it in its original devilish glory . Still cut , however , is the closing gag in which the cat blows his brains out after he laments , ` Now I 've seen everything ! ' This was a common gag at WB , but it has since been purged from this cartoon and several others , including ` Horton . '
neg	All I can say after watching Snitch'd is please stop Mr. Cahill . It is painfully clear you have no understanding of what you make movies about . If you insist on making movies about gangsters I urge you to do research . It 's comical to watch movies with absurd gangbangers that even sound more absurd when they speak . I laughed at the part when Mr. Cahill goes to a school with only 3 students and proceeds to kick their butts in kung fu fashion . This movie was tough as an after school special . Who had the idea to have hats worn that say where a particular gangbanger was from ? . I suspect real gangbangers do not wear hats claiming there gang . That would be stupid considering new laws that add length to a prison term if a person is gang related .   Snitch'd is the WORST gangbanger movie ever made .
pos	After erasing my thoughts nearly twenty - seven times , there is a feeling that I can now conquer this review for the complex French drama , " Read My Lips " . Having written over five hundred reviews , I have never found myself at such a loss of words as I did with director Jacques Audiard 's subtle , yet inspirational love story . Thought was poured over what was loved and hated about this film , and while the " loves " overpowered , it was the elements that were hated that sparked further debate within my mind . " Read My Lips " is a drama . To be more precise , is a character driven drama which fuses social uncertainty with crime lords with the doldrums of everyday office work . Here is where this review begins to crumble , it is all of these items  but it is more  much , much more . As a viewer , you are pulled in instantly by Emmanuelle Devos ' portrayal of this fragile woman named Carla , whose strength is lost to the males in her office as well as her hearing difficulty . Audiard introduces us harshly to her world by removing sound from the screen whenever she is not wearing her aid , causing an immediate unrest , not only from the characters within the film , but to those watching . Without sound , the world is left open to any possibility , and that is frightening . As we watch this difficult and unsettling woman setting into her life , we are then uprooted and given the opportunity to meet Paul ( played exquisitely by Vincent Cassel ) , a slicked - back hair , mustache - wearing lanky man who was just released from prison , homeless , jobless , and forced by his parole officer to get a job . This is how Carla and Paul meet . There is that moment of instant , unsettling attraction . The one where we think she loves him , but he is dark ( and here is where it gets even more fun )  and where we think he loves her , but she is dark . The constant role reversal creates the tone of the unknown . Who , as viewers , are we to feel the most sympathy for ? Paul sleeps in the office , Carla helps him ; Carla looses a contract to a rival co - worker , Paul helps her ; Carla 's ability to read people 's lips comes in handy for a make - shift idea for Paul . The continual jumps back and forth keep you on your chair , waiting for the possibility of some light to shine through this dark cave . It never does . Audiard can not just allow this story to take place , he continually introduces us to more characters ; one just as seedy as the next . Even our rock , our solid foundation with the parole officer is in question when his wife goes missing  a subplot to this film that at first angered me , but upon further debate was a staple finale for this film . Yet none of this could have happened if it were n't for our characters . Devos ' solemn and homely look is breathtaking , as she changes her image for Paul ; the truth of her beauty is discovered . Paul , the wildcard in the film , continues to seemingly use and abuse the friendship for his final endgame . Then , just as we assume one , Carla takes on one last shape . Audiard knows he has amazing actors capturing his characters . Cassel and Devos could just play cards the entire time and I would still be sitting at the end of my chair . The story , probably the weakest part of this film , is at first random . The interwoven stories seem unconnected at first , but Audiard lets them connect bit by bit . Again , the entire parole officer segment was tangent , but that final scene just solidified the ends to the means . Not attempting to sound vague , but this complex ( yet utterly simple ) story is difficult to explain . There is plenty happening , but it is up to you to connect the pieces . A favorite scene is when Carla is attempting to discover where some money is being held . That use of sound and scene was brilliant . It was tense , it was dramatic , and it was like watching a who - dun - it mystery unfold before your eyes . Overall , I initially though this was a mediocre French film that I could easily forget about when it was over  I was proved wrong . " Read My Lips " opens the floor for discussion , not just with the characters , but the situations . One will find themselves rooting for Carla in one scene , and Paul in the next . When a discovery is made in Paul 's apartment by Carla , I found myself deeply angry . Audiard brought true emotion to the screen with his characters and development , and what he was lacking in plot  the actors were able to carry . I can easily suggest this film to anyone , but be prepared ; this is n't a one time viewing film . Repeat . Repeat . Repeat . Grade : * * * * out of * * * * *
neg	Well it looked good on paper , Nick Cage and Jerry Buckheimer collaborate again , this time on a mix of heist movie , Da Vinci Code , American History 101 and Indiana Jones . But oh dear , this is to Indiana Jones what Speed 2 is to Speed . A reasonable cast(including John Voight and Harvey Keitel ) battles against a puerile script and loses badly . The film is little more than an extended advert for the Freemasons . However these Freemasons are not your usual shopkeepers who use funny handshakes and play golf , these Freemasons are the natural descendants of the Knights Templar ( and nobody mention ' From Hell ' or Jack the Ripper.)I do n't think I 've revealed any plot spoilers because there are none . There is virtually no suspense , no surprises and no climax- it just stops . National Treasure aims for Dan Brown but hits the same intellectual level as an episode of Scooby Doo sans the humour .
pos	All i hear about is how poorly the animation is done . It may not be up to par with what everyone expects , but look at it this way . Would you expect perfection in hell ? It is my belief that the animation was made dry and gritty on purpose . It was great to see her character transformation in this movie , considering it will probably be as close to live action as we will ever get . I hope for a sequel very soon . If we want live action , i think we may be better off with Chastity or Purgatori . I do n't think Lady Death would transfer well to film . But be that as it may , It is my own personal belief that all the naysayers about this movie are DEAD wrong . No pun intended .
neg	I actually did n't enjoy this movie . I saw it at a camp , and we did n't rave about it , we laughed at it . Sure , some parts are touching , but the acting is terrible , the effects are terrible , and the whole overall movie idea is terrible ( now , I know it was based on a book which I have n't read , but I hope that the book was better than this , because frankly , I thought that this movie was very bad and boring ) . Like I said , I went to it with a bunch of people from a camp , and we were excited to be there , plus I got a caffeinated drink , but nonetheless , I struggled to stay awake . The only thing that kept me up ( other than my fear of being embarrassed once I woke up ) was the gunshots , that were quite pointless as well . I just really did n't like it .
pos	Another small piece of the vast picture puzzle of the Holocaust is turned face up in this docudrama about the Rosenstrasse Protest in Berlin , an event I had not known of , that began in late February , 1943 . The details are given in an addendum that follows this review . The film narrative sets the story of this protest within another , contemporary story that begins in New York City , in the present . Here a well off , non - observant Jewish woman , whose husband has just died , shocks her children and others by insisting on an extremely orthodox mourning ritual . She goes even further , demanding that her daughter 's non - Jewish fiancé leave the house . The distressed daughter , Hannah ( Maria Schrader ) then learns for the first time from an older cousin that during WWII , in Berlin , her mother , then 8 years old , had been taken in and protected by an Aryan woman . Hannah drops everything , goes to Berlin , and finds this woman , Lena Fischer , now 90 . Hannah easily persuades the woman to tell her story . It all seems rather too pat . The film thereafter improves , focusing through long flashbacks primarily on the events of 1943 that surrounded the protest , in which the fictitious central character is the same Mrs. Fischer at 33 ( played magnificently by Katja Riemann ) , a Baroness and accomplished pianist who is married to Fabian ( Martin Feifel ) , a Jewish concert violinist , one of the men detained at the Rosenstrasse site . The narrative does briefly weave back to the present from time to time and also ends in New York City once again . While scenes in the present are color saturated , the 1943 scenes are washed out , strong on blue - gray tones . The quality of acting is generally quite good , what we might expect given the deep reservoir of talent in Germany and the direction of Margarethe von Trotta , New German Cinema 's most prominent female filmmaker , herself a former actress . The story of the protest is told simply . Only one feature is lacking that would have helped : still - text notes at the end indicating the eventual outcome for those people taken into custody at Rosenstrasse , an outcome that was , as the addendum below makes clear , incredibly positive . " Rosenstrasse " has not fared well in the opinions of most film critics . Overly long , needlessly layered , purveyor of gender stereotypes , manipulative with music : so go the usual raps . It is too long . But I found in this film an austere , powerful , spontaneous and entirely convincing voice of protest from the women who kept the vigil outside the place on Rosenstrasse where their Jewish relatives and others were detained . I found nothing flashy , contemporary or manipulative in this depiction . The very absence of extreme violence ( no one is shot or otherwise physically brutalized ) intensified my tension , which increased incrementally as the film progressed . You keep waiting for some vicious attack to begin any minute . The somberness of the film stayed with me afterward . I awoke often later in the night I saw the film , my mind filled with bleak , melancholic , chaotic images and feelings conjured by the film . For me , that happens rarely . ( In German and English ) . My rating : 8/10 ( B+ ) . ( Seen on 05/31/05 ) . If you 'd like to read more of my reviews , send me a message for directions to my websites . Add : The Rosenstrasse Protest : Swept up from their forced labor jobs in what was meant to be the Final Roundup in the national capital , 1700 to 2000 Jews , mostly men married to non - Jewish women , were herded into Rosenstrasse 2 - 4 , a welfare office for the Jewish community in central Berlin . Because these Jews had German relatives , many of them highly connected , Adolf Eichmann hoped that segregating them from other prisoners would convince family members that their loved ones were being sent to labor camps rather than to more ominous destinations in occupied Poland . Normally , those arrested remained in custody for only two days before being loaded onto trains bound for the East . But before deportation of prisoners could occur in this case , wives and other relatives got wind of what was happening and appeared at the Rosenstrasse address , first in ones and twos , and then in ever - growing numbers . Perhaps as many as six thousand participated in the protest , although not all at the same time . Women demanded back their husbands , day after day , for a week . Unarmed , unorganized , and leaderless , they faced down the most brutal forces at the disposal of the Third Reich . Joseph Goebbels , the Gauleiter ( governor or district leader ) of Berlin , anxious to have that city racially cleansed , was also in charge of the nation 's public morale . On both counts he was worried about the possible repercussions of the women 's actions . Rather than inviting more open dissent by shooting the women down in the streets and fearful of jeopardizing the secrecy of the " Final Solution , " Goebbels with Hitler 's concurrence released the Rosenstrasse prisoners and even ordered the return of twenty - five of them who already had been sent to Auschwitz !   To both Hitler and Goebbels , the decision was a mere postponement of the inevitable . But they were mistaken . Almost all of those released from Rosenstrasse survived the war . The women won an astonishing victory over the forces of destruction . ( Adapted from an article posted at the University of South Florida website , " A Teacher 's Guide to the Holocaust . " )
neg	I thought I had seen this movie , twice in fact . Then I read all the other reviews , and they did n't quite match up . A man and three young students , two girls and a boy , go to this town to study alleged bigfoot sightings . I still feel pretty confident that this is the movie I saw , despite the discrepancies in the reviews . Therefore I 'm putting my review back : If you like the occasional ' B ' movie , as I do , then Return to Boggy Creek is the movie for you ! Whether it 's setting the sleep timer , and nodding off to your favorite movie - bomb , or just hanging out with friends . Boggy Creek , the mute button , and you 've got a fun night of improv . Look out ! Is the legend true ? I think we just might find out , along with a not - so - stellar cast . Will there be any equipment malfunctions at particularly key moments in the film ? Does our blonde , manly , young hero have any chest hair ? Will the exceptionally high - tech Technicolor last the entire film ? You 'll have to watch to find out for yourself .
pos	A very refreshing story , the life of a parrot with an intellect higher than an average human 's . Shows humans from a bird 's point of view . Especially liked the portrayal of different types of characters that the bird spends time with . Not all birds are bird - brained ...
neg	I only rented this because i loved the first movie . However , calling it John Carpenters Vampires : Los Muertos is just a con trick to get you to rent it . He is in fact executive producer and clearly had nothing to do with the making of this film ( Jeepers Creepers Anyone ? ) A tragic storyline , terrible special effects and Jon Bon Jovi as the least convincing Vampire Hunter of all time . It 's not even comically bad . What we end up with is a dull , uninvolving film with a terrible script and indefinsibly bad and clichéd acting . It just reeks of low budget . Avoid like the Bubonic plague .
pos	I 'm not much of an expert on acting or other movie details , but this movie just hit me deep . I do n't think I 'll ever forget it . One scene especially ( I think that anybody who has seen the film will know of which one I am speaking ) is imprinted on my brain . I also watched the similar movie Lilja 4-ever ( as referred to by a previous commentator ) . It was also very moving , but not quite as straight to the point and brutal . If you are sensitive at all , either will bring tears to your eyes , but Anjos Do Sol ( Angels of the Sun ) may stay with you forever . This is very depressing subject matter , but I think , no , I HOPE that the film succeeds in bringing more attention to it . More people need to see this film ! ! ! ! ! !
neg	Annie Potts is the only highlight in this truly dull film . Mark Hamill plays a teenager who is really really really upset that someone stole the Corvette he and his classmates turned into a hotrod ( quite possibly the ugliest looking car to be featured in a movie ) , and heads off to Las Vegas with Annie to track down the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joy . I would have plucked out my eyes after watching this if it was n't for the fun of watching Annie Potts in a very early role , and it 's too bad for Hamill that he did n't take a few acting lessons from her . Danny Bonaduce also makes a goofy cameo .
pos	Imagine being so hampered by a bureaucracy that a one man spends 8 year 's of his life , and has a mental breakdown trying to solve a mass murder case virtually by himself ! The murder technique is clear , but a government unwilling to admit the truth let 's a monster destroy dozens of lives . When I think my job is stressful , I merely remember the true story behind this wonder flick . The devotion to duty of the main character was masterfully portrayed by Rea . The comic ( and almost tragic at times ) relationship between Rea and the Sutherland character made this one of my favorite movies of the last 5 years . The catching of one of the worst mass murderers in history had me on the edge of my seat . While not nearly as well advertised and talked about as " Silence of the Lamb 's " , the plot was just as suspenseful . Rent or buy this movie today !
neg	I love B movies .. but come on .... this was n't even worth a grade ... The ending was dumb ... b / c THERE WAS NO REAL ENDING!!! .. not to mention that it comes to life on its own ... I mean no lighting storm or crazy demonic powers ? ? Slow as hell and then they just start killing off the characters one by one in like a 15 min time period ... and i wo n't even start on the part of the thing killing the one guy without its head .... and then you do n't even get to see what Jigsaw even does with his so called " new jigsaw puzzle" .... Unless you have nothing better to do ... Id watch paint dry before I d recommend this God - forsaken movie to anyone else ... oh and to make it even better the other movie totem you can see the guy throwing the one creature in the basement scene from the window .. that was funny as hell and probably the only good part of watching that waste of film
pos	Cary Grant , Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor McLaglen are three soldiers in 19th Century India who , with the help of a water boy ( Sam Jaffe ) rid the area of the murderous thuggee cult . The chemistry between the actors helps make this one of the most entertaining movies of all time . Sam Jaffe is exceptional as the outcast water boy who is mistreated by all and still wants to be accepted as a soldier in the company . Loosely based on Rudyard Kipling 's poem . A must see by anyone who enjoys this type of movie .
neg	First of all , this movie is n't a complete disaster . If you had never heard of the real story of Gram Parsons then it might seem a reasonably entertaining diversion . Johnny Knoxville ca n't really be criticised for his performance as Phil Kaufman - he 's pretty good at looking laid - back and down to earth and you can sort of root for his long - suffering everyman . Michael Shannon is due credit for pretty much the same reasons , except he 's a hippy stoner . There are some good individual comedic scenes - the hippy - hearse crashing into the airport hanger door stands out . But that 's where the good things end , and we begin to see the aspects that make this movie so truly disappointing . The character of Robert Forster as Gram 's actual father is an invention so disgraceful as to cast a taint over the entire film . We all know his real father committed suicide when he was young - something that could surely be compared to Gram 's life on the edge by a better film - maker . Having Forster as his supposed real father , and not his step - father would be bad enough , if not for the well known difficulties Gram had with the man who actually flew to collect his body . It has been suggested that his step father had admitted to providing Gram 's mother with alcohol as she lay dying and that this enraged Gram when he later found out about it . Also the controversy over where Gram 's body was buried would surely be reason enough not to invent a benevolent made - up father who actually catches up to the duo and their hearse , but then allows them to go ahead with the burning . Whatever the truth about the man who Gram got the name Parsons from , he certainly bore no resemblance to Forster 's character here , and it is hard to see why this role was written . Then there 's the addition of Christina Applegate as a greedy chick ( yet very pretty of course ) who wants Gram 's body back so that she can begin to cash in on his estate . Her character , and her acting are non - existent and one wonders why the director did n't just go the whole hog and include a lesbo scene between her and the chick who plays Kaufman 's girlfriend(it would n't have lowered the tone a whole lot more ) . When you think of the ingredients that could have been used in a good movie about Parsons , the shortcomings of this film are easily apparent . Country music being changed by a young , polite , southern gentleman - who was also long haired , drug loving , popular with the ladies and ultimately self destructive . Real events like the hanger door crash and the painted hearse and friends like Keith Richards . Instead of these things we have to concentrate wholly on Kaufman 's input into Gram 's life . Kaufman is obviously still lapping up the cult status he received for what he did ( he certainly is a little cult ) . From interviews it is obvious that he 's delighted with the attention . Remember this is the man who made a remark about the genitalia of the naked corpse of Gram Parsons as he was preparing to set it alight . What he did was not an act of great loyalty , but a doped up alcoholic escapade . Looking at Knoxville and the director in interviews , a few things become clear also . It 's obvious that they have no real grasp of the story of Gram 's life , nor do they wish to have . They want a hit movie about an event that is infamous and crazy . It was an amazing life with a strange end . That the end is the only thing covered by this movie shows how limited an understanding of Gram Parsons the makers had .
pos	This is not Bela Lagosi 's best movie , but it 's got a good old style approach for some 40 's horror entertainment . Brides are dropping dead at the altar like flies . I think I 'd postpone the wedding until after the fiend is caught , but it 's a horror movie , so I guess people ignore the danger for some reason . Anyway , Lagosi is a mad doctor , who needs young female blood to keep his aging , sickly wife healthy and happy . He always eludes the Keystone Cops by hiding the bodies in a hearse ( who would think of looking for a corpse in a hearse ? ) , and the brides just keep on getting zapped . No movie like this would be complete without a Lois Lane type female reporter who wants to catch the criminal on her own . Good at solving crime , bad at keeping her mouth shut at all the wrong times , guess who Lagosi picks for his next intended victim . I love the " haunted house " bit where Lois Lane gets stranded by a thunderstorm as a guest at Lagosi 's sinister mansion . Hidden passageways , a vampire - like wife , an evil dwarf Igor assistant , and so on . Good stuff . Fairly well done pacing keeps the film moving , and the story resolves itself in a typical but satisfying manner . If you like old horror movies , this one is worth a watch .
neg	Fairly good movie , but not a true story . Rubin " Hurricane " Carter was a notorius liar , a murder and was never found not guilty . New Jersey State just did n't go for it a third time as 20 years had gone . Carter got an offer in 1976 : " Pass a lie test and go free " . He did n't take it . This film should never have been made , but money talks . A lot of people have unjustly spend their lives in prison and undoubtedly more blacks than white . Why choose a fake story ? Jens
pos	This one 's a romp ; many Trek fans do n't rate this as high as the well - known all - time classic episodes because it lacks the deep meaning or undertone of those really great ones , but this one is so well executed for what it is , so successful as pure entertainment , it always makes my personal list of the top half dozen episodes , no matter what mood I 'm in . Several well known future movies ( " Westworld " ) and TV shows ( the more bland " Fantasy Island " ) took their cue from the premise of this episode ( then , of course , the TNG show revamped the concept with the holodeck technology ) . Beautifully filmed ( especially evident in the restored version and on DVD ) and directed , it takes place in the nice park - like setting of a planet which the Enterprise has just arrived to . It 's odd that no animal life , even insects , seems to exist here ( how are flowers pollinated , for example ) , but things turn really odd when members of the landing party start seeing people from their past ( Kirk has a people - heavy past , it turns out ) , as well as figures from other well - known fantasy stories . Sulu even finds an old - style police revolver ( adding to his collection of swords , no doubt ) . By this point in the Trek series ( halfway thru the first season ) , the main characters had pretty much solidified into the old friends we 'd come to know over the many proceeding years . Here , we get to really see them relax , converse and work together to figure out this episode 's puzzle : the strong narrative is a mystery again , of sorts , and the audience is along for the ride as Kirk & friends seek to unravel a very bizarre series of events which have a decidedly amusing flavor to them . It 's almost whimsical , following up on the carefree style established up on the starship as Kirk was finally maneuvered into beaming down after showing definite signs of stress and fatigue ( the Enterprise had , it 's suggested , just completed a harrowing mission ) . Then Dr. McCoy is killed by a knight on horseback ; yes , this is Dr. McCoy 's final episode ... just kidding . But , it 's no joke to the rest of the landing party at this point in the story . McCoy really is dead for all intents and purposes and , like the best Trek episodes , the 2nd half of this adventure escalates to a more frantic , more desperate tempo of action and suspense . This is all signaled by Kirk 's resolute response to Sulu , who voices his lack of understanding about any of these events just after McCoy 's death - Kirk will get to the bottom of all this , come what may . But , it does n't get much easier for Kirk : what follows is probably the longest staged mano - a - mano fight for the series as Kirk tussles with his nemesis from his academy days , a struggle that seems to take place over half the planet . Yet , this is counterbalanced by scenes of extraordinary tenderness , with another of Kirk 's past acquaintances . This episode runs the gamut of all human experience , rather fitting in light of what we learn about the actual purpose of this weird planet . It 's gratifying that the script really does explain all of what 's happened , as opposed to some nonsensical approach which permeates many other fantasy & sci - fi series with similar plot lines ( unexplained appearances by persons who could not possibly be there ) . And there actually is a subtext to the story - that we humans need to ' work ' off our tensions and fatigue in a particular fashion , or we just do n't function in a ' normal ' natural way . Also , note the appearance of the very cute Yeoman Barrows and the sudden absence of Yeoman Rand , who did not return until the first Trek movie in ' 79 . I believe that after this episode , even more Trek fans could n't wait for the next appearance of all their favorite characters . But I leave this episode with a final , perhaps tantalizing thought : if McCoy was killed ( verified by Spock ) , how do we know it was our real McCoy who beamed back up to the ship ? Perhaps this explains why this McCoy was still inspecting starships about a century later and getting along very well with Data .
neg	OK , plain and simple , if you are a fan of the other Tomb Raider games ( yes , even AOD ) KEEP AWAY FROM LEGEND . It is , without doubt , the most disappointing TR game yet . It looks very nice , it sounds very nice , but it is totally unplayable and I 've given up . I feel like I 've been robbed by Eidos . It 's very simple . TR was a PC game before anything else . You control Lara using the keyboard . In 6 Tomb Raider games the controls were standard . In AOD they were ' tacky ' , but still the same general control sequences . In Legend they have changed her movement and control methods completely and she is totally uncontrollable . I have seen comments elsewhere from people who say ' Use the mouse ' . No , why should I ? Others say ' Use a gamepad ' . No , why should I ? Others say ' But this has been the standard for 3rd person controls for years ' Well , I do n't care , it is not the standard for any other TR game so why mess with it . Oh , I know , because they could n't care less about their original , loyal fan base , they want to cash in on the new kids who had n't even heard of the series until the movies came out and make lots more money . Pathetic . My advice to any serious TR fan is keep away from this game , and if you do buy it complain to Eidos . I have seen masses of other posts , mainly on the Eidos forums , from people telling them how rubbish it is , perhaps they will listen .
pos	But the opposite , sorry bud , i completely understand how you can be dragged into a film because you relate to the subject ( and you have ) . This film is terrible , the main character would give any charlie brown subtitler a run for his money he just constantly mumbles which is always a laugh , most scenes just feel awkward with characters more often than not gazing across to another with a look of ... its your line now , then i will react . Best British comedy ? Please buddy , have a strong word with your bad bad self ... at the end of the day ... the sun goes down ... and this film is Awful . I mean well done to the people involved ... they have made a film ... and maybe motorbike enthusiasts may be into it but people that still live here on earth with an actual sense of humour will struggle with this more than smiling at the Christmas present they 're nan bought them ... was that overly harsh ? i do apologise ...
neg	I am a Christian ... and I feel this movie is awful . Nobody but hard - core , Bible - belt Christians are going to like this movie . The message is just too in your face . If you want to touch a wider audience , you have to be way more subtle . You ca n't have the dad waving the bible around and carrying it with him in EVERY scene . RIDICULOUS !   Poor direction . The reveal of people missing should have been terrifying , but it was laughable . They leave their clothes on the ground ? It reminded me of old Ed Wood movies : " Oh my God ! People are missing ! " That scene in the plane is just stupid . Think about it : if you found your relative 's clothes next to you , you would n't just scream " oh my god . they disappeared ! they 're missing ! " and start crying and yelling . You would first be in denial ... you just would n't jump to that conclusion . Watch Jodie Foster in FLIGHTPLAN . My favorite shot is the dog sitting out on the lawn with a pile of clothes and boots sitting next to him . I about fell off the couch I was laughing so hard . The music was so bad and so distracting . It was as if the composer was in his own world scoring his own movies . " here 's my chance to do a thriller " , " here 's my chance to do action ! " STOP TELLING ME HOW TO FEEL JAMES COVELL ! A good score supports what 's happening on the screen ... this movie needed more of an UNDER score , but instead it was as much in your face as the message was . The writing was bland . So was Captain Christian Kirk Cameron . Chelsea was the worse : " you do n't understand ! People are missing ! " . Brad Johnson was laughable . The two stand out performances came from the Anti - Christ and the older guy ( sorry , ca n't remember their names ) In watching the " making of " ( to answer my question of " what were they thinking ? ? ? " ) , the producers and filmmakers and actors are just deluding themselves ... saying " we 're gon na reach wide audiences " and " brad Johnson is amazing " and " this is just like a Hollywood movie " . I came to the conclusion that they just do n't know what the " heck " they are doing . I commend the effort . Getting the message to a wide audience is a fantastic idea . Film is the best medium possible to do that . Look at movies like WIDE AWAKE , SIGNS , CONTACT , PASSION OF Christ , even O'BROTHER , WHERE ART THOU ? The bottom line is that the film needed to be made by people who have talent and vision . Unfortunately , it was not .
pos	This is a lovely tale of guilt - driven obsession . Matiss , on a lonely night stroll in Riga ( ? ) passes by a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing . He passes by without a word . Only the splash in the water followed by a cry for help causes him to act . And then only too little and too late . The film chronicles his efforts at finding out more about the woman . On a troll of local bars , he finds her pocketbook . He pieces more and more of her life together . His " look " changes as his obsession grows . He has to make things right . In a marvelously filmed dialog with the " bastard ex - boyfriend " he forces Alexej to face up to the guilt that both feel . Haunting long takes , a gritty soundtrack to accentuate the guilt , barking dogs . Footsteps . Lovely film noir with a lovely twist . A good Indie ending .
neg	Schlocky ' 70s horror films ... ya got ta love 'em . In contrast to today 's boring slasher flicks , these K - tel specials actually do something scary and do not resort to a tired formula . This is a B movie about the making of a B movie ... that went horribly wrong . Faith Domergue ( This Island Earth ) stars as an over - the - hill , B movie queen making a movie about a series of grisly murders that befell a family in their home . Her boyfriend / director , who looks and acts like Gordon Jump with an attitude , is filming on location and on a tight schedule . The Ken doll co - star discovers a book of Tibetian chants that they work into the script to add " realism " . Unfortunately , " realism " is something they could have done without . John Carradine , having long since given up looking for the 17th gland ( The Unearthly ) , now eeks out a humble existence as the caretaker for the estate . He goes about his daily work , but always seems to run afoul of the director . The horror builds slowly ; a dead cat here , John Carradine entering a grave there , finally culminating in seven , yes seven murders . ( At least there 's truth in advertising . ) It 's just sad that the ghoul did n't understand that there was a movie being made above him . How was poor Faith to know that those darn Tibetian chants would actually work ? Face it , you just ca n't go around tugging on Satan 's coat and expect him to take it lying down . Sterno says perform an autopsy on The House of Seven Corpses .
pos	Although this was obviously a low - budget production , the performances and the songs in this movie are worth seeing . One of Walken 's few musical roles to date . ( he is a marvelous dancer and singer and he demonstrates his acrobatic skills as well - watch for the cartwheel ! ) Also starring Jason Connery . A great children 's story and very likable characters .
neg	Trying to cash in on the success of Deal Or No Deal and 1 Versus 100 comes this lame excuse for entertainment - Show Me The Money , in which 12 sexy ' dancers ' shimmy out in shiny red hooker attire . A contestant is given the beginning of a phrase , such as " Which team lost . . . " with three choices , A , B , or C , each which completes the phrase . The contestant has three chances to give an answer to one of these 3 choices . The host - William Shatner , at his obnoxious smarmiest - asks the contestant if he wants to " lock into the answer " and when the contestant says yes , he picks a ' dancer ' , to whom he yells " Show me the money ! " She opens a scroll that has an amount , and if his answer was right , he adds that amount to his winnings ; if he was wrong , the amount is subtracted . ( So theoretically , it is possible for a contestant on this dreary debacle to actually wind up owing Shatner money . ) There is also a " Killer Card " and if the contestant picks the girl who has that vile scroll , but he has answered properly , nothing happens . If he 's answered wrong , the game goes into Sudden Death and has to answer another question . If he gets that one wrong , he leaves with nothing . Before going to commercials , Shatner yells , " let 's dance " and Shatner , the contestant and the 12 dancers shake booty . At the end of the show , Shatner asks the ladies for " a last dance " and they all shake it some more . I give this show 6 episodes at the very most , at which time hopefully this pathetic excuse for a game will be shown the door . ( It could 've been worse - they could 've somehow bribed Cuba Gooding Jr to be the host , although I bet he 's a better dancer than ' Shat , ' as they call him these days . ) 7/08 : Guess what - I was wrong ! It lasted for only 5 episodes . There IS hope for the world .
pos	Since the title is in English and IMDb lists this show 's primary language as English , i shall concentrate on reviewing the English version of Gundam Wing(2000 ) as presented in the Bandai released DVD set . My actual review for the whole series is under IMDb 's entry of " " Shin kidô senki Gundam W"(1995 ) . Very little is changed in respect to plot , script and characterization its adaptation to English and it really depends on your own taste to choose which language to watch this show in . Purists can stick to Japanese all they want , but for a more " realistic " experience i recommend the English track since all the characters , except Heero Yuy , are not Japanese.(most of them are Caucasian in fact with a couple of non - Japanese Asians . ) For one thing , the characters ' personalities come across more " directly " than in the Japanese version . The contrast between the characters is stronger thanks to some give - or - take performances but a very well cast group of actors . Wing Gundam 's pilot Heero Yuy is a highly trained soldier who suppresses his emotions but slowly learns the value of his humanity . Voiced by Mark Hildreth who 's deadpan delivery can be criticized as " bad acting " but it matches Heero 's personality very well . Deathscythe Gundam 's Duo Maxwell , ever cheerful in the face of death is given a crash course in the cherishing the value of life and friends . He is possibly the best acted character in the whole show , masterfully played by Scott McNeil . He may sound a little too old for his age , but Duo 's English voice easily out ranks his irritatingly nasal Japanese one . Trowa , the pilot of Heavyarms , is a lost lonely soul who 's only purpose so far has been combat ; despite his inner desire to form connections with the people around him , he only knows how to kill , not to befriend . Kirby Morrow gives a somber but realistic performance as Trowa Barton . Quatre Rebarba Winner is voiced by Brad Swaile who has no trouble brining out the caring nature of the character and the shattering of his innocence as he experiences horrors of war and death first hand . A huge plus point is that Quatre no longer sounds like a girl(and yes he is voiced by a female actress in the Japanese version ) but a bona fide typical 15 year old guy . The impulsive but determined Wufei Chang voiced by Ted Cole may seem a little over - the - top but it plays out in stark contrast to the more subdued roles of Heero and Trowa . Relena Darlian sounds older in English , voiced by Lisa Ann Bailey . This might not sit well with her youthful personification early in the series but as her character matures later into the story , her voice follows suit and ends up fitting in very well with the character development . Zechs Merquise would be one of the more drastically changed voices when compared to the Japanese version . Both voices bring out different sides to the same character . His Japanese voice is haughty , authoritative and commands respect , keeping in line with his high ranking status and charismatic nature . His English voice by Brian Drummond is more subdued , sounding more devious and " snake - like " , highlighting Zechs ' secretive nature regarding his hidden agendas and staunch beliefs in his ideals . The members of OZ are a mixed bag really . Treize Kushrenada voiced by David Kaye is given a more realistic and down - to - earth performance compared to his larger - than - life Japanese style of speaking . However , Lady Une does not convey her split personality as contrastingly as in the Japanese version and Lucrencia Noin just sounds ......... bored most of the time . The cannon fodder pilots and military leaders are nothing to speak of either . I would have appreciated if they took the time to give different characters different accents to reflect their ethnic backgrounds . The Maganac Corp 's voices were generally uninspired but could have been more interesting if they were given middle eastern accents . The members of the Romerfeller Foundation would have also sounded better with some classy European accent that reflects their status of nobility . Despite underwhelming acting from the side characters , the main cast manage to carry the show and it results in an overall less over - the - top and more realistic rendition of Gundam Wing 's script . Very faithful to the original Japanese script , keeping all the underlying thought provoking ideas and themes about politics , war and human nature . Sadly , it also retains the flaws of the original Japanese script .
neg	I admit that the majority of this film was uninspired , but i was still entertained . It has a wonderful sense of frenetic energy , above average music , and the women in the film fiercely defend themselves , there 's no prissies here . I can think of dozens of other films that were way worse , at least this one had an intriguing plotline along with some social commentary . They allude to how the military deals with viral epidemics , destroy everything in sight , even if it means the people you 're supposed to be saving . Also , how dangerous martial law can be since at that point democracy ceases to exist . Fulci seemed to attempt to combine his earlier work(zombie , beyond , gates of hell)in an effort to somehow improve on them . He failed , but definitely not miserably , like a number of people would have you think . I have a soft spot for zombie films , so i admit that i 'm somewhat biased when it comes to reviewing them . All i 'm saying is that this movie is good for one time around , if there was n't so much descension in the making of this film(fulci quit and bruno(i can hack with the best of them)mattei took over)it could have been much better and more focused . It 's going to stay in my collection as fulci 's zombie swan song . One surprising note , is that there is a scene in zombie 3 that cemetery man actually ripped off , i could n't believe it myself , check it out you 'll be surprised .
pos	Von Trier once explained how he created such strong involvement from the viewer with his movies by placing his movie world in about the middle of the real world and the imagined world . So as viewers we think we watch a " true " story while in fact we are thoroughly manipulated , often to the point that the movie works disturbing ( Dancer in the Dark ) or painful ( The Idiots/ Idioterne ) . Of course the Dogme - films acted only as a vehicle for this theory ( besides creating some welcome spotlight on Von Trier ) . The story is typical for Von Trier : our hero is idealistic , seems to balance his relations with everybody else , but soon becomes the victim of the problems others have created in the past for themselves . The idealist inevitably has to reject society in order to stay idealistic and becomes the terrorist . Mankind is spoiled and purity only leads to ( self-)destruction . ( These elements were also very omnipresent in Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark . ) The movie is also full of cynical ( even humorous ) undertones about the role of the Germans and Americans in post - war Germany . As a technical achievement the movie is wonderfully designed : shifting and fading washed - out colors , screen overlays , action on different overlays ( with the shooting of the soon - to - be mayor as the most interesting ) . In this movie we can see how good Von Trier 's handles film as a technical medium . In his later works he seems to step down from this ( as if he is not longer interested in technical achievements because they become so easily available ) .
neg	Rating : 4 out of 10 As this mini - series approached , and we were well aware of it for the last six months as Sci - Fi Channel continued to pepper their shows with BG ads , I confess that I felt a growing unease as I learned more . As with any work of cinematic art which has stood up to some test of time , different people go to it to see different things . In this regard , when people think of Battlestar Galactica , they remember different things . For some it is the chromium warriors with the oscillating red light in their visor . For others , it is the fondness that they held for special effects that were quite evolutionary for their time . Many forget the state of special effects during the late 70s , especially those on television . For some the memories resolve around the story arc . Others still remember the relationships how how the relationships themselves helped overcome the challenges that they faced . Frankly , I come from the latter group . The core of Battlestar Galactica was the people that pulled together to save one another from an evil empire . Yes , evil . The Cylons had nothing to gain but the extermination of the human race yet they did it . While base stars were swirling around , men and women came together to face an enemy with virtually unlimited resources , and somehow they managed to survive until the next show . They did n't survive because they had better technology , or more fire power . They survived because they cared for and trusted each other to get through to the next show . The show had its flaws , and at times was sappy , but they were people you could care about . The writers of this current rendition seemed to never understand this . In some ways he took the least significant part of the original show , the character 's names and a take on the story arc and crafted what they called nothing less than a reinvention of television science fiction . Since that was their goal , they can be judged on how well they accomplished it : failure . It was far from a reinvention . In fact it was in many ways one of the most derivitive of science fiction endeavors in a long time . It borrows liberally from ST : TNG , ST : DS9 , Babylon 5 , and even Battlefield Earth . I find that unfortunate . Ronald D. Moore has been a contributor to popular science fiction for more than a decade , and has made contribution to some of the most popular television Science Fiction that you could hope to see . One of the difficulties that he appears to have had was that there could be no conflict in the bridge crew of the Enterprise D & E. That was the inviolable rule of Roddenberry 's ST : TNG . Like many who have lived under that rules of others who then take every opportunity to break the rules when they are no longer under that authority , Ron Moore seems to have forgotten some of the lessons he learned under the acknowledged science fiction master : Gene Roddenberry . Here , instead of writing the best story possible , he has created a dysfuntional cast as I have ever seen with the intent of creating as much cast conflict as he could . Besides being dysfunctional , some of it was not the least bit believable . Anyone who has ever been in the military knows that someone unprovokedly striking a superior officer would not get just a couple of days " in hack , " they could have gotten execution , and they never would have gotten out the next day . It would n't have happened , period , especially in time of war . The thing that I remembered most of Ron Moore 's earlier work was that he was the one who penned the death of Capt . James Kirk . He killed Capt . Kirk , and , alas for me , he has killed Battlestar Galactica .
pos	This is obviously aimed at the same market as Monsters Inc and Shrek , but is different in its less cartoony feel ( despite the deliberately cartoony characteristics of the lead creatures ) . The story is not one that had a massive in your face moral at the end ( its more like its tugging at your shirt sleeves ) but chooses just to tell a story about relationships between different " animals . " You know the outcome , but you ca n't help being drawn in .   The characters themselves are far more than their voices ( the advantage of less famous actors doing the voices ) , unlike most Disney movies . They are well rounded and completely believable , strangely . The group dynamics are brilliantly well presented and the character revelations and quirks are subtle and enjoyable . You will find yourself rooting for them far sooner than you would like to think .   The animation is brilliant , as you would expect , and you will be praying for the opportunity to go on the ice slide in the movie . You will fall in love with the characters , especially the comic relief of the prehistoric squirrel and its desperate attempts to bury its nuts . I came out wanting the obligatory merchandise , especially the sloth toy , only to be disappointed the next day when I could n't find anything vaguely related . Which , strangely , makes the movie all the more pure .   Better than Monsters Inc or Shrek .
neg	If I had not read Pat Barker 's ' Union Street ' before seeing this film , I would have liked it . Unfortuntately this is not the case . It is actually my kind of film , it is well made , and in no way do I want to say otherwise , but as an adaptation , it fails from every angle . The harrowing novel about the reality of living in a northern England working - class area grabbed hold of my heartstrings and refused to let go for weeks after I had finished . I was put through tears , repulsion , shock , anger , sympathy and misery when reading about the women of Union Street . Excellent . A novel that at times I felt I could not read any more of , but I novel I simply could n't put down . Depressing yes , but utterly gripping . The film . Oh dear . Hollywood took Barker 's truth and reality , and showered a layer of sweet icing sugar over the top of it . A beautiful film , an inspiring soundtrack , excellent performances , a tale of hope and romance ... yes . An adaptation of ' Union Street' ... no . The women of Union Street and their stories are condensed into Fonda 's character , their stories are touched on , but many are discarded . I accept that some of Barker 's tales are sensitive issues and are too horrific for mass viewing , and that a film with around 7 leading protagonists just is n't practical , but the content is not my main issue . The essence and the real gut of the novel is lost - darkness and rain , broken windows covered with cardboard , and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced with sunshine , pretty houses , and a twinkling William 's score . If you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope in the face of ' reality ' , I advise that you hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like ' Schindler 's List' ... but without the happy ending .
pos	I loved this movie . Great storyline and actors and good movie sets . It told the story in a way I can easily understand and pay attention to without falling asleep . I would like to know where I could get the soundtrack . I can not find it anywhere . Please email me if you know where I could get the soundtrack . Other than not being able to find the soundtrack I thought the movie was fascinating . Swayze did a great job . I think this is some of his best work . His past movies were OK , but this one really told a story for a change . This will go down in history as being one of the best TV films ever aired . Congrats to the producers and writers of such a great piece of work .
neg	Unless you are mentally ill or the most die hard segal fan you will tire of this horrendous excuse for a film in under 5 minutes . The Plot - Even for a Seagal film , the plot is just stupid . I mean its not just bad , its barely coherent . The Acting - Unbelievably wooden . Literally seen better acting in porno 's . Ironically this film tries to cash in on this audience which a ' lesbian love scene ' which is utterly cringe - worthy . Special Effects - would n't look out of place in a 60 's sword and sorcery flick . Unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other cures , do n't make the same mistake as i did and buy this DVD , as you will be asking for that hour and a half of your life back .
pos	I was brought up on Doc Savage , and was petrified by the green death as a child but even then as now , I found it thoroughly entertaining . I have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactions , granted they mostly think I 'm odd but there you are . " I do n't know what it is about the Doc , but he always gets the girls " has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men . This film is a classic spoof on all the super hero genre , and was way before it 's time , it is not to be taken seriously , move over Austin Powers . Ron Ely is a God . It is unfortunate that this film has n't been released on DVD in the UK . I do n't think it should be remade and bastardised , like I said it 's a classic , it can not be done without Ron.(like the Italian job without Mini 's and Michael Caine ) . I give it 10/10 .
neg	" Absolute Beginners " was a film for the younger generation , a multi - time film that discussed the issues that teens were facing in Britain and how these troubled , constantly hitting each note , teen 's problems can relate to the youth of tomorrow . It could have been dubbed the " Moulin Rouge " of the 80s , but it disappeared . It made its very shallow mark on the world , snuck under the radar , and can now be found collecting dust at either the musical section , the comedy section , or the politically obscure section of that seedy video store that does n't need chain money to survive . Alas , that was n't where I found it  but I found it , watched it , tried my hardest to sing along with it , stared into Bowie 's eyes , but found myself faded by the end . Did it not survive the test of time ? Is 1950s London too far removed from our current society ? Is Bowie too creepy ? I think " Absolute Beginners " falls somewhere into each of these questions as the perfect example of cinema that starts out with a bang , but withers to a mere sparkle by the end . " Absolute Beginners " opens with a huge number that takes us through the non - gritty streets of London which involve theft nightly , prostitutes on every corner , dance throughout , booze like rivers , and the swankiest ties on nearly every individual . Sounds like a place we would all hate to be   right ? Director Julien Temple keeps the mood light and flashy throughout most of the songs as we attempt to learn something about a plethora of our main characters . The one we follow most is Colin played by Eddie O'Connell who follows his dreams of being a photographer while shooting his favorite girl , Suzette ( played by Patsy Kensit ) . These two have chemistry , and while Suzette looks like a pre - rehab Lohan , to me they worked . There was a huge spark between them , the chemistry was like lava , and I believed that these two could take me down a road I had never traveled . I was ready  but then , something happened . Temple takes us out of the nightlife , takes us out of the city we grew up with at the beginning , and completely reverses the roles without any dedication to the first . Suzette runs away , Colin becomes a pervert , and Bowie   well   I am not quite sure what his role is but he sings amazingly well while climbing a mountain  I can tell you that much . Temple gives us this flashy city , this opportunity to see those that inhabit it , but leaves us hanging high and dry when it is time to pull the trigger . We learn about Colin , mainly , but nobody else . I could probably watch this film again and still be equally confused as to whom is angry at whom , and what importance fashion had to that era . Also , were they teens really  they all seemed like they were pushing their late 20s , but maybe it was my TV . Character development thrown right out the door , Temple tries to overcompensate by giving us bigger , more lavish songs using even more characters that we know nothing about . One of my favorite songs in the film uses this thought as a prime example . Temple uses a split house to show us the lives of Colin 's parents ( of which I did n't know it was them until after the film ) and a song which screams apathy . Great song , too many characters , not enough time , suddenly dragged into another scene of missing coherency , and it just falls apart in your hands . Then , if that was n't enough , we are rocking our heads to the beat of some great songs , rubbing our noggin ' trying to understand where our characters are or are going , and Temple throws in hatred , anger , and politics into the final act . While I was hoping that this film would have a dedicated theme , I did n't think racism would be on the top of the bill . Suddenly , friends are missing , people are angry , and there is some random guy running around fighting Colin because he lives in poverty and has a friend of a different race ? Somebody help me out here . It seemed completely rushed and overwhelming  nearly to the point of wanting to turn the film off . To me , the ending of " Absolute Beginners " was nowhere near the excitement from the opening number . That first part set the pace , and Temple could not keep up . Overall , I must say that Temple can direct a music video , but I do n't think he was quite prepared for the feature film . I do n't think this film will ever make it into full " cult " status , and will probably remain unremembered or in the dollar bin for years to come . It is a fun film to watch initially , but when we get to that final part , it just explodes from the inside . I wanted some cutting edge work , but instead what I found was a freaky Bowie coupled with characters I cared nothing for . I could see how this film could relate to the youth of the 80s , but by the end it just felt forced . I think everyone in this production should have taken a moment and listened to " Motivation " by the ever - freaky Bowie in this film , it may have helped solidify this feature into better cult status . I am glad that I watched this film once , but that is all that my small brain can take . I loved the way that Temple caught me from the beginning , but he could n't control his characters ( way too many ) , and the songs did n't seem to match the final moments of the film . It came out of nowhere , and it was unwelcomed . If this was a film about racism , it needed to be from the beginning . " Absolute Beginners " was a welcomed adventure , but I do n't think I will be dusting this film off in the future . Grade : * * out of * * * * *
pos	Everyone should totally see this movie ! It 's freaking scary , but does n't resort to lame " jump - out - at - you - just - to - surprise - you - and - pass - it - off - as - scary " things . It really is great . See this freaking awesome movie ! ! ! The director is Stanley Kubrick , easily the greatest director who ever lived . Every single one of his movies are masterpieces , including this one . The Shining is about this family that goes to a hotel in the Colorado Rockies as caretakers for the winters , and get snowed in . Well , the house is haunted . The kid is psychic . The husband is easily impacted by evil haunted hotels , and ... well ... HILARITY ENSUES ! ! ! ! Not really . It becomes this gripping thriller where stuff gets thrown at the viewer from all different directions , and it gets scary . Not just the classic , " Here 's Johnny " scene . It 's memorable , but ca n't speak for the whole movies . It 's one of those things where words do n't explain it adequately , and you just got ta see it . So go on Netflix , and get it ! GEEEEEETTTTTTTT ITTTTTTTT ! ! ! ! ! ! !
neg	* * * SPOILERS * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * Continued ... From here on in the whole movie collapses in on itself . First we meet a rogue program with the indication we 're gon na get ghosts and vampires and werewolves and the like . We get a guy with a retarded accent talking endless garbage , two ' ghosts ' that serve no real purpose and have no character what - so - ever and a bunch of henchmen . Someone 's told me they 're vampires ( straight out of Blade 2 ) , but they 're so undefined I did n't realise . The funny accented guy with a ridiculous name suffers the same problem as the Oracle , only for far longer and far far worse . He has a simple point about cause and effect , makes it , then continues to make it and make it until it becomes convoluted and stupid . His final line before walking off is comparable to Storm 's " do you know what happens to a toad ... " line in X - men in levels of utter bland baddness . The chocolate cake is such a lazy , pathetic cliche and Monica Bellucci as the wife does nothing other than exactly what we expect the moment we see her . And then we get another kung fu fight ! ! ! WHY ? Neo is , allegedly , The One . He can do anything . He has the ultimate power and what does he use it for . Kung bloody fu all the time . And while he can stop 1000 bullets , he still gets cut by a sword and still makes a meal of 5 undecipherable henchmen ( vampires ? ) . I wanted to see mind blowing powers . I wanted to see him do the wildest , craziest most insane s * * * to people because he can do anything . I got the same as before without the ' wow ' . The fabled car chase . That ca n't be bad . Well ... no , it 's not . It 's just not what we 've been tyold it was going to be . ALL the cool shots from this scene are in the trailer . Every one . So all possibly Wow has been taken from us so all we now get is a good chase sequence with , guess what , a kung fu fight ! ! ! OK , it 's not Neo , but you 'd have thought he 'd have explained to his closest friends about the reality of the Matrix . At least taught them something . It 's not hard . " Hey , Morpheus , do n't worry about what happens to you in the matrix . It 's not real . As long as you understand that nothing 's real then nothing can really harm you . " There you go . Simple . OK , so the chase is not bad . It 's never boring and it does n't seem like 16 minutes . It 's just so underwhelming . And still , it gets worse . The final climax to the movie is quite probably the worst imaginable . They have this whole elaborate plan that involves three crews . They then only show it sporadically between Morpheus 's over long , super preachy , monologue . To make it worse , they never clearly define what this plan that needs 3 teams is . You know basically , but you do n't know who 's doing what , when , so when one crew goes down you just do n't care and you do n't know how this is going to affect what goes on . I 'll sum it up though , it happens so Trinity can get back into the Matrix to setup the end . That 's the only reason it happens . Which raises the question , why did they need to send 6 people originally ? Trinity gets in in five minutes by herself ! Neo 's journey to the centre of the Matrix ( so to speak ) is handled equally lazily . Ooohhh ! ! ! He runs into another 100 Agent Smiths ! ! ! Woooooo ! ! ! That must 've taken a lot of thought . Only now they 're in a corridor so the fight has no scale and is over in a moment . Man , what a grand finale ! ! ! And then the Architect ! ! ! Remember everything I said was bad about the Oracle and the foreign guy ? Add them together and double it , that 's how truly appalling the Architect is . The only reasonable potential of him is he 's about to set up the cliffhanging climax . And then he blows it ! Let 's look at the options he gives Neo . Choose one door and all humanity dies ( except 27 ! ! ! ) . Choose the other and all humanity dies ! ! ! Considering choice is something this film tries to explore it does n't really give it 's hero one . If he had a choice of Save humanity and the missus dies or Save the missus and kill humanity there 's the potnetial for inner torment and tension . Also , with Trinity being mid fall , the potential of a real cliffhanger that would 've made seeing the third more essential . But no . He has save no - one or save the missus . Now , the very worst thing about the original Matrix was Neo dying and then coming back to life right at the end . The year it came out everyone was so annoyed by how stupid Jar Jar was they did n't notice that the very end of The Matrix made him look him Steven Hawking . " The Oracle told me I 'd fall in love with the One , and I love you " .... Come On ! ! ! ! How can the whole world have missed how utterly terrible that was ? So , what do the Wachowski 's do in the sequel ? Well , they make the ending of the original look better . How ? Well , by doing almost exactly the same thing again ( only swapping characters ) only so much worse I think my f a and r keys would be worn out if I kept writing far before I got to worse . And the cliffhanger is just not really a cliffhanger . It 's a reminder . Basically , this film is just bad . I really did n't want it to be bad , but it is . Bad in just so many ways . And to make matters worse , this is n't a film with not enough budget . It 's not a film with too short a schedule . It 's not a film that 's been rushed out . It 's not a film where too much influence has come from the outside . This is exactly the film the Wachowski 's set out to make with Warner 's fortune fully behind them . And that 's what makes this so awful . At least Rancid Aluminium can say that it did n't haev enough time or money . Matrix Reloaded . The worst film ever made ? Maybe not quite . The most disappointing and defalting film ever made . Undeniably .
pos	Maybe I 'm being too generous with the rating ... but I just love this movie ! I 've seen it so many times , but every time I see it I fall in love with it all over again . It 's just a simple romantic comedy , with nothing huge or monumentous that happens . But I 'm a big romantic and this movie * is * romantic . I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins , and Walter Mathau is so funny . The scientists make me laugh so much ... I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has n't seen it . It 's such a clean , good movie - and those are so rare now ! My 20-year - old brother likes this movie , too , so it 's not just a chick - flick . ;-) I recommend it if you need to laugh , or if you 're just lonely and need to * watch * a romance , if you yourself ca n't participate in one . It 's a good ' un !
neg	Whoo - boy , that was definitely one of the worst flicks I 've seen all summer . Granted , it was on Sci Fi , and I do n't watch much Sci Fi , but man , talk about a razor thin plot and two dimensional characters to the max . The characters were stereotypical and overdone , the plot and setting were unbelievable , the vampires were less intimidating , more funny - looking , the gore was unnecessary , the special effects were down - right horrible , and the ending ? Well , the only thing unpredictable about the ending was when suddenly the tomboy becomes a lesbian and starts to do it with the female vampire , which , by the way , is n't really all that hot considering it occurs for about three seconds , in which you 're closer to " What the hell ? " then " Man , that 's hot . " If this ever appears in reruns , God forbid , DON'T WATCH IT .
pos	For some reason , this film has never turned up in its original language in my neck of the woods ( despite owning the TCM UK Cable channel , which broadcasts scores of MGM titles week in week out ) . More disappointingly , it 's still M.I.A. on DVD  even from Warners ' recently - announced " Western Classics Collection " Box Set ( which does include 3 other Robert Taylor genre efforts ) ; maybe , they 're saving it for an eventual " Signature Collection " devoted to this stalwart of MGM , which may be coming next year in time for the 40th anniversary of his passing    I say this because the film allows him a rare villainous role as a selfish Westerner with a fanatical hatred of Indians and who opts to exploit his expert marksmanship by making some easy money hunting buffaloes ; an opening statement offers the alarming statistic that the population of this species was reduced from 60,000,000 to 3,000 in the space of just 30 years ! As an associate , Taylor picks on former professional of the trade Stewart Granger  who rallies alcoholic , peg - legged Lloyd Nolan ( who continually taunts the irascible and vindictive Taylor ) and teenage half - breed Russ Tamblyn to this end . As expected , the company 's relationship is a shaky one  reminiscent of that at the centre of Anthony Mann 's THE NAKED SPUR ( 1953 ) , another bleak open - air MGM Western . The film , in fact , ably approximates the flavor and toughness of Mann 's work in this field ( despite being writer / director Brooks ' first of just a handful of such outings but which , cumulatively , exhibited a remarkable diversity ) ; here , too , the narrative throws in a female presence ( Debra Paget , also a half - breed ) to be contended between the two rugged leads  and Granger , like the James Stewart of THE NAKED SPUR , returns to his job only grudgingly ( his remorse at having to kill buffaloes for mere sport and profit is effectively realized ) . The latter also suffers in seeing Taylor take Paget for himself  she bravely but coldly endures his approaches , while secretly craving for Granger  and lets out his frustration on the locals at a bar while drunk ! Taylor , himself , does n't come out unscathed from the deal : like the protagonist of THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE ( 1948 ) , he becomes diffident and jealous of his associates , especially with respect to a rare  and , therefore , precious  hide of a white buffalo they 've caught ; he even goes buffalo - crazy at one point ( as Nolan had predicted ) , becoming deluded into taking the rumble of thunder for the hooves of an approaching mass of the species ! The hunting scenes themselves are impressive  buffaloes stampeding , tumbling to the ground when hit , the endless line - up of the day 's catch , and the carcasses which subsequently infest the meadows . The film 's atypical but memorable denouement , then , is justly famous : with Winter in full swing , a now - paranoid Taylor out for Granger 's blood lies in wait outside a cave ( in which the latter and Paget have taken refuge ) to shoot him ; when Granger emerges the next morning , he discovers Taylor in a hunched position  frozen to death !   Incidentally , my father owns a copy of the hefty source novel of this ( by Milton Lott ) from the time of the film 's original release : actually , he has collected a vast number of such editions  it is , after all , a practice still in vogue  where a book is re - issued to promote its cinematic adaptation . Likewise for the record , Taylor and Granger  who work very well off each other here  had already been teamed ( as sibling whale hunters ! ) in the seafaring adventure ALL THE BROTHERS WERE VALIANT ( 1953 )  which , curiously enough , is just as difficult to see ( in fact , even more so , considering that it 's not even been shown on Italian TV for what seems like ages ) ! !
neg	A far as B - movies go , SCARECROW is one of those that are so bad , that it becomes incredibly annoying to sit through . A lonely loser high school student who is constantly picked on by classmates and rejected by girls , ends up walking in on his trailer trash mother having sex with a drunk redneck . He then chases the kid out into a nearby cornfield and kills him . Apparently , the kids soul was transfered into a scarecrow which then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him as well as teachers . This scarecrow , aside from having a snappy one - liner for each of his victims , can also do Matrix - like flips through the air and kill people on sidewalks in broad daylight . Also , why did he always look like a rotted corpse ? Just like the two needless sequels that followed this , this is n't even worth a laugh .
pos	When I first read Armistead Maupins story I was taken in by the human drama displayed by Gabriel No one and those he cares about and loves . That being said , we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of Hollywood ... Writer Armistead Maupin and director Patrick Stettner have truly succeeded !   With just the right amount of restraint Robin Williams captures the fragile essence of Gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel life(Jess ) and the world around him(Donna ) . As we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably . The request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps Gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward . It 's to bad that most people will avoid this film . I only say that because the average American will probably think " Robin Williams in a serious role ? That did n't work before ! " PLEASE GIVE THIS MOVIE A CHANCE ! Robin Williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people . Like his movie One Hour Photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of art . Oh and before I forget , I believe Bobby Cannavale as Jess steals every scene he is in . He has the 1940 's leading man looks and screen presence . It 's this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right now ! ! S~
neg	for all the subtle charms this student film may contain , was anyone else bored to death waiting WENDINGO to show his paper macho face ? ? the anti - climax pretty much ruined any sort of momentum we had speed actioned to develop . do n't get me wrong , i 'm all into exploring America 's dark underbelly , but this is a turd - a - flambé that gets a nod to watchable only for the fact that p.clarkson looks hot taking it . sadly , from a guy from wings . the best 2 minutes the film has to offer . if you felt like ripping off DELIVERANCE , you could do better .
pos	I must admit that at the beginning , I was sort of reticent about watching this movie . I thought it was this stupid , little , romantic film about a French woman who meets in the train an American and decides to visit Vienna with him . I was not actually enchanted about this kind of script , since it continued to make me believe that it is just a movie . Still , I watched it ! And I was amazed ... "Before Sunrise " is one of the few films who dare to talk in a rather philosophical way , wondering about the fact that in the moment of our birth , we are sentenced to death , or that it is a middling idea that fact that a couple should rest together for eternity , or that , we , humans , can afford sometimes to live in fairy - tales .   The ending was wonderfully chosen ( we do not know if they will meet again in six months , at six o'clock , in Vienna 's station ) -in our optimism , we sincerely hope so . The actors acted in a very good manner , so , that , I began to believe that I , myself could live a love - story just like this .
neg	Interesting idea and storyline which did n't quite work . When you see the film , maybe you will feel as dissatisfied with the ending as I did . I did n't really know who to root for in the movie , Taye Diggs looked bored as the detective , the rest of the characters seem so one - dimensional and unpleasant . If the victim Alicia(Mia Kirschner ) had been more of a nice girl , we might actually have enjoyed seeing the plot unfold and the perpetrator brought to justice . The problem was that she was as bitchy as the other girls , turning from sweet girl to conniving opportunistic cokehead . I ca n't understand the moral message of this film , and as a detective story and thriller it does n't work .
pos	After a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted , urban , turn of the century Australian street , we meet Julie ( Rebecca Gibney ) and Peter ( John Adam ) as they go out house hunting . They manage to get a loan for a fixer - upper on a posh Sydney street , but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home . It just may be haunted . 13 Gantry Row combines a memorable if somewhat clichéd story with good to average direction by Catherine Millar into a slightly above average shocker . The biggest flaws seem partially due to budget , but not wholly excusable to that hurdle . A crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film . The opening " thriller scene " features some wonky editing . Freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there 's not much action . Suspense should be created from staging , not fancy " fix it in the mix " techniques . There is great atmosphere in the scene from the location , the lighting , the fog and such , but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim , cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street , showing their increasing proximity . The tracking and the cuts need to be slow . The attack needed to be longer , clearer and better blocked . As it stands , the scene has a strong " made for television " feel , and a low budget one at that . After this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves . The story has a lot of similarities to The Amityville Horror ( 1979 ) , though the budget forces a much subtler approach . Millar and scriptwriter Tony Morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios , often dramatic in nature instead of special effects - oriented , such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron , which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall . For some horror fans , the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama . At least the first half hour of the film is primarily about Julie and Peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in . But Morphett writes fine , intelligent dialogue . The material is done well enough that it 's often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise later -- especially if you 've gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house . Once they get settled and things begin to get weirder , even though the special effects often leave much to be desired , the ideas are good . The performances help create tension . There is n't an abundance of death and destruction in the film -- there 's more of an abundance of home repair nightmares . But neither menace is really the point . The point is human relationships . There are a number of character arcs that are very interesting . The house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it . That it 's in a posh neighborhood , and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies , shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe , such as money or health problems . Peter 's character evolves from a striving corporate employee with " normal " work - based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive , scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful . At the same time , we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be . Julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown , but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship . Although 13 Gantry Row never quite transcends its made - for - television clunkiness , as a TV movie , this is a pretty good one , with admirable ambitions . Anyone fond of haunted house films , psycho films or horror / thrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy . It certainly is n't worth spending $ 30 for a DVD ( that was the price my local PBS station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it ( factoring in shipping and handling ) ) , but it 's worth a rental , and it 's definitely worth watching for free .
neg	I can clearly see now why Robin Hood flopped quickly . The first episode of it is probably the worst ever thing BBC has aired . The opening scenes were about as intense , meaningful and intelligent as two monkeys fighting , Robin Hood had no character , and the sword fight was just laughable . The worst part of the episode was Robin Hood snogging some cow clad in make - up at the beginning of the episode - how many people wore eyeliner in the 12th century ? Nobody . The series may have improved drastically since then , but this first episode quickly put people 's hopes down , and is essentially a pile of cr*p . A great hero of England has been disgraced . " Will You Tolerate This ? " I wo n't , that 's for sure , unless the BBC start to understand what is a wise investment . 3/10
pos	people claim its edited funny but they had to cut it down substantially in post production . i have harry as a professor right now at ucsd , and honestly its one of the best classes I 've had , its rather funny to here about what happened in making the film cause harry is so animated . i originally watched " joy of life " for another class where harry did a voice over in the film , and started watching this film after i started the class . Harry originally did some performance work , and is really genuine about creating moments that move you , especially when you have to re edit things until you hit on that moment , but its something you see in this film .
neg	We went into this movie because my husband had enjoyed the original version of ` My favourite Martian ' . We had our 6 year old daughter with us . She wanted to leave halfway through the movie which was fine with both her parents ! The parts we did see were only occasionally humorous , mostly either too silly or gross . I would expect that this movie might appeal to kids between 9 - 12 , if that . It 's definitely not suited for younger children . From what I 've heard the original series was by far superior and if you are going to " relive the past " you 'll probably be disappointed .
pos	This is a great " small " film . I say " small " because it does n't have a hundred guns firing or a dozen explosions , as in a John Woo film . Great performances by Roy Scheider and the three " bad guys " . John Frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days . The film is very easy to watch , the story is more of a yarn than a washing machine -- instead of everything going around and around , it seems as though things just get worse as the plot thickens . Wonderful ending , very positive . I never read the Elmore Leonard book , but it ca n't be much different from the film because it FEELS like I 'm watching an Elmore Leonard movie .
neg	How Rick Sloane was allowed to make five movies is harder to believe than cold fusion . This film is absolutely criminal . Before watching this movie I thought Manos : Hands of Fate was the worse piece of crap I ever saw , but at least Manos moves so slowly you might fall asleep , thereby rescuing your eyes from the pain it will suffer . The greatest tragedy of this movie is that the old man that keeps the Hobgoblins " locked " up makes it to the final scene . The time I spent watching this movie was an absolute waste of my life .
pos	Camp with a capital C. Think of Mask and the Ace Ventura movies -- then multiply by 100 . This laugh - a - minute entertainer takes schlock to the level of high art . David Dhawan is a genius and Govinda is beyond description . See it over and over again . I insist .
neg	One of the most popular rentals at my local video store is not Borat or The Departed but a 2005 documentary about Jesus Christ called The God Who Was n't There by director Brian Flemming , an ex - Christian Fundamentalist . Flemming , in his 62-minute documentary , asserts that Jesus was not a historical figure but a legend based solely on Pagan traditions . Using interviews with authors , philosophers , and historians to debunk the long - held Christian belief that Jesus , the son of God , lived among men , was crucified , and was resurrected , Flemming compares the Christ story with those of cult figures Isis and Osiris in Egypt , Dionysus and Adonis in Greek mythology , and Roman mystery cults such as Mithraism and finds many surprising similarities . In addition to his evidence about Pagan cults , he also states that the earliest sources for the Christ story , the four gospels , were written forty or fifty years after the date given for Jesus ' crucifixion and that the letters of St. Paul show little evidence of Jesus being a flesh and blood figure . Flemming , unfortunately however , is not out to conduct a solid investigation of the truth about Jesus ' life but to use the subject only as a point of departure for a full throttle attack on Christianity and all religion . Most of the interviews are with those philosophically aligned with the director including avowed atheists such as Biologist Richard Dawkins and author Sam Price . The only Christians interviewed are those on the fringe such as Scott Butcher , the creator of the website Rapture Letters.com , and Ronald Sipus , principal of the fundamentalist Village Christian School , which Flemming attended as a boy . Like Michael Moore 's interview of Charlton Heston in Bowling for Columbine , his interview with Sipus is so contentious that Sipus walks out in the middle . In a sarcastic tone , Flemming tells us how wrong Christianity was wrong about the sun revolving around the earth , then points to atrocities committed in the name of Christianity such as those by cult leader Charles Manson who killed 11 people and Dena Schlosser , who cut her baby 's arm off for God . He also lifts a statement from a book by LaHaye and Jenkins that says that Christians " look forward to the day when all non - Christians are thrown into a lake of fire , howling and screeching . " To further turn us against Christianity , Flemming shows us extended clips from Mel Gibson 's The Passion of the Christ , detailing in minute detail each scene of violence and torture . What could have been a serious discussion on a very interesting subject eventually becomes a childish rant and a polemic against all religion . In the process of condemning those who used Christianity to commit unspeakable acts , he ignores such people as socialist Muriel Lester , a famous Christian pacifist , Rigoberta Menchú Tum , a Mayan Indian of Guatemala who helped found the Revolutionary Christians and received the Nobel peace prize in recognition of her work for social justice , and Mother Teresa , whose work was about respect for each individual 's worth and dignity . His most telling argument is his comparison of Christian doctrine with the Pagan cults and he makes some good points , yet Flemming does not tell us that while some aspects of these cults may resemble Christian doctrines , there are no texts or source materials for these cults before 300AD , long after the New Testament . Also it is important to note one major difference . The immediate goal of the initiates was a mystical experience that led them to feel they had achieved union with their god . This is anathema to Christianity which believes that a Church hierarchy including priests and bishops all the way up to the Pope are required to interpret God 's will to mankind . Although I am not a Christian and have some doubts about whether or not Jesus Christ was in fact a historical figure , the truth is that , in the long scheme of things , it may not matter . What matters is that a message was introduced to mankind and spread around the world that contributed to mankind 's spiritual evolution . Regardless of the distortions and crimes later committed in its name and there were many , Christianity as conceived was a doctrine of compassion and love , and a moral and ethical code that furthered respect for our fellow man . While I applaud the fact that the film was made and that a taboo topic was discussed , what is sorely needed is not another divisive attempt to use religion as a field of combat but to see it as a common thread that can bring the world 's people together . While there is room for debate and discussion on religious subjects , in the words of Annie Besant , " spiritual truths are best seen in the clear air of brotherhood and mutual respect . The God Who Was n't There is recommended only for those whose idea of a good time is to trash the religion of others .
pos	" Deliverance " is one of the best exploitation films to come out of that wonderful 1970 's decade from whence so many other exploitation films came . A group of friends sets out on a canoe trip down a river in the south and they become victimized by a bunch of toothless hillbillies who pretty much try to ruin their lives . It 's awesome . We are treated to anal rape , vicious beatings , bow and arrow killings , shootings , broken bones , etc ... A lot like 1974 's " Texas Chainsaw Massacre , " to say that " Deliverance " is believable would be immature . This would never and could never happen , even in the dark ages of 1972 . " Deliverance " is a very entertaining ride and packed full of action . It is one in a huge pile of exploitation films to come from the early 70 's and it ( arguably ) sits on top of that pile with it 's great acting , superb cinematography and excellent writing . 8 out of 10 , kids .
neg	In the days before gore and sex took over , real horror films were made . Castle of Blood is , in my estimation , one of the finest , although other reviewers have given it mixed ratings . In an odd sort of way it reminds of the more recent The Others , which was in the theaters a couple of years ago . Director Antonio Margheriti remade his own picture in 1970 titling it this time Web of the Spider ( AKA Nella Stretta Morsa del Ragno ) . Why he did this I do not understand , although the remake starred Anthony Franciosa and Klaus Kinski and was very good in its own right . Perhaps he saw a good story and wished to tailor it more to American audiences . I do not really know . It is interesting that he did the original in black and white and the remake in color . Castle of Blood is excellent Italian Gothic . La Danza Macabra is said to be an unpublished work of Edgar Allen Poe , who " appears " in this film . Poe and Lord Blackwood , owner of a haunted castle , bet American writer Alan Foster ( George Riviere ) that he can not spend All Souls Night in said castle and survive . Foster eagerly accepts the bet but soon regrets it , for he is witness to a series of murders committed by ghosts . It seems that the ghosts come back to life once every few years but are doomed to re - enact the crimes they committed in life . Lord Blackwood conveniently forgot to tell Foster that his blood is needed for them to resurrect themselves on the next All Souls Night !   It does not take Foster and the beautiful Elisabeth Blackwood ( portrayed by the incomparable Barbara Steele ) long to fall in love , even though their romance is doomed , because Elisabeth is one of the ghosts . I will not give the ending away , but will just say that Castle of Blood is every bit a romantic tragedy as it is a horror story .   Comments . This film is greatly atmospheric , even by the excellent standards of the Italians . My personal opinion is they do true horror better than anybody , and the somewhat dim black and white filming only enhances this . In fairness , Web of the Spider was fine in its own right , even with color and greater brightness . I loved the lingering shots , something most modern day directors do not have the patience for . Indeed , when Alan first enters the doomed castle , we are treated to several minutes of him doing nothing but roaming around from room to room , the dread ands unease building in his face and mannerisms . By the time the first ghost appears , the audience is thoroughly primed and ready . There is wonderful dialogue between Alan and the ghosts , something else not often done in standard ghost stories . There are also memorable scenes , very visual for this type of film . Elisabeth 's " murder " and the dance scene ( reminds somewhat of the similar dance of the ghouls in 1962 's Carnival of Souls ) were particularly good . Sadly , few general interest viewers will ever hear of , much less see , this film . That is a shame , for this one is a cut above the rest . I got my copy from Sinister Cinema and am not certain if it can be purchased anywhere else . For persons interested in this genre , it is a must see .
pos	I 'm not a big fan of most anime , but Gundam Wing is truly something else . Gundam wing lacks all of that stereotypical melodrama that you might think of when you think of anime , since the number of jokes made over the 17 hours would only be in the double digits , Gundam Wing gets right down to business .   Gundam Wing is as much of a political thriller as it is an action series . Large parts focus on the diplomatic dealings of a war , not only the battles . Though battle animation lacks extreme detail in cases where it would just be a pain to animate , individual duels between gundams are almost pieces of art considering the animated use of complex mechanics and rapid movements .   To my knowledge , this 49 episode plus one movie series was picked up by cartoon network in 2000 , and then professionally dubbed by them too . the dubbing is simply flawless . not only does every word said match up , but the voices use truly make the characters much more believable . many believe that it is best to watch anime with subs in English , but i simply do n't have the determination to do that .   Not only are the voices good , but the score used over the series is quite impressive . I 'll just say it left me scouring the net in vain to find a soundtrack .   The plot of this series is what will truly hook viewers , and no , not hook you like some prime time drama like Lost which was only made for the purpose of hooking you . explaining the plot deeply would lead to many spoilers , since many of the characters do not even have names until quite a few episodes into the series . The rough idea of the series is that earth and its now independent space colonies are having difficulty maintaining peace . Thus a war is started , leading to military coups and elaborate diplomatic situations . I feel that any more detail would begin to give away information , which is crucial to the plot .   I 'll end here saying that this series is great for anyone that likes anime , anyone that thinks ALL anime is stupid ( they have good reason to think so ) , and anyone looking to get into anime with a serious tone to it .
neg	This is blatantly a futuristic adaptation of Jules Verne 's " Mysterious Island " . The sound editing is pretty bad . You hear the dialogue on set and you hear the voices being recorded on a recording booth at the same time ! This is an amateur film with actors from Boston and shot around New Hampshire . For those living in New Engalnd and who is reading this comment will be wowed with a capital W. This film is full of flaws . You get to hear the director 's voice giving directions and giving out directions to the actress . " OK now stand up . " As for the other characters . There is this guy who talks with his mind instead of his voice and this blue alien . The alien guy talks with a deep voice . When he is yawning or grunting when he is fighting you hear the actor 's voice . As for the special effects , man ! This was Brett Piper 's early work for crying out loud ! The creatures are good but the animation is jerky . Really jerky . Sort of like Karl Zeman animation in JOURNEY TO BEGINNING OF TIME ( 1955 ) . The special effects are imaginative . Thge music is good . Bottom line , this film makes EQUINOX or PLANET OF THE DINOSAURS look like a Ray Harryhausen epic . Did you know MYSTERIOUS PLANET was a home movie and was on a shoes string budget ? A must watch for aspiring film makers .
pos	For those who think it is strictly potty humor and immaturity , you are in fact the mindless one . While the show does contain its share of potty jokes it also contains a lot of satirical material and pokes fun at social problems , racial barriers , cliché's , stereotypes etc . You just need to read into some of her material a bit more to get it . What I also love is that not everything is a punchline . For those expecting a formulated joke like Friends ( I LOVE friends fyi ) , you wo n't find it here . Instead Sarah uses situations and other ways to achieve her humour which is more realistic . We do n't walk around in this world and have witty punchlines for everything said , which is in most comedies . Instead the Sarah Silverman Program makes it more realistic in this sense .   So do n't take it as mindless humor because it is so much more than that .
neg	The Order starts in Rome where the head of a special order of priests who deal in ghosts & demons named Brother Dominic ( Francesco Carnelutti ) is found dead , cut to New York City where one of his order Alex Bernier ( Heath Ledger ) is contacted by top - brass Cardinal Driscoll ( Peter Weller ) who ask 's him to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding Dominic 's death . Along with his girlfriend Mara Willims ( Shannyn Sossamon ) & fellow priest Thomas Garrett ( Mark Addy ) Alex travels to Italy to delve into his mentor 's death , as the truth begins to emerge it appears that Dominic was a ' Sin Eater ' someone who absorbed other 's sins & lived with the burden of them so they could die peacefully & that the Church was n't happy about his activities . Alex must do what 's right even if it goes against what he believes ... Also know under the title The Sin Eater this American German co - production was written , produced & directed by Bian Helgeland & did n't really do that much for me if I 'm honest & I usually am , honest that is . Anyway lets start with the mess of a script that has some OK ideas but it 's throughly predictable , excruciatingly dull & boring , really silly at times & it takes itself far too seriously . The whole concept is daft & while it thinks it 's clever with it 's oh so neat twist ending that ties everything up & brings the story full circle I thought it was the most obvious & lazy way to end things . There 's the usual religious themes here , morality , sin , forgiveness , faith , belief , prophecy 's , blah , blah , blah you know the sort of thing . Then there 's the twists which are n't hard to see coming , there 's the abuse of power by high ranking clergymen , corruption , greed , evil , etc . you know the sort of clichéd Hollywood ideals & themes that get reused every time it deals with the Church . The Order has nothing new to say & as a serious piece of film - making it sucks , a lot . I 'm not too sure who The Order is meant to appeal to , as a die - hard horror fan I did n't see much horror in this at all , as a thriller it 's less than thrilling , as a mystery it 's too predictable & there 's nothing here to really grip or maintain ones interest & for some reason I can not figure out the IMDb also lists The Order as an action film which is absurd as it 's as exciting & action - packed as the average episode of Sesame Street ( 1969 - present ) , harsh maybe but it 's what I think ... Director Helgeland does an OK job , the film seems to have a very soft lighting scheme & it all looks a bit drab , grayish & dull . For a supposed horror film The Order is very light on scares or horror elements , in fact there are n't any of either apart from two evil kids who can turn into a flock of birds for no apparent reason , do n't ask . Forget about any gore or violence as there is n't any which is fine but it would have helped at least make The Order somewhat watchable . According the IMDb 's ' Trivia ' section the release date of The Order was put back so some of the special effects could be improved because they looked unintentionally funny , all I can say is judging by the finished film the effects must have been really bad to start with because they are n't exactly brilliant as it stands now . I was amazed to see The Order had a budget of about $ 28,000,000 which is a hell of a lot of money & I just ca n't see where it all went apart from the sets & production design which are good . The whole film looks & feels very average & utterly forgettable . The acting is OK although the annoying fat guy who seems to be some sort of foul - mouthed comic relief irritates , a good actor such as Peter Weller deserves better than this . The Order , I prefer the title The Sin Eater actually not that it matters too much , misses all of it 's intended targets by the proverbial mile as far as I 'm concerned & is a pretty dull way to waste 100 odd minutes of your life so do n't do it ! Not recommended .
pos	A featherweight plot and dubious characterizations do n't make any difference when a movie is as fun to watch as this one is . Lively action and spectacular stunts - for their day - give this movie some real zip . And there 's some actual comedy from the ripping chemistry between the two leads . Quinn makes a good villain also , although his role is completely overshadowed . But do n't be fooled by Maureen O'Hara 's tough broad role , this is as sexist as any Hollywood movie of this era . You might be able to forgive that because of the time in which it was made , but it 's still hard to get past . For all the heroism and gruesomely adult off - screen situations , this is still little more than an adolescent good time .
neg	I have loved this book since my 5th grade teacher read it to our class many years ago . And I have read it to every one of my 3rd and 5th grade classes over my past 18 years of teaching . Supposedly a movie had been made in the past , but I 'd never been able to locate it . Well , my students and I were all so excited when we heard that Disney had brought Madeline L'Engle 's excellent book to the screen .   As I watched the movie , I had the highest of hopes . As the film went on , I became more and more despondent . They had botched it badly ! Never had I been so let down by a favorite book - to - film adaption . I understand that films ca n't stick strictly to a book , but they do n't need to change things for the sake of it ! Most , if not all , of departures from the book were totally unnecessary !   I kept my opinion to myself at first and just listened to my students discuss the movie . Well , it was n't just me . Nearly every single one felt the same way -- cheated out of the great story that Madeline L'Engle had so skillfully created !   Why , they wondered , did Aunt Beast look like Chewbacca from the star wars movie ? Why could n't Calvin 's hair have been red ? Why did Mrs. Which not have the proper " witch - like " outfit that was such a clever play on her name ? Basically , we all wondered -- why did nearly every single detail have to be changed ?   I have always dreamed of how wonderful a movie this book would make . I am still waiting for that movie . This one was A Wrinkle in Time in only the broadest of senses . I 'm going to write to Peter Jackson and try to convince him to take on the task !
pos	   What can I say ? This is one of the most perfect films ever made . Its a throwback to the glitxy , sterling romantic comedies of the 1940s .. but with a modern touch . The screenplay bursts with wit , charm , humor and tenderness , the cinematograpy is breathtaking(NYC never looked so beautiful),and of course there is the cast ! Dudley Moore turns in the performance of his career as Loveable , drunken Arthur Bach . He is also wistful and real .. one of the film 's best lines is his poignant " Not Everyone who drinks is a poet ... some of us drink because we 're not poets . " The great Sir John Gielgud won a much deserved Oscar for his splendid performance as Hobson , Arthur 's valet and caretaker . Although He considered it a " take the money and run role",He brings to the character all the talent , experience and bravura of an expert tragidian and a sly comedian . The supporting cast is also out of thisworld , from Geraldine Fitzgerald 's sassy Grandma Bach to Stephen Elliott 's bombastic Mafioso .   The score is also extremely memorable and compliments the film perfectly . The only real problem with the film is the ill fated sequel it spawned .
neg	Oh man , what was Sam Mraovich thinking ? What was anyone who was involved in this " film " thinking ? Mraovich is the head of nearly everything of " Ben and Arthur " : Director , writer , producer ( also EXECUTIVE producer ! ) , caster , lead star- you name it , he did it . And he ( Mraovich ) sucks more than anyone has ever sucked in every department of film making . So what is wrong with this film ? Everything . The film is about two gay lovers , Ben ( Jamie Brett Gabel ) and Arthur ( Mraovich- * groan * ) . Ben and Arthur want to get married in a world where everyone basically hates gay people . To make things worse , Ben 's crazy " ex - wife " ( they do n't exactly divorce ) , Tammy ( Julie Belknap ) is steaming mad that Ben 's left her for another man and demands Ben that they get back together ( saying that she can be gay , too ! ) and Arthur 's Christian devoted , excessively hypocritical , equally batty as Tammy brother , Victor , is hell bent on making Arthur turn straight and then try to kill him after he gets kicked out of his church . The film is absolutely chock a block with so many goofs ( ie . Ben and Arthur fly to Vermont to get married- they go there on Alaska Airlines and Vermont has palm trees ; they fly back on a FedEx cargo plane- hope they were comfy in a wooden crate , plus many , many more ) and plot holes to boot ( Victor calls killing Arthur " The Final Plan " which later changes to " The Final Deed " ; Arthur and the private ( intern ) detective drive the same car , blah , blah , blah ) . The " actors " are all very bad and are way , way over the top ; the script is laughably horrible(one such example is " I do n't make sense ? You do n't make sense ! I make sense , that 's who makes sense ! " ) and there so much more wrong with the " movie " that I ca n't write them all down . However , the most laughable yet unbelievable thing about " Ben and Arthur " is that Sam Mraovich thinks that he has created something that is truly fantastic ( see his fake reviews for " Ben & Arthur " and obvious comments by him on YouTube . ) . Mraovich is narcissistic and his arrogance blinds him from seeing how awful anything with his name on it really is . So , to conclude , forget every bad film that you claim is the worst movie ever- " Ben and Arthur " will knock them right off that title , even Paris Hilton movies look like " The Dark Knight " compared to the monstrosity known as " Ben and Arthur " .
pos	I went to see Ashura as 2005 Fantasia Festival Kickoff . Man , that was one cool kick off . The director was supposed to be in Montreal for the Canadian premiere , but due to health reasons , he 's still in Japan ... oh lord I hope he gets better and makes plenty of other movies . The plot is pretty simple , but somewhat original ... the demons are roaming in Edo in Japan and Swordsmans called " Demon Wardens " are slaying them and fearing the rebirth of Ashura , the demon goddess who 's sleeping and supposedly is very kick - ass . It brings us to Izumo ... some kind of elite swordsman called " Demon Slayer " and his buddy Jaku who 's the typical violent jealous asshole ... Seems boring ? Well now it thickens .... Izumo took his retirement from killing demons since he slayed a young kid on the " impression " that he was the demon , he never knew , but he did killed her . So Izumo went on with his life and recycled himself in Kabuki theater . In a boat joyride on a nice night , Izumo spots a girl hiding on a bridge and it changes his life and restart to slay demons ... for the good cause , the cause of love ... and damn ... the guy knows how to handle a sword and to pull an entertaining massacre . Izumo carries the movie as far as playing goes ... he is the total package ... he knows how to fight(hell yeah he knows ) , he 's witty , he 's intelligent and he has that grit . You never have to yell : " NO IZUMO , IT 'S A TRAP " The guy already knows it he has that common sense . He 's really the perfect hero . As far as cinematography goes , the esthetics are pretty interesting . It 's by far , the movie that looks the most like a manga . It 's creamed full of special effects and nothing , at all cost will prevent this movie to look realistic ... it 's pretty amazing . Lots of colours an " unreal " photography , other than that ... it 's pretty straightforward ... but like I said , the main character is carrying the movie A must see , a tale lead by masterful hands
neg	This was quite possibly the worst film I 've ever seen . The plot did n't make a whole lot of sense and the acting was awful . I 'm a big fan of Amber Benson , I think she 's usually a wonderful actress , I ca n't imagine why she decided to do this film . Her character , Piper , is drunk for almost the whole film , with the exception of the opening scene . On the plus side , there was several points in the film where the acting was so bad , I actually laughed out loud . But despite that , I would not recommend this film to anyone . It 's only 80 minutes long , but that 's 80 minutes of your life that you will have completely wasted .
pos	Besides Planes , Trains and Automobiles and Uncle Buck , this is John Candy 's funniest movie . When he gets hypnotized with the playing card ( similar to the Manchurian Candidate ) and becomes a horny guy who does not know what he is saying , he makes two very memorable quotes ( Both deal with the male anatomy ) . The love scene involving grocery items has to be seen , it can not be described .
neg	I do n't know what else to say about this horrible movie that has n't already been said . Honestly I have only myself to be angry with . I should have know better when I saw the title of this movie that it would be a horrible piece of crap , but I loved War Games so I indulged my whim . I will live to regret that decision the rest of my life . From the very start when the government people explained that their super computer could determine who a terrorist was just by how well they played a video game I knew I was in for a ride though the land - that - good - writing - forgot . The list of very , very , very bad plot lines , dialog , and acting is so long I would crash IMDb if I tried to post it . To those people who said that they have seen worst movies than this one please tell me . I am actually curious to see something that could top this steaming pile of horse dung .
pos	I ran across this several years ago while channel surfing on a Sunday afternoon . Though it was obviously a cheesy TV movie from the 70s , the direction and score were well done enough that it grabbed my attention , and indeed I was hooked and had to watch it through to the end . I recently got the opportunity to buy a foreign DVD of this film ( oops , did n't notice a domestic one had finally come out a couple months prior ) , and was very pleased to be able to watch it again ( and in its entirety ) . I do n't wholly understand the phenomenon , but somehow the 70s seem to have a lock on horror movies that are actually scary . The decades prior to the 70s produced some beautifully shot films and the bulk of our enduring horror icons , but are they actually scary ? No , not very . Likewise in the years since the 70s we 've gotten horror movies that are cooler , more exciting , have much better production values and sophisticated special effects , are more fun , funnier , have effective " jump " moments , and some very creative uses of gore , but again ... they are n't really scary ! There 's just something about the atmosphere of the 70s horror films . The grainy film quality . The spookily dark scenes unilluminated by vast high - tech lighting rigs . The " edge of dreamland " muted quality of the dialogue and the weird and stridently EQ'd scores . The odd sense of unease and ugliness permeating everything . Everything that works to undermine most movies of the 70s , in the case of horror , works in its favor . Specifically , in this film , the quiet , intense shots of the devil dog staring people down is fairly unnerving . So much more effective than if they had gone the more obvious route of having the dog be growling , slavering , and overtly hostile ( " Cujo " ? ) . The filmmakers wisely save that for when the dog appears in its full - on supernatural form . The effects when that occurs , while unsophisticated by today 's standards , literally gave me chills . The bizarre , vaguely - defined , " I 'm not quite sure what I 'm looking at " look intuitively strikes me as more like how a real supernatural vision would be , rather than the hyper - real , crystal clear optical printer / digital compositor confections of latter - day horror films . While the human characters in this film are not as satisfyingly rendered as their nemesis or the world they inhabit , the actors all do a decent job . The pairing of the brother and sister from the " Witch Mountain " movies as , yes , brother and sister , is a rather cheesy bit of stunt casting , but they do fine . Yvette Mimieux always manages to be entertaining if unspectacular . Richard Crenna earns more and more empathy from the audience as the film progresses . His self - doubt as he wonders whether his family 's alienness is truly due to a supernatural plot or whether he 's merely succumbing to paranoid schizophrenia is pretty well handled , though his thought that getting a routine physical may provide an explanation for what he 's been experiencing is absurd in its naïveté . The movie 's The - End - Question - Mark type ending is one of the only ones I 've seen that does n't feel like a cheap gimmick , and actually made me think about the choices these characters would be faced with next and what they 'd be likely to do and how they 'd feel about it . Detractors of this film may say it 's merely a feature - length vehicle for some neato glowing retina shots , but hey , you could say the same thing about " Blade Runner " . :-)
neg	A group of extremely unlikable A - holes are tormented by lame puppets that some elderly douche bag night - watchman has kept locked away in a film vault for twenty years for no reason whatsoever . Many people know this film merely from MST3 K 's spot - on ribbing of the flick . But I 've seen the actual movie and can safely say that yes it 's bad , really , REALLY bad . From the one of the most awful ' fight ' scenes I 've ever witnessed to the stuffed toy ' aliens ' that suffer from a lack of motion ( I had a My Pet Monster that was scarier ) right up to the atrocious acting ( I had a My Pet Monster that was more charismatic ) However , that being said Rick Sloan 's " Vice Academy " films are somehow , and trust me I have no earthly idea how , much worse . That 's not to suggest that this film is anything but crap , because it is n't . Just throwing it out there . Eye Candy : no nudity in the movie proper , but there 's 2 pairs of tits in the DVD Introduction to the film   My Grade : D-   Retromedia DVD Extras : Introduction by Jim Wynorski ; Stills gallery ; and Trailer for this film
pos	Zombie Chronicles is n't something to shout about , it 's obvious not a award winning movie but it is a entertaining B - movie directed by Brad Sykes who directed Camp Blood which was another entertaining low budget flick . The acting is bad like most cheaply made movies but that 's what makes it more entertaining , the zombie make - up is cool and effective especially with the budget , the gore is also great and gross , the film is sort of like a zombie version of Tales from the Crypt since we get two tales about zombie encounters in the woods , the stories are fun and do leave you guessing especially the first tale . Zombie Chronicles is a lot better than some low budget zombie movies out there , if you love low budget B - movies or cheaply made zombie flicks then check out Zombie Chronicles .
neg	This movie was so poorly written and directed I fell asleep 30 minutes through the movie . The jokes in the movie are corny and even though the plot is interesting at some angles , it is too far fetched and at some points- ridiculous . If you are 11 or older you will overlook the writing in the movie and be disappointed , but if you are 10 or younger this is a film that will capture your attention and be amazed with all the stunts ( which I might add are poorly done ) and wish you were some warrior to . The casting in this movie was n't very good , and the music was very disappointing because it was like they were trying to build up the tension but it did n't fit at all . On a scale of 1 - 10 ( 10 being excellent , 1 being horrible ) the acting in this movie is a 4 . Brenda Song is talented in comedy , but with this kind of movie , in some of the more serious scenes , her acting was laughable . When she made some of her " fighting " poses , I started laughing out loud . I think the worst thing about this movie is definitely the directing , for example , the part where her enemy turns out to be the person the evil villain is possesing , how her voice turns dark and evil , I think that was incredibly stupid , and how Wendy 's ( Brenda Song)teachers were all her teachers at school being possessed by monks , that was pretty ridiculous to . So to sumamrize it all , a disappointing movie , but okay if you 're 10 or under .
pos	The One and only was a great film . I had just finished viewing it on EncoreW on DirecTV . I am an independent professional wrestler , and I thought this was a good portray of what life is like as a professional wrestler . Now this film was made 4 years before I was born , but I do n't think the rigors of professional wrestling traveling has changed all that much . Sad , funny , and all around GREAT ! ! ! * * * * 10 +
neg	This is going to be the most useless comment I have ever put down , but yet I must do it to warn you about the atrocity to cinema that " Freddy 's Dead " is . It is not only the very worst chapter of the Nightmare series , but is right up there with the worst horror sequel of all time ! It was boring , pointless , and nearly death free . The horrible 3-D ending and over - the - top CORNY kills are enough to drive this " film " into the ground . However , it does n't stop there , just add bad acting , a terrible script , and a number of cheesy cameos and you 've got yourself this heaping pile of guano ! It 's no wonder why Freddy , as always played by Robert Englund , has made two postmortem appearances . I would too if I went out like that . This is a strictly fans only movie , do n't stare at our shame .
pos	Are you a giraffe ? ... ask John to Nadia , and she , sure of responding well , responds him : yes . In this way begin the communication between a man and a woman who do n't know each other , and at the same time , the questions and doubts in " Birthday Girl " . A film that i heard a lot of times , but i do n't dare to see ... until two hours of write this . " Birthday Girl " is a passionate movie that makes me fall in count , at the same time , that Nicole Kidman is one of the best actress ( Besides she is pretty and intelligent ) that i have ever seen . " Birthday Girl " is the story of a lonely and routine man who looks for a wife at internet . The woman that he finds comes from Russia . She seems to be that delicate woman , normal , not more . One day , in her birthday comes suddenly , his cousin and his friend . The man , begin to discover certain things . Since here , he do n't going to be the lonely and routine man that always have been . Much of us going to think that this movie is just a regular one with a exploited plot . Much of us going to think that the action and thrills are sure and do n't novel . But " Birthday Girl " is just the opposite . This movie is full of good surprises , good performances and a imaginative plot that i had never seen and imagined . This romantic thriller with certain funny touch is an excellent natural film with a lot of proposes for the films of it kind . " Birthday Girl " have certain beauty and crudeness in its scenes , but at the same time , certain touching nature , and makes it so deeper . " Birthday Girl " is sometimes sad , sometimes funny , sometimes violent , but at the end , is totally satisfactory . And I 'm not sorry in say that this is a masterpiece . * Sorry for the mistakes ... well , if there any .
neg	This movie is so bad , I knew how it ends right after this little girl killed the first person . Very bad acting very bad plot very bad movie do yourself a favour and DON'T watch it 1/10
pos	Family is about two families who are after each other 's blood . Viren Sahay ( Amitabh Bachchan ) is an underworld don , operates from Bangkok . He has a family in India . Once by mistake he kills Shekhar ( Akshay Kumar ) . Like Viren Sahay , he also has a family ( a brother , wife and parents ) . Aryan ( Aryaman ) , Shekhar 's brother is out to take revenge of his brother 's death . He kidnaps Viren Sahay 's family for the same reason . The film has got one turning point ( Amitabh Bachchan ) . Second half of the movie belongs to him completely where instead of his dialogs , expression matters more . Akshay 's minuscule role has also put him at par with Amitabh . I did n't understand what Bhumika Chawala was doing in this movie . There were a few loose points in the script ; like ; Amitabh has been shown as the most wanted criminal of the city still he walks scot - free in the city . Kidnapping of his family is also seemed vague . How can the family of such a big don does n't have any security cover ?
neg	This is the most messed up entry on IMDb that I 've yet to stumble across . All the previous reviewers act like this is the movie . This is NOT the movie . Rather it 's merely a featurette that 's an extra on the DVD of the movie " The One " It also nowhere near being the 90 minutes that it 's listed here as . In actuality it 's barely over 13 minutes of how cool Jet Li can do martial arts . and his reflections on the movie . So yeah this IMDb entry is quite a bit fubar . Do n't listen to any of the other reviews as they are ALL wrong . You can trust me , because I never feed you , dear reader , BS . and that 's the truth . i guess u can say that i 'm " the One " Reviewer that matters .
pos	I have to tell you , this is a great movie . It surprises me sometimes how good a movie with no pretenses can be . This one is just fabulous . It could be that it is n't TRYING too hard to send any kind of message ; it just tells a whimsical , fun story . I gave it a 10 out of 10 .
neg	Abysmal with a capital " A " . This has got to be one of , if not THE , unfunniest show on TV right now . I 'm about as anti - bush as it gets , but this show does n't even get a chuckle out of me . What you think of Bush as a president has absolutely NOTHING to do with whether or not you 'll like this piece of crap show . The " jokes " are not funny at all . For example , in a scene when lil bush has his underwear on his head : " Welcome to camp al - qa - eeda ! " . There is NOTHING funny about that . Is it even supposed to be joke ? The commercials that were shown in the weeks leading up to the show , hyping it up , were funnier than the show itself , and that 's just sad . Hopefully this does not even get considered for a second season . It should n't even have had a first .
pos	Picked up the movie at the flea market for 4 bucks , sure did get my moneys worth!. Could care - less about the hot babes but the animation just blew me away after a steady diet of Simpsons ( Sorry Mr. Groening ) . The best part , facial expressions . Recommend multiple viewings with some cool tunes , good friends and a couple of cold ones !
neg	They 're showing this on some off - network . It 's well crap . While it is not as bad as the B - movies they show on the Sci - fi network on Saturdays but still a fairly large pile of crap . The acting is passable . The plot and writing are fairly sub - standard and the pacing is entirely too slow . Every minute of the movie feels like the part of the movie where they 're wrapping things up before the credits - not the peak of the movie , the denouement . Also , large portions of the cast look way to old for the age range they 're playing . The whole thing is predictable , boring and not worthy of being watched . Save your time . It 's not even worth the time it takes to watch it for free .
pos	Fire And Ice is an animated film set in a fantasy world . The film is about a village that is destroyed by a giant glacier which is the home of the evil ice lord named Nekron . The only survivor of the village is a young man named Larn who sets out to avenge those who were killed by the glacier . The ice glacier moves through the land of fire and the princess of the land named Teegra is kidnapped by evil creatures . Larn sets out to find her and also sets out to find and kill Nekron . Fire And Ice is directed by Ralph Bakshi who is one of my favourite adult animators . He has brought us such animated masterpieces as the film version of Fritz The Cat and some films he has written himself , like the great film Heavy Traffic . I did n't like Fire And Ice nearly as much as I have Ralph Bakshi 's other work , but I still found the film to be enjoyable . It had some very nice animation in parts and the story was entertaining enough . The only basic complaints I have is that I wish that there was more of a story to the film because the story it uses is very thin and there is not a lot to it . I also wish the film was a bit longer because it is under 80 minutes in running time . Still it 's an entertaining action adventure films that unlike Fritz The Cat or Heavy Traffic is appropriate for kids 8 and older . I only wish that there was a more developed story and it went on a bit longer than it did .
neg	Carrie Fisher has stated on more than one occasion that she made this movie during a period of her life when she had a heavy cocaine problem , and she does n't remember very much of it . That would explain why she made this film , but it does n't explain why anyone else in the cast or crew did ; I ca n't believe that EVERYBODY had a coke problem . This has to be one of the absolute worst movies ever made , and that 's saying something . The blame ca n't be laid at the feet of " director " Tim Kincaid or " writer " Buddy Giovinazzo , as it is obvious that this picture was n't written or directed by anyone . Apparently it just spontaneously came together , as there is little evidence of coherency , consistency , design , plot , sense , intelligence or anything else . What is really amazing is that there were some actual professionals who were involved in this glop . Co - star Robert Joy has done good work in other films , and composer Jimmie Haskell and cinematographer Arthur Marks are both industry veterans , Marks also having been a director , and not a bad one . Why they got involved in this steaming pile of offal is beyond comprehension . Tim Kincaid , the alleged " director " , has made quite a few low - rent sci - fi and horror films , and , having seen most of them , I can tell you that not a one of them is any good . This one , though , is by far the worst thing he 's ever done , and that is a major accomplishment on his part . Everything , absolutely EVERYTHING , about this movie is 12th - rate -- at best . The cinematography is terrible , the acting is laughable , the " special effects " make " Plan 9 From Outer Space " look like " Spider - Man " , the story is trite , derivative and stupid . Do n't waste your time even looking at the video box cover , let alone renting it . A complete , utter , annoying , total dud .
pos	This is definitely one of Jet 's best efforts . Few actors are able to play the stoic as Jet Li can . The action is rapid - fire , and special - effects boosted for intensity purposes . As a result , it may take Americans a little off - guard . A little suspension of disbelief goes a long way in a Jet Li film . I feel that it is an excellent introduction to Jet 's work and look forward to further masterpieces ( especially Fist of Legend ) making it into the US market . A nice mixture of gunplay and physical conflict will satisfy most action flick enthusiasts .
neg	Why , o ' WHY ! ... did I pick this one up ? Well ... i needed a no - brainer in the summer heat , and the cover looked cool . Of course I should 've known better . This is a really , really bad movie . And it gets embarasing when the makers know it 's bad , and try cover it up by adding some sexy / beautiful women , and some sex - scenes to it . Well , folks ... it does'nt cut it , does it ! If you WOULD like a cool movie about a big reptile that is actually very , very good , well - played and funny : go rent Lake Placid ! ( that is an order )
pos	The story turns around Antonio ' Scarface ' Montana , an ultra - violent Cuban refugee who comes to the United States with less than nothing , and makes a place for himself at the top of the cocaine trade ... As a calculating man with a conscience , and extreme ambitions , Tony strongly begins to desire the things he sees a criminal high - roller enjoying , including his luscious lover ... Heights his way out of a refugee camp by enjoying the chance to stab a former taker of Freedom , takes out rival dealers , gains the confidence of an important drug lord by eclipsing a local gang boss in Miami , and eventually makes it to the highest levels of the drug organization ... Pacino shows the results of greed and lust for power on the human psyche ... He guns his way through the sunny streets of Miami where he got ' the world and everything in it .

He quickly moves deep to the world of gangs , and becomes more ruthless than anyone else can possibly imagine ... Michelle Pfeiffer looks dazzling as the addicted wife with no inner life ... She succeeds in portraying the trophy ' object ' navigating uncertain waters with her anti - hero ... Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio happens to be the best in Tony 's life , the only thing that is good and pure ... Her revulsion at the end of the movie is so fiery that her whole head could have blown off ... Robert Loggia exhibits a weak and fearful disposition , especially when faced with Pacino as a challenger ... He proves to be a less - ambitious boss in a position of power ... Steven Bauer shines as the man of charm , loyal ally and faithful friend ... The Oliver Stone - scripted ' Scarface ' is a change in genre , lifting scene after scene of Hawks ' classic while updating the rise - and - fall gangster saga to modern , drug - infested Miami ... But , as always , the focus is on decadence , profanity and violencememorably a sickening chainsaw murder , rather than on the psychological and social reasons for the hoodlum 's psychopathic behavior ...
neg	I saw this movie a couple years back . I could'nt sleep and there was nothing on . So I peeped it . What really gets me is it makes no sense and that s why its disturbing . Richard gets tied up in chicken wire and Jarvis starts making out with Richard 's girl while she 's unconscious . Then Jarvis 's buddy Troubador is playing some stupid song on his guitar . By the next morning it shows Richard 's girl talking to Jarvis and Trouby and then she walks back to Richard and looks at him while he 's still tied up . Then they play some happy music and the movie is finished . I mean what happened ? Did they brake up ? And what was she saying to those 2 guys(Trouby and Jarvis ) ? Its to puzzling and to poor to . I ca n't stand movies that are disturbing and do n't make sense . This was the worst film i 've ever seen since the 90 's version of Lord of the Flies .
pos	I 'll be honest with you ... I liked this movie . It 's a great zombie flick that is packed with action , original ideas , good acting , but is also packed with bad Zombie effects . Part IV , entitled " After Death " is also good . I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere . 10 out of 10 Fans of Horror Movies like this should Check out Puppet Master , Skinned Alive , Slumber Party Massacre , Sleep Away Camp , and other Full Moon Pictures flicks . For other recommendations , check out the other comments I have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section .
neg	Since this picture is classified a " pure entertainment " work and since there are already many comments on it , I 'd like hereby to address something relevant to the abuse of humour . We can see that Marlon Wayans is playing the joker role in this film . Certainly as long as he has been involved in the casting job , he has always been acting as a little man - an actor can change his customary dress but can hardly change his physical appearance - and the latter one can be an advantage when necessary . However far away from what I expected , I saw an image very disguising , pretending to expose different aspects of the baby life by mistake of a forty - year- old criminal . And with a ridiculous happy ending . So what is the point ? Many elements are mixed up , some principal ones are violence , sex and criminal activities , amongst which the story is badly composed and to some extent , lack common sense : where is Vanessa when the peace of her house is violated and her husband 's life being pursued ? In addition the diamond is even bigger than the world 's No.1 Cullinan ! But the most sickening facet is the continuous attempt to make up the little man as a superman by showing his physical weak points . And they call it humour . A diamond is precious , hard and fragile ; it can not be cut by any other material but only be conquered by the hot blood of a male goat . Hence it 's no more a diamond but pieces of debris .
pos	A remarkable piece of documentary , giving a vivid depiction of a country deeply divided within itself ( for further evidence , check out some of the comments on IMDb ... ! ) . Compares extremely favourably with Oliver Stone 's " Comandante " ( which is mainly an in - depth examination of Fidel Castro 's nostril hairs ) . I do n't know whether Chavez is everything he presents himself as being , or yet another in the long line of populist Latin - American " caudillos " . Nor do I know whether he will be able to make good on the huge expectations he has clearly built up among the poor majority of Venezuelans . It 's hardly reasonable to expect a film like this to be able to answer such questions - but I 've certainly now got a pretty vivid idea of what 's at stake , and what it feels like to be caught up in the middle of a coup . Someone says in the film " we 're making history " , and that 's exactly what the film feels like it 's capturing . Outstanding stuff .
neg	The Brothers Quay are directors , judging by conventional thought , should have stuck to making short films . I myself actually really liked their first feature , Institute Benjamenta , but judging by their sophomore effort , The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes , I 'm willing to agree they do n't come close to equaling their past genius at feature length . Piano Tuner is , without a doubt , a gorgeous film to look at , and often to listen to . Unfortunately , it 's borderline painful to sit through with its convoluted narrative and glacial pace . Reading the plot synopsis , it sounds like a pretty good story . But the Brothers fail miserably to bring it to life . One thing they should consider avoiding completely in the future : dialogue . My God , it 's awful here . A huge bust .
pos	Could not understand why Jeremy Irons felt it necessary to exhibit a most disconcerting accent , spoken through clenched teeth , and from the back of his throat . In fact it rather spoiled the film for me , and distracted from what was probably a fine performance by him ( very irritating ) . No other actor or actress seemed to have such a pronounced accent and whilst I have always rated Jeremy Irons as a fine actor , I would not class this film as being one of his best . The film however has whetted my appetite , as have some of the other comments made re this film , which I have found very interesting , and intend to now read the book .
neg	Simply put , this is a simplistic and one dimensional film . The title , The Rise to Evil , should tell you that this is n't going to attempt to be anything deep or do much with Hitler 's character . Rather , from the first minutes of the movie where we see baby Hitler looking evil with evil music playing the background , we are given a view of Hitler that presents his as a cartoony supervillian , seemingly ripped right out of a Saturday morning TV show . The film REALLY wants to make its case that Hitler was evil but does anyone need a movie to convince them that Hitler was evil ? Ultimately , making him such a one - dimensionally evil character is both boring and confusing ( one must ask how the inept , phsycotic character in the film cold ever persuade a nation to follow him or be named Time 's man of the year ) . This film had a great opportunity to take a figure who has committed some of the most horrible acts in the 20th century , and try to delve into his mind . Instead , it basically just says , " Hey ! Hitler was evil ! Just thought you might like to know ... " over and over again . The great irony is that the film still was attacked for presenting too sympathetic a view of the character . Give me a break .
pos	What 's the best way to start a review of a movie like Der Todesking ? Let me start by saying I 've just come direct from viewing this movie , and the images are still burned deep into my brain - and I do n't think they 'll be moving any time soon . It 's probably fair to say that if you 're on this page you have a good idea what sort of film this is even if you have n't seen it . If not , let me forewarn you that this is not a moderate - budget gem that 's been lost for a few years a la " Near Dark " , nor is it a low budget , schlocky , " fun " B - movie . What it is it low - budget art , put forward in a simple yet poignant way . The idea is a simple one - seven stories revolving around , and ending in , suicides interspersed with footage of a decomposing corpse . Sounds simple right , even boring ? It is n't . Words ca n't really describe how powerful this film becomes by the time you are halfway through ; it virtually draws you into it whether you want to go or not . I could go on a ramble here about the technical pros and cons of the direction ; maybe point out that the scenes are obviously shot on super-8 cameras and are at sometimes shaky . I could point out that some of the sound effects are out - of - sync in a way to rival any Fulci movie , but at the end of the day this all seems to pale into insignificance . As far as extreme movies go , I 've seen the hardest of them , and yet Der Todesking moved me in a way that few others have managed , despite not being particularly gory and having very few scenes that I would consider " gratuitous " . In fact , the most disturbing scene I found was the last tale . I wo n't ruin it , just to say that the character 's emotional agony virtually drips from the screen and makes you sympathise , if not yearn for his end .   Sure , it 's not the best movie ever made , and in a lot of places is seems crude and maybe a little amateurish , but in spite of these flaws Der Todesking is an experience I would recommend to anyone who likes challenging cinema . If you 're someone who likes comfortable viewing or " nice " movies , or simply wants to gross out on something brutal and pointless , this is not what you 're looking for .   Whether you enjoy it or not , It 's one you wo n't forget in a hurry .
neg	As a young black / latina woman I am always searching for movies that represent the experiences and lives of people like me . Of course when I saw this movie at the video store I thought I would enjoy it ; unfortunately , I did n't . Although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant , the story was simply not properly developed . The movie just kept dragging on and on and many of the characters that appear on screen just come and go without much to contribute to the overall film . Had the director done a better job interconnecting the scenes , perhaps I would have enjoyed it a bit more . Honestly , I would recommend a film like " Raising Victor " over this one any day . I just was not too impressed .
pos	Youth , sexuality , and the French countryside -- one of the more unique films you 're ever going to see . If you can see it that is , no mean feat considering how hard it is to find copies of it ( a combination of scarcity and censorship . ) It 's sometimes erotic , sometimes disgusting , and occasionally funny . A trifle boring also in the middle , but all in all you ca n't call yourself an aficionado of bizarre film until you 've seen this one at least once .
neg	A somewhat awkward spy mystery with a predictable plot about World War Two dangers . The mystery is whether or not Jane Graystone ( Nancy Coleman ) has amnesia . The best acting is done by Raymond Massey as Dr. Ingersoll , a good doctor turned evil . He is head of a spy ring attempting to get information from amnesiac Jane , coded information related to allied activities . Will she tell ? Can she remember ? Moroni Olson ( as Mr. Goodwin ) is convincing as an accomplice to Massey . The role played by John Garfield ( as Dr. Lewis ) is nothing short of disastrous . He seems so badly miscast that the casting has to be ranked as one of the worst in film history . It is unfortunate that so talented an actor is stuffed into a role which not befitting his talents . The movie is worth one look , despite being a half spy and half gangster film , and despite containing a parade of stereotyped characters . It 's easy to forget this one , amnesia is not necessary .
pos	I finally purchased and added to my collection a copy of " Show People " . I can not comment any more than what previous viewers have stated and to the characters , plot and overall quality of this film without repeating their own words . Seeing the cameo , out - of - character appearances of so many M - G - M silent stars is worth the viewing in and of itself . I really like the scene where Marion Davies plays herself and is encountered by herself playing the main character of the movie , Patricia Pepoire . Make sure you read her lips as there is no title card indicating what she is saying when she sees Marion Davies but it is something to the effect of " I do n't think I like her ! " Pop the corn , pop in the tape and get ready to go back more than three quarters of a century in movie making history . Enjoy !
neg	This movie is an insult to ALL submariners . It was stupid . It appeared to have been written by monkeys . The acting was absurd . If this is the view most people have of the Navy , then I weep for our defense . This movie was awful . I put it below " Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea " as far as submarine movies go . Gene Hackman must have really needed rent money to do this crap . Denzel Washington must have been high . Little in the plot makes any sense . And the ending . For a mutineer to be rewarded for his crime ? Only Hollywood would think of this garbage . If you have n't figured it out yet , I did n't like it . And if it was n't for all the pro comments , I would not have bothered to post .
pos	Salva and his pal Bigardo have been at the margin of the law during most of their lives . We see them panhandling in a car of the underground , where their pitch to get donations is so lame , no one gives them anything ! Salva , who is a hardened petty criminal does n't even have any redeeming qualities , that is , until he discovers a reality show on television that gives him the idea of what to do next . Religion and show business prove to be a winning combination , something that Salva capitalizes on . He and Bigardo have been in jail after the accidental death of a priest that was critical of the duo . Salva shows he is a natural for the reality show . He transforms himself into a Christ - like figure who is an instant success in the program . Espe , who is a no - nonsense woman who is show 's producer , ca n't escape from the way Salva pays her unusual attention . Ultimately , Salva is the victim of his own success in the end . Jordi Molla , whose first directorial job this movie is , had some success in the way the film satirizes the role of television . Spain , which was vulnerable to these types of programs , has seen its share of the bizarre , which is what the director felt is an assault on the viewing public and wanted to set his story from the point of view of the people that are making a fortune out of the naive audience . The ensemble cast has some good moments in the film . Mr. Molla , like any actor who decides to direct his first feature , would have been more effective concentrating on the picture in front of the camera . Candela Pena , a good actress , is one of the best reasons for watching the movie . Juan Carlos Villedo , David Gimenez Cacho , Franco Francescoantonio , Florinda Chico and the rest responded well to the new director .
neg	I ordered the movie from Korea because I was an extra in it and was interested to see how it turned out . Having watched it I can say that I am ashamed to have had any part of it . I feel embarrassed not only for myself but for everyone else who had any part in the making of this mockery of British " comedy " . From beginning to end the film is predictable , tedious , dull , monotonous and cringe - worthy to the point that on several occasions I actually looked away from the screen in dis - belief . Until you actually see the movie it is difficult to conceive how un - romantic and un - comedic a romantic comedy can be . It 's not only a bad story , but a badly - made film . In one scene , you can actually see a runner or assistant director showing the S.A. 's when to wipe across . I will post details of this in the ' Goofs ' section . On the up - side , it did fill me with emotions ( disappointment , rage , embarrassment  )
pos	Maybe I loved this movie so much in part because I 've been feeling down in the dumps and it 's such a lovely little fairytale . Whatever the reason , I thought it was pitch perfect . Great , intelligent story , beautiful effects , excellent acting ( especially De Niro , who is awesome ) . This movie made me happier than I 've been for a while . It is a very funny and clever movie . The running joke of the kingdom 's history of prince savagery and the aftermath , the way indulging in magic effects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled . That 's much of what makes it so good ; it 's an elaborate , special - effects - laden movie with more story than most fairytale movies , yet there is an incredible attention to small things . I feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again .
neg	Despite the overwhelming cult following for this sad " documentary , " I must admit to having cordially loathed the film which struck our party as far more a distressing exploitation piece than usefully informative . That said , after seeing the magnificent stage musical drawn from it , one can appreciate what the film might have been in surer hands .   One suspects that those many of us who actively suffered through the film may have had any campy delights its crueler fans enjoyed destroyed by the uncomfortable suspicion that too many of us - or those we know - are only a misstep or two away from the deplorable plight of the two mad women depicted who live in and contribute to a squalor they seem incapable of controlling or escaping . The film leaves the viewer desperately wondering how any person could have slid to this level of degradation and , unlike the musical , offers no cautionary clues or explanations , only a horror show unredeemed by humor or insight .   This soul crushing flatness of the film makes the achievement of the stage version ( hopefully to be filmed ultimately for cable ) all the more remarkable . Act II is faithful in almost every detail to the film under discussion but strangely , setting the sad inmates ' plight to music , raises the human tragedy to art . Even more important , this act is preceded by a fine Act I where we meet the women before their decent into mutually enabled madness , and are offered hints how their isolated purgatory came about . In short , everything which the FILM is lacking . To the filmmakers ' credit ( or their successors ) , the excellent Criterion DVD release includes out - takes and bonus material that partially redeem the main film - behind the scenes photographs , interviews and commentary - filling in some of the blank spots the original editing consciously decided to omit in its drive for unadulterated horror and depression . They ca n't make the amateurish film itself satisfying , but they can at least make it a bit more comprehensible .   Ultimately though , it is only the remarkable stage piece inspired by and drawn from it by book writer Doug Wright , composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie which raises the rating of the original GREY GARDENS above a single ( generous ) star .
pos	WHITE FIRE was recommended to me by a guy who owns it on two separate DVD releases and on VHS . He claimed it 's one of the funniest and coolest low budget actioners ever made . I generally do n't watch movies knowing that they 're going to be bad , but I made an exception for this one ... and I was very glad that I did . It 's filled to the brim with action ( much of it surprisingly , graphically gory ) , sleaze ( isolated to nudity with a key female character , but there 's so much of it in one scene that it becomes hilarious ) and outrageously awkward dialogue , all of which adds to the laughter - inducing tone of the film . Ginty , the unusual looking star of THE EXTERMINATOR ( and countless other low budget action turds ) is amusing in the lead , giving the best performance he could muster . Williamson is better than usual , clearly hamming it up with unparalleled glee ( and he does n't come in until midway through ) . The rest of the cast is also fun to watch , particularly the villains , one of whom is a sadistic sexpot who speaks with an accent that appears to be a mish - mash of Spanish and Italian . She 's priceless . Again , I ca n't stress enough how gory it was . It 's not so bloody that it 's nauseating , but it 's uncommonly violent in parts with some meaty squibs going off in the shootouts and it has a grueling torture sequence that no man will soon forget . Also , when Ginty is being swarmed by a pack of bad guys , he conveniently gets a hold of a chainsaw and the splatter moments that follow will have any and all action fans cheering and spilling their beers . Do n't miss WHITE FIRE . It 's a rollicking - if mind - numbingly stupid - action classic .
neg	Okay , I seriously CAN'T think of anything worse than the PR series . There are many bad things in life ... traitors , liars , etc . But seriously , Power Rangers has GOT to be at the bottom of this list . Can you think of anything more stupid than five - six teenagers ( who do n't even act like a normal teen ) dancing around in identical suits WITH DIFFERENT COLORS SO THAT YOU CAN TELL THEM APART ? Fans , have you ever come across a real person who gets flung against a mental wall and gets up almost immediately and continues to fight without getting injured ? Power Rangers are for five - year old boys , and believe me , I never liked this show even when I was five . I guess you can say Dino Thunder is an exception . The teens actually ACT like teens , and Tommy Oliver actually acts like a mentor , or no , a teacher . It 's got teen - humor , though the fighting is lame , I do n't hate Dino Thunder . Many people say Power Rangers are crap , but I would n't . It would be an insult to crap . So face it , five year old boys , Power Rangers is rubbish .
pos	This film is one of Tom Cruise 's finest films . He captures the audiences imaginations with his role of David Aames . His character can relate to us all in some way . The story line is very clever and keeps the audience on edge throughout the whole film . I never really watched Cruise movies that much before but after seeing this it shows me his true talent . My favourite part in the movie is the end where it all comes to a big conclusion and he find out the truth . If you have not seen this yet you definitely should give it a try . It 's one of those films that once you 've started watching it you just got to see it until the end or it will keep you thinking and you will regret it . My opinion is you should just go buy it and take a risk that s what I did and it became one of my favourite films of all time . It 's A * 10/10 I promise once you watch it , it will stick with you and you will like it forever .
neg	This 1973 remake of the classic 1944 Billy Wilder film , " Double Indemnity , " is a textbook example of how to destroy a great script . This grade - B TV fodder also illustrates the folly of remakes in general . While Hollywood has gone after greedy executives that colorize black - and - white films and sought disclaimers on wide - screen movies that are shown in pan - and - scan versions , the industry has ignored the hacks that insist on taking a classic film and diminishing it with a shoddy remake . The first step in producing a bowdlerized version of a classic is to edit the script . The Billy - Wilder - Raymond - Chandler work was cut by a half hour to fit the finished film into a specified time - slot with room for commercials . Then update the production with bland , color photography , smart , upscale sets , and TV - familiar actors . Thus , the brand - new " Double Indemnity " eliminates the atmospheric black - and - white film - noir cinematography that enhanced the mood and characterizations of the original . Gone are the dusty , shadowy , claustrophobic sets that explained the protagonists ' desires to escape their situations at whatever cost . Gone are the close bond between Keyes and Neff and the erotic attraction between Neff and Phyllis . The look of Jack Smight 's take on " Double Indemnity " is more " Dynasty " than film noir . Phyllis Dietrickson has a designer home to die for , and Neff 's comfy pad would be hard to afford on an insurance salesman 's salary , not to mention the sporty Mercedes convertible that he drives . Neither character has any apparent motive to murder for a paltry $ 200,000 . If not money , then perhaps murder for love or lust ? Not in this version . Richard Crenna shows little interest in Samantha Eggar , and their kisses are about as lusty as those between a brother and a sister . Crenna fails to capture the cynicism of Neff , and his attempts at double - entendre and sexual suggestiveness fall horribly flat . Eggar is little better and lacks sensuality and the depth to suggest the inner workings of a supposedly devious and manipulative mind . Only Lee J. Cobb manages a creditable performance as Keyes . Director Jack Smight and his three principals have all done much better work . There was no conceivable reason to produce this wretched remake except to fill time in a broadcast schedule . There was no conceivable reason to resurrect this dud on DVD and package it with the original film except to fill out a double - disc package . The only lesson that can be learned from this misfire is that even a great script and great dialog can be ruined with poor casting , lackluster direction , and TV grade production values . The 1973 " Double Indemnity " should be titled " 10 % Indemnity , " because viewing it only underscores the 100 % perfection of the original movie .
pos	I 've read most of the comments here . I came to the conclusion that almost everybody agrees that 9/11 is a shocking piece of history . There are a few who think that the added narrative is weak and   I agree that the narrative is weak and unnecessary . About two brothers finding each other back after the disaster and the cliff hanger about Tony . But I do n't think narration is unnecessary . Like I lot of theorists I think that our own lives are narrations . We are living and making our own autobiography . So if we tell about our lives this is always in the form of narration . We do n't sum up facts like : Birth , Childhood , High School etc . We create a story about our live . Because we are familiar with stories , we want to put history in a story as well . Because in the form of a story we can identify ourselves . We can better understand the things happened in history when its told in the form of a story . So that 's the purpose of adding a story in documentary . The story is weak , so be it , but we understand what s going on . If it was me out there I would be worried sick about my brother . And the second point , making a blockbuster movie about it . True , it 's been to recent to come up with a big movie about 9/11 . Though , there have been a few about the subject , but none of them like this documentary . But what if there will be a movie in about 5 years ? I agree it is wrong trying to make a lot of money out of 9/11 . But I also agree that movies are one of the best way to tell history . How many movies about the World war 2 have we seen ? If I had not seen these movies my view of the WW would me totally different . I remember seeing Schindlers List , and I cried for an hour during class . Movies give you a good image of the things that happened in history and although it is fiction it contributes to the memory of the disasters and the casualties .   So my point : telling stories is not always bad , it makes us identify with the story , and makes us never forget what happened .
neg	I think that movie can`t be a Scott`s film . That is impossible . Do you remember Blade Runner ? And Alien ? Two greats movies versus a one . I hope didn´t see ever it . good bye ! !
pos	Another very good Mann flick thanks to the father / son combination of Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart . Brennan ( Ben Tatum ) is often the comedic conscience of either Stewart or Wayne ( Red River/ Rio Bravo ) . He 's there to see that the younger man takes the ride fork or bend . " You 're wrong Mr. Dunston " . Jeff Webster(Stewart ) gives off the impression he cares only for himself but it is clear he can not desert Brennan . John McIntire is excellent as the law of Skagway with due respect for the trappings of justice over the reality of it . Another key theme is helping people and in turn being helped by people . The loner can do neither and suffers for it . The caption above plays on Tatum 's assertion that he ca n't live without his coffee . This nicotine addiction proves fatal . Probably the first and last time on the screen . I recommend this film and now own the DVD .
neg	Well this is the first post am ever commenting on IMDb . , do you get it , this movie has made me come and warn all the good souls who will stop ever experimenting with movies . As most of them have given their comments I thought of watching this movie because it seemed to have some decent actors(though having read worst critics against this movie ) I thought of experimenting it assuming it to be some comedy flick . , Well it all started well with some ahem . , comedies .... then it all started going pathetic ... man you can believe your self , you wud feel like going and banging your head each and every time the pathetic looking woman called the heroine of the movie is made helpless ... Huh~~ Well how much can a person digest a sick all POSSESSIVE witch kinda ghost trying to do all she can to irritate you and stop you from what you are doing . The next worst thing about the movie is , the " ZOMBIE " Hero , yes as he looses his fiancé he roams around like a Goat , with black marks under his eyes . , and with the hero 's " terribly stupid " sister .. you wud be bleeding from head to toe if you attempted and succeeded by completely watching this movie~ !
pos	The 40 Year Old Virgin , is about Andy Stitzer , a forty year old man who works in an electronic store and does n't have much of a social life and is very awkward around women . Some of his co - workers at the store invite him out one night and they discover that Andy , is still a virgin so they plan to help him lose his virginity . One day in the store Andy , meets a woman named Trish , who gives him her phone number and eventually Andy , works up enough courage to go on a date with her and they start to really like each other but Andy , is still very awkward when it comes to sex and he is going to have to tell this to Trish , much to his embarrassment if he can actually get up enough courage to tell her before things get awkward . The 40 Year Old Virgin , has good direction , a good script , good comedic performances by the whole cast , good cinematography and good film editing . The film stars and is co - written by Steve Carell , who does a very good comedic breakthrough performance and his writing for the film is very good too . I was very pleasantly surprised with this film . It is sweet , funny , entertaining , fun , enjoyable , clever , good natured and a good time . This film is just as good as this year 's Wedding Crashers , and both films are two of the best comedies I have seen in awhile . The 40 Year Old Virgin , really showcases a lot of talent and it is put to good use and it works as a comedy and a romance and it is sweet and a lot of fun . One of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year .
neg	i was enjoying this movie most of the time , but i kept getting the feeling that i was watching a children 's movie . i honestly think that somebody wrote a pg script and then , while filming , decided to add in some blood , nudity and language . it was a big let down . there 's that believe the children magic that exists in movies like " babe " ( the pig ) or " angels in the outfield " that defeats the evil tooth fairy . the parents end up believing their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and utilize this skill to supernaturally defeat the tooth fairy . when i bought this movie , i thought it would be a b - film response to the dreadful darkness falls ; somehow manage to make a better film with 1/4 of the money , but they do n't . they made a worse film and will probably lose the same proportion of money lost on darkness falls .
pos	This light hearted comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment value . It gets quite hysterically funny at times , but if you have n't spent any time on ' that ' side of the tracks you will miss the comedy when it erupts . The cast of characters meld well together and are quite believable in their roles . How Grace handles meeting her dead husbands girlfriend was well played . She 's a true lady . And , my favorite is Grace 's white pimp suit that she wears . I highly recommend this flick to anyone who wants to laugh out loud , who cheers for the underdog or just wishes to watch something different .
neg	While I do n't claim to be any sort of expert in marine life , I must say anyone with a modicum of intelligence could not possibly buy in to this notion of a whale ( and not even the mother ! ) having a clue about revenge because it witnessed his dead mate having a forced abortion by humans ! I mean , really ! This is basically the whole plot . Richard Harris must have been extremely hard up for roles to have accepted this junk . This is the kind of movie that is so bad that if you paid 50 cents to see it , you would feel like demanding your money back .
pos	This is the best dub I 've ever heard by Disney , as well as the best adaptation since the biggest abuse ever on soundtrack , themes , characters , dialogues in Kiki Delivery Service . Urrrghhh This one has different atmosphere , especially the deviation from the common heroine . This one has both hero and heroine ( although I do n't really endorse the use of hero & heroine here , since Miyazaki is out from the stereotype & common theme ) . As usual , after being introduced by Spirited away , amazed by Mononoke , troubled by Grave of Fireflies , and deeply touched by Majo no Takkyuubin , this one start with a bit doubt in my part . Wondering if this will be the first Ghibi 's dud . Well , in the end just like Only Yesterday and Whisper of the Heart , I ended up giving 10 rating . I 'd give 9.8 rating , but the additional 0.2 is there to share the good feeling by encouraging people to see the movie . SPOILER Somehow I see this as a sad movie , people die in this one , the lonely robot , the abandoned place , and it ends with destruction . It is as if mankind really ca n't live with too much power . The collapsing scene gave me patches of Metropolis ending . It 's just sad somehow . The plot is apparent in most reviews and the soundtrack rules as well ( as always ) . Joe Hisaishi really belongs to Uematsu , Kanno , Williams caliber . People who can brings a movie , a game , an event to life , even to be a lingering moments by astounding composition . This is a feel good movie that used to be part of US cinema in the classic days ( It 's a Wonderful Life etc etc ) . Well , things change ....
neg	A film like Amazing Grace and Chuck is a perfect example of how the left in this country just does n't get it . They never did . And liberalism continues to slip further and further into political oblivion . This film deals with a little league baseball star who decides to stop playing ball as a protest to the existence of nuclear weapons . The boy is understandably ridiculed until a bevy of professional athletes , led by former NBA star Alex English , join his cause . Not just a few of them join the cause . By the time his movement reaches its zenith , entire leagues of professional and college sports have to cancel their seasons since nobody will play any more . Just to move this review along , I 'm prepared to grant them this premise . Even though it would never happen in a million years , I 'll just imagine it could , then go from there . I do n't quite remember how , but some type of agreement is reached , and the boy decides to go back to the game he loves in an incredibly sappy and ridiculous scene . Before criticizing the message of this film , let me just say that this film is poorly written , acted and directed . Even if one does agree with the boy 's stance , it would be impossible to overcome how badly the film was constructed . And that 's a shame since there are plenty of good actors that go to waste . ( Peck , Curtis , Petersen ) . Alex English does as well as he could have with his character however , and I wish he would try to act in more films . Alas , it 's likely much easier to find work in the coaching world of the NBA . One wishes Mr. English would teach more of these thuggish NBA types of today how to shoot the rock a little better . Alex certainly knew how to put the ball through the hoop . As far as the film 's message in concerned , it 's just wrong - headed . Plain and simple . All of those nuclear warheads tucked away in those missile silos out west PREVENTED WAR ! ! ! ! ! It would be one thing for this boy and his flock to protest an actual war or the USE of nuclear weapons . These weapons were in fact never used , and that was the genius behind their existence . Neither side during the cold war was crazy enough to fire a single missile . Without these weapons , who knows what might have happened between the USA and USSR . The makers of this film obviously intended for kids in America to take up their cause and follow in Chuck 's footsteps . Kids in America however are more intelligent than the left wing kooks who created this dreck .   The film is worth only 2 of 10 stars . If you want to see a great film about the dangers of nuclear war , stick with Dr. Strangelove , instead . Mr. Newell , you are no Frank Capra !
pos	It is quite a simple not very active but very charming film . There were moments where I can see why Cher won the Academy Award for Best Actress , but there were other times when I wondered why Glenn Close did n't win for Fatal Attraction . Anyway , Oscar and Golden Globe winning , and BAFTA nominated Cher plays Loretta Castorini , a simple woman with a low pay job who has just been asked by Mr. Johnny Cammareri ( Danny Aiello ) to marry him . He promises her he 'll be back in a month , as his mother is sick , so she mean while needs to get as much of his family to attend the wedding as possible . Only problem is , when she finds Johnny 's one - handless brother Ronny ( Golden Globe nominated Nicolas Cage ) , they start having a relationship , and there love goes on to that moon scene ( where the title comes from ) . Also starring Oscar nominated Vincent Gardenia as Cosmo Castorini , Oscar , BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Olympia Dukakis as Rose Castorini and John Mahoney as Perry . It ends with no wedding for Johnny and Loretta , but she and Ronny were happy together . It won the Oscar for Best Writing , Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen , and it was nominated for Best Director for Norman Jewison ( In the Heat of the Night ) and Best Picture , it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Score for Dick Hyman and Best Original Screenplay , and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy / Musical and Best Screenplay . It was number 96 on 100 Years , 100 Quotes ( " Snap out of it ! " ) , it was number 17 on 100 Years , 100 Passions , and it was number 41 on 100 Years , 100 Laughs . Very good !
neg	Watched on Hulu ( far too many commercials ! ) so it broke the pacing but even still , it was like watching a really bad buddy movie from the early sixties . Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis where both parts are played by Jerry Lewis . If I were Indian , I 'd protest the portrayal of all males as venal and all women as shrews . They cheated for the music videos for western sales and used a lot of western models so the males could touch them I usually enjoy Indian films a lot but this was a major disappointment , especially for a modern Indian film . The story does n't take place in India ( the uncle keeps referring to when Mac will return to India ) but I ca n't find out where it is supposed to be happening .
pos	I agree with the previous comment in naming the film 's content " everyday madness " but would like to specify that : " Dog Days " is about how women are treated in ( a male ) society . The episodes we get to see here show some variation in everyday discrimination of women , mostly categorized by age group . There is a senior man who makes his new partner look and act the way his late wife had , treating her like a doll that shall act " worthy of wearing " the former 's dress . There is a middle - aged couple in whose relationship she is nearly a slave and he a ( violent ) master . Further we find a somewhat younger man who does not communicate with his friend / wife and instead of being really jealous about her affairs even makes friendship with his competitor(s ) . A young adult man makes clear to his friend - a girl who is really troubled by being pretty enough for him - that she has to be the jewelry at his side and to follow his narrow viewed rules of etiquette . Finally there is a man in his late fifties who calculating his own advantage delivers a simple - minded hitchhiking woman to a furious client who - taking her for guilty in having scratched his car - natural beats her up . To complete the examples we find the pal of the man in the " master - slave "- couple - after collectively abusing her - threatening and humiliating the former " in her sake " for she shall get rid of her partner and take himself as her new " master " . During all this the inhabitants of the lately built neighborhood in which the action takes place rests under the burning summer - sun - absolutely motionless ( sic ! ) . Unfortunately I have not seen the last minutes of this shocking and authentic portray of the archaic structures that still reign in the relationship between women and men , but what I have seen convincingly analyzed the repertoire of discrimination . Probably a helpful tool in teaching even the less sensitive spectator what goes wrong - due to good visualization .
neg	How can a major German TV station broadcast a mess like this ? It 's amazing how the main actors avoid every acting talent - Even the well - known Gottfried John is acting very poor - especially in the double murder scene - how amateurish ....... ! The screen plan is very , very extended - perhaps to fill out 2 parts of the movie . Be careful not to fall asleep while watching ! The set is obviously very often a blue screen , f.g . the scenes on the ship with unreal sea in background ... ! In the German version the sound and the dubbing is very poor - probably reason : different languages of actors - but : other international productions do handle this much more professional . Advice : Do NOT watch - it 's a diabolic waste of time !
pos	What a stunning episode for this fine series . This is television excellence at its best . The story takes place in 1968 and it 's beautifully filmed in black & white , almost a film noir style with its deep shadows and stark images . This is a story about two men who fall in love , but I do n't want to spoil this . It is a rare presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in America . Written by the superb Tom Pettit , and directed by the great Jeannot Szwarc , we move through their lives , their love for each other , and their tragedy . Taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more stunning . Our emotions are as torn and on edge as the characters . Chills ran up my spine at the end when they played Bob Dylan 's gorgeous , " Ah , but I was so much older then , I 'm younger than that now , " as sung by the Byrds . This one goes far past a 10 and all the way to the stars . Beautiful .
neg	I opted to see the film at the recent Dubai Film Festival because it had been selected to the Cannes film festival 's prestigious Competition section . I was surprised that Cannes could be so off the mark in judging quality . The film , some reviewers , have noted does not have too much of gunfire -- but the inherent violence is repulsive . Imagine killing your enemy / competitor in front of your young son .. or forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove loyalty . There are some hints of the contrasting Corleone sons in Copolla 's " Godfather " that seem to resurface here in this Chinese / Hong Kong film but the quality of the two are as distinctly different as chalk and cheese . This film is only recommended for violence junkies .. there is no great cinema here . At best it might be considered to be better than the usual Run Run Shaw production for production values .
pos	Brothers with psychokinetic powers ( yes , really ) duel not just for Debra Winger 's affections but really over a secret from their childhood that left them at odds over their powers . There are surreal touches ( the fire brigade that act like a singing Greek chorus ) , but there is also humour and romance . The soundtrack is great similar to the way American Werewolf in London used every great Wolf song they could get ~ but with fire ~ and I do n't think I 'll ever forget Dennis Quaid ( mmmmm Dennis Quaid ) , setting his own trailer a rockin ' to ' She 's a lady ' ~ priceless ;) Best line missing from the quotes section btw ~ ' Once you 've had a clown , you never go back ! ' I love this movie ( I ordered the DVD from the US ) and if the comments written by the kind of people who 'd be happier with Legally Blond 3 do n't put you off ~ give it a try :)
neg	I rented this movie because it falls under the genres of " romance " and " western " with some Grand Canyon scenery thrown in . But if you 're expecting a typical wholesome romantic western , forget it . This movie is pure trash ! The romance is between a YOUNG GIRL who has not even gone through puberty and a MIDDLE - AGED MAN ! The child is also lusted after by other leering men . It 's sickening . Peter Fonda is portrayed as being virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to Brooke Shields , and her character is mostly the one that pursues the relationship . He tries to shoo her off at first but eventually he gives in and they drive off as a happy , loving couple . It 's revolting . I do n't see how this movie could appeal to anyone except pedophiles .
pos	Not a movie for everyone , but this movie is in my top 10 . I am a lover of black comedy . With a cast including Richard Dreyfus ( Vic ) , Jeff Goldblum ( Mick ) , Larry Bishop ( Nick ) and Gabriel Byrne ( Ben ' Brass Balls ' London ) in the leads , the lines ca n't help but be dry . The supporting cast is nearly dead center . Counting the minor flaws in the movie : Ellen Barkin 's make - up gave her face has a washed out look ; there were a couple of gimme cameos by Joey Bishop and Richard Pryor that served no purpose , and Michael J. Pollard 's screen time was too short . Over all , the cast was just incredible without egos to wreck a fine script . If you have seen Larry Bishop 's ( writer , director ) film , Underworld ( a dark crime flick ) , you will enjoy this one . His next outing ( writer , director , actor ) is Hell Ride with Michael Madsen and Quentin Tarantino .
neg	Before starting to watch the show , I 've heard it was great and aesthetically very interesting . What a deception , the scripts are so dumb that I am quite sure the authors are son and grandson of Scoobidoo writers . And what about the SFX and colors , they are so extreme that it is painful to watch , colors are not saturated they are over saturated , like scripts are overwritten and show is overrated . This show is like a bad pie in which a child would have put only sugar and butter thinking that because these ingredients are the best , they are sufficient . Unfortunately for this show , the only two ingredients of this show are finally vacuity and a total lack of credibility .
pos	Not sure one can call this an anti - war film , it shows war at an elite level . These are elite troops that know what they are doing and take great pride in it . Even when they are pacifist , they still enjoy the skill level and defeating their foes , even if it does go against being a pacifist . The movies is slow and rather uneventful and in many ways is rather tame as war movies go - more so by todays standards , no body parts flying off as in modern movies . It is brutal in other ways though as you see killing at a personal level . This is more of a thinking man 's movie . Once you start to watch you do n't want to miss anything . The thoughts of the men in the movie and their interactions , is what the movie is about- not the combat itself or a big exciting storyline . This maybe called a war triller . If you are into the skill of war , if you are into reading or seeing programs about the SAS and so on , YOU WANT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE ! ! ! ! ! Comparable movies are The Hill ( 1965 ) with Sean Connery , 49th Parallel ( 1941 ) with an all star cast , The Naked and the Dead ( 1958 ) with Cliff Robertson . All are unusual in their way and show war at a personal level . Enjoy !
neg	Complete waste of time .... This movie is not comedy , it 's not drama , it 's not romance ... not even teenage comedy at least ! ! ! Story ... it should be some turn - over one end ... but it 's so disappointing ! When movie has a turn - over on end I expect that turn - over to make movie even better ( exp . " Fight Club " ) but this turn - over makes movie even worse .... When I watch teenage comedy , and I do n't do that very often , I expect lousy jokes and bunch of nudeness ... Jokes are too lousy and there is no nudity ... You got only one .... very good looking I must admit ... girl , and that 's that ! And she 's fully dressed whole movie ! Acting is bad ... like soap series ... Do n't waste your time ! There are porns with better story and acting ! ( sorry on my bad English )
pos	Though the story is essentially routine , and the " surprise " ending is nothing but a bad joke on the audience , you can see what attracted these good actors to the project - it offers them the kind of roles in which good actors can shine , and shine they do . The film is impeccably made - for its time . It was remade in 2000 as " Under Suspicion " and if you only want to see one version of the story ( that 's all it deserves , really ) , I recommend the latter one , with Hopkins ' up - to - date direction and the more explicit references to plot points that the original could only hint at . The ending , however , still blows . ( * * 1/2 )
neg	Pathetic . This is what happens when director comes to work just because someone is paying him to .   The intentions were good , great locations and settings for a film of epic proportions . But the performance , damn ! I swear , in some shots you can see extras on the background staring in the camera , or looking at the actors because no one told them what they should do when they hear " Action ! " . The battle scenes are so bad you wonder - are these people for real ? They could 've done more damage just by hugging each other . In the slow - mo scenes you can see people on battle field walking around or just standing , waving their hands .   Only action in the foreground is somehow emphasized . But for what ? The story is so illogical and discontinuous , it seems like random situations in chronological order , sometimes not even that . The dialogs are dumb , the love plot is more embarrassing and ridiculous than in Hong Kong action movies .   With a budget of 40 million , and you can see every dollar invested on the screen , in best case scenario , the final result of all this enormous effort is a shiny round laser disk in the thin cover placed on the shelf in video store .
pos	Except for an awkward scene , this refreshing fairy tale fantasy has a fun and delightful undercurrent of adult cynical wit that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that powerfully moves this fairy epic along . Except for one of the Robert DeNiro scenes that does n't come across smooth and appears out of sync with the tone of the rest of the movie , this luscious romantic fairy tail has a great storytelling feel and the strong magic and the fine balance between serious adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual humor is well done . In the updated tradition of THE PRINCESS BRIDE this contemporary presentation of magic and love is captivating . Eight out of Ten Stars .
neg	I 've always been enthusiastic about period dramas , an art form in which the BBC has excelled in the past . This presentation of " Byron " was unbelievable . Unbelievably bad ! The script was dreadful , the acting uninspired , and all the characters woefully insipid . Apparently Byron was " mad bad and dangerous to know " , and set the ladies hearts all - a - flutter . Not in this production . Here he appeared as a tawdry jumped - up little squirt instead of a fiery hero of womenfolk and the Greek struggle for independence . It is said that Byron walked with a limp . This portrayal of the man was just limp all over . I watched the whole two and a half hours waiting for something to spark into life . Not a splutter , not even a glimmer . It was utter tedium , if not downright boredom , from start to finish . Having the opinion that no - one will ever better the Bard of Avon , I also believe that Byron 's poetry is over - revered and to my mind should be flung on the back burner , and this dramatisation of his life should be accorded the same treatment . I think the BBC lost its nous with this one
pos	Spoilers I loved the later episodes from college and on , but I wish I could get the last season on DVD . Unfortunately , the latest I could get is the first college season . Still the teenage years were sweet ; although they focused a lot on magic , they also made her into a character that teens could relate to , deeling with the stuggles of teens , and children in divorced families . This show was very innocent ; they did not get into the morbid teenage problems such as sex and drugs , but they did deel with pressure to fit in . I loved watching her grow up and cope with her magic on her own and trying to convince her Aunts to let go as she left the nest . The older episodes were cute , but it was just so much better to see her as ( well not really a teenage witch anymore ) but an adult witch . I loved Roxy and Mortgan ; they were so talented ! In the earlier episodes the Aunts were great actresses , but they were so strict , kind and loving , but they treated her like a young child in some ways , but not in every way . I mean they grounded her for every little mistake she made with her magic , I mean let her learn from her own mistakes for once ! That was what I liked about the college episodes ; she was able to learn from her own mistakes without be grounded over everything ; that was annoying . Not to put down Hilda and Zelda . Melissa Joan Hard is beautiful and was perfect for the Sabrina with her Perky personality . I liked the last episode where she ran off the marry Harvey , but as somebody else said , it would have been nice to see what happened after . I mean I believe it was obvious they were getting married ; where else would they be running off to in her wedding dress ? But I would have liked to have seen it . I supposed they wanted to leave it up to the viewer to choose the ending though rather than spoon feeding it to us as most comedies do . Somebody said they could have shown them marry and go to school in the house , but they already graduated college . Sabrina had great job for a magazine and I think Harvey had a good job , because he lived in a nice apartment that we only see at the end , but they never say what he does . As a child they always talk about how he does not want to be an exterminator like his Dad . When Sabrian moved into the house that season , they never really explain how it happened . Actually , there is a lot the show does not explain , but I supposed it is supposed to be to leave it up to us and give it some mystery . Prior to Sabrina and her friends moving into the house , they show Hilda getting married and this whole spell that ends up with Zelda turning into a child . Hilda comes back in the last episode ( and Zelda is there in some other form , but Beth is not on the episode ) but they do not show Zelda 's husband or what happened , like did they have children ? Maybe they did n't want too much going on in one episode . I also liked Hart 's sister who played her spoiled cousin ! She was pretty and a great actress and it was interesting to see her grown up ! I cannon believe it has been six years since the show went off the air ! I still love the reruns ! Also , I do n't know if anybody noticed this , but in the earlier episodes , the town was called Westbridbe ( a made up town I believe , which was supposed to be close to Salem ) but in the later episodes , they do n't mention the name of the town being caled Westbridge and I think they call it Boston , unless that is just where she worked . Also , I wanted to add , I found the episode , " Wild Wild Sabrina " where she is taught about the importance of rules , to be insulting . She was 18 and too old to be grounded ; I would have been insulted if my parents grounded me at 18 . And I think while an 18 year old might mess up how she did , they need to learn the consequences on their own . I think at 18 they know rules are important .
neg	This movie was based on actual fact ? I sincerely hope not ! We get to see what appears to be numerous armed cops empty an equal amount of guns at 2 guys who only got armored torso 's . That 's a great idea ; aim for the armor! ... excuse me , but how about those big fat unmissable heads or their legs for crying out loud . Or were there invisible tanks protecting them ? were they from Crypton?Did i miss something here ? This movie started out decent enough but after 20 minutes of shoot - out it really takes a turn to boringlane . And that documentary style did n't work for me either , but that s just something one finds likable or not . Highly unbelievable stuff which makes it hard to see it through ' til the end . 3/10 for the fine editing .
pos	When this movie first came out back in 1984 , Prince was one of the hottest acts around . Everyone wanted to see this movie , which was not much more than a extended music video . The acting was pretty bad , but what can you expect from musicians acting on the big screen for the first time ? Despite that , it was still a very entertaining film ! Morris Day and Jerome Benton provide some all time classic comedy , especially their rendition of " The Password " , which will make you think of Abbott & Costello doing their " who 's on first " baseball routine . Appolina ( who went by a single name then ) provided some beautiful breasts , so you had the brief nudity covered . Plus , she is very attractive . And of course , the soundtrack of the album is one of the best Prince ever recorded . Prince later on had a fallout with Warner Bros. and changed his name , but at this particular time in his career , he was at the top of his game . This movie does n't rank in the all time great category , but it is pretty entertaining .
neg	Spoiler below , but read on or you 'll never know the horrible fate that awaits all planing to rent " Rodentz " . On a moonlit night , in a remote research laboratory , a major medical breakthrough is about to have deadly results . A chemical compound that was created to " hunt and destroy " deadly cancer cells has leaked from the hazardous waste disposal system into the building 's basement . Now , the rodents involved in the laboratory experiment upstairs are not the only rats in the facility that will become the altered species . Professor Schultz , a leading bio - researcher , has just determined that the addition of a new enzyme now enables his " hunt and destroy " formulation to regenerate for the length of time necessary to neutralize deadly cancer tumors . When three varying degrees of the new mixture are administered to three different rats and the rest poured down the faulty " Waste Hazard " sink , shocking side - effects result in a night of terror ..... right ..... Seriously , this is probably the worst film I 've seen this year . Everything about it screams " Low - budget ! " , from the horrendous acting to the special effects which are some of the worst I 've ever seen . The characters are clichéd morons and act in stupid , predictable ways : walking down dark hallways alone , looking for a cat , tripping and falling so the " rats " can catch up with them , boarding themselves up in a small room , etc .   While some films are cheaply made , this film really takes the cake . Every possible corner is cut , everything from reusing earlier shots , filming the " Lab " hallways from different angles to make it look bigger ( That reminds me -- why were only TWO guys working in this freakin ' massive building ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ) , to music and special effects that could be done on a children 's workshop PC . That brings me to the worst aspect of this steaming pile of dung -- the special effects . Just horrendous . The computer generated rats look so fake and stand out in every scene so even the dumbest of film buffs could see they are computer generated . And that giant rat suit -- OH MY GOD ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! seriously , are we supposed to believe that freaking beany baby is a monster ? Just pitiful ........ On the better side , some of the gore looks pretty cool , especially considering the budget .   The actors all suck . no one involved with the production cared or knew what they were doing . I 've wasted enough time with review , just take my advice , it 's garbage . 1/10 . About the DVD : The transfer sucks , the audio is passable and there 's a commentary track on the disk by the director and two of his friends , who say they had absolutely nothing to do with making the film but were there to ask questions and make comments . All three of these sub - human primordial slime are so incredibly stupid that they should be institutionalized before they can harm themselves or others . I do n't want to waste any more of you kind reader 's time or mine , for I am starting to remember more than I want to about this film ..... DVD rating : 1/10 .
pos	When it first came out , this work by the Meysels brothers was much criticized and even judged to be exploitation . Luckily , it is now hailed as a masterpiece of documentary cinema , especially now that society has been exposed to real exploitation in what is reality television , and the bad evolution of most direct cinema . Really , at first , we must say that this is n't really direct cinema , it is more cinema verité . The difference between the two is very slight , but it mainly is the fact that in this documentary , we are made to feel the presence of the Meysels brothers , and they do interact with the characters filmed . This as well makes it clear that it is not exploitation . The Meysels have been allowed in the house , and they are included in what is a very eccentric situation of a very eccentric household . And both Edith and Edie just love the idea of being filmed . It would have been very disappointing had very been shown only a voice of God narration and shallow interviews . Here , we are given a full portrait of the madness of the house , a madness that does seem to go down well with both Edie and her mother Edith . Their house is a mess , litter and animals everywhere , faded colors and furniture all over the house , and the constant fights that are constant interactions of reality . These two people have lived with each other their whole life , and are not fighting in front of the camera because they want the attention , but rather because they ca n't help talking to each other this way . They know each other too well to hide their inner feelings , there is no need . In the end , though , even as they blame each other for their lives , they really love each other deeply . Edie says she does n't want her mother to die , because she loves her very much , and Edith says that she does n't want Edie to leave her because she does n't want to be alone . But the most interesting aspect of the film is that regardless of their old age , the two women ca n't help be girls . They can not help being one the singer , the other the dancer . Exhibit all their artistic skills in front of their camera . When Edie asks David Meysels rhetorically " Where have you been all my life ? " she is really very happy that she finally gets to show the whole world herself and her wonderful showgirls skills . A beautiful portrait of stylistic importance and a charm that is highly unlikely to be ever seen again , the way only the Meysels and few others could do .
neg	This is the worst sequel on the face of the world of movies . Once again it does n't make since . The killer still kills for fun . But this time he is killing people that are making a movie about what happened in the first movie . Which means that it is the stupidest movie ever . Do n't watch this . If you value the one precious hour during this movie then do n't watch it . You 'll want to ask the director and the person beside you what made him make it . Because it just does n't combine the original makes of horror , action , and crime . Do n't let your children watch this . Teenager , young child or young adult , this movie has that sorta impact upon people .
pos	Who ever came up with story is one sick person . I rented it for our slumber party sleepover and all six of us got freaked out cause we 're all in an acting class together , and we know a couple of the actors from class . Besides everybody screaming the whole freaky night , I had freaky nightmares . I kept thinking oh my God , if I get up to go to the bathroom to pee I 'm going to be stabbed in the middle of wiping or something . I could n't even go to the bathroom because we watched this gruesome horror movie . I also thought why are all the girls topless in this movie but we do n't any of the boys units ? You should make a horror film where the killer is a girl and chopping off units . I would watch that over and over . Call it hard or soft or something stupid like that . I 'm only giving this movie a 9 because you FREAKED ME OUT FREAKS .
neg	Though the title may suggest examples of the 10 commandments , it is a definitely incorrect assumption . This is an adaptation of 9 SEEMINGLY unrelated stories from Giovanni Bocaccio 's 14th century " Decameron " story collection . Set within a medieval Italian town 's largely peasant population , it is a diatribe on the reality of sex ( and its consequences ) within that world and time . A realistic view of Life within this world , it sometimes feels like a journey back in time . Given the depicted human element of its time , one can also see the more adventurous side of morality in its protagonists - as well as the ironies of Life , at times . Or it may also be viewed as a general satire of the Catholic Church 's rules . Nothing terribly special , but definitely interesting if one comes with no expectations or assumptions .
pos	I was n't expecting much , and , to be honest , I did n't like this film the first time around but watching it again and I realised that it 's kinda cool . Sure , it 's a one joke film but it 's a funny gag .   Someone posted that it could be better written and it could be . I think this film had the potential to be a over - the - top My Cousin Vinny . But with a horror host instead of a lawyer . Sadly it 's a wasted opportunity . With just a bit more writing it could be a classic . The kids are underused there 's no reason why they should latch on to Elvira . Apart from the obvious reasons . It would have been great to see their relationship flourish . I know it 's a comedy but it 's little differences that separate the good films from the brilliant . Elvira herself is always fun and engaging . Not to mention flirty . Every time she smiles you will too . It 's hard to knock a film when the main character is so charming . And it really is her charm , do n't let her looks fool you into thinking that she 's some sort of tart . Well she is . But she 's a nice one . The sort of person you 'd let look after your kids . Would n't let her cook for them , though ... I 'd recommend giving it a go .   Just do n't expect too much . She 's more than just a great set of boobs . She 's also an incredible pair of legs .
neg	This film is hardly good , not great at all . A few memorable scenes and the unlucky choice of pairing Norma Jean with an actual actress . Jane Russell has it all working for her , Marilyn 's lesser woman and/or actress . One can only wonder why this is considered being one of the highlights of her lame career . 3/10
pos	Whilst it is universally acknowledged that Fearful Symmetry was heavily influenced by the Kolchak episode They Have Been , They Are , They Will Be , whether this makes it a rip - off or a homage is an altogether more controversial point . As a huge fan of both series I subscribe to the latter belief , although the less charitable may not do . James Whitmore was brave to take on the task of directing such a difficult episode , invisible elephants and gorilla suits sounds like a recipe for disaster , but he pulls it off with style , the teaser being an absolute gem . Lance Guest does a great job of making a credible character out of Kyle Lang and Jack Rader seethes with menace as Ed Meecham . Forget Fearful Symmetry 's dubious originality and just enjoy it as a deeply satisfying X File .
neg	in fact , it 's basically the same movie.and they could n't even get the time line of events correct.maybe that was intentional due to laziness or not caring.either way , this thing is a real woofer.it does n't even deserved to be called a movie.i viewed this as a so called second feature on the disc containing the original The Boogeyman.i thought my head would explode , and i urge you to run as far in the opposite direction of this thing , if you should be cursed with the misfortune of combing across it 's path.it should come with a warning label like : Warning - may cause your i.q to drop several points if you are within it 's vicinity.for me , there 's no doubt this thing is a 0/10
pos	I liked this movie because it told a very interesting story about living in a totally different world at the south pole . Susan Sarandon is such a good actor , that she made an interesting , strong character out of mediocre writing . The true story displays a devastating situation for her character to overcome .
neg	This movie is about a cop ( Ching Wan Lau ) trying to catch a super - clever thief ( Ekin Cheng ) who blackmails an insurance company headed by a Kelly Lin . Basically , whatever plans the cop tries the thief somehow knows them beforehand . This movie , covered by handsome lead actors , beautiful lead actress and good camera shots of Hong Kong scenes , really has no substance at all . It 's all flash , and the flash quickly becomes dull too . I lost all interests a third of the way into the movie , and there is no redeeming quality after that , except for the cinematography , which looks good . Only consider seeing this movie if you can do so for free . Also , consider stopping watching the movie 20 minutes into the movie because it 's all the same to the end : BORING . 6/10
pos	I 've always knew Anne DeSalvo was a great character actor , now I know she is a great writer / director also . I have been a fan since I first saw her in the movies " Perfect " , " My Favorite Year " , " DC Cab " and " Stardust Memories " . It 's so rare to see Lee Grant these days in anything . She has been missing from the screen for far too long . It 's also wonderful to see Cloris Leachman in something other than a sit - com . This is her best work since " the Last Picture Show " . If you grew up in an Italian American family you will love this movie . I was n't expecting a lot when I started watching this movie , so I was pleasantly surprised when I fell in love with this movie . If you get the chance , watch it .
neg	I hate to sound like an ' old person ' , but frankly I have n't seen too many movies that I like that were made after 1960 ... generally , movies just seem to get worse and worse ( although I quite enjoyed the Scott Baio vehicle " The Bread , My Sweet " , except for the ' de rigeur ' sex scene which added NOTHING of value to THAT movie ) . This movie makes the mother , a former Las Vegas chorus girl , seem to be incapable of surviving on her own , although she is clearly in her 50s ( though hinted at being in her 40s ) . I did n't buy it . I 'm 57 and like all the women I know in their 50s and 40s , more than capable of surviving on my own ( as I have been doing since I graduated from high school at 13 , got legally emancipated and set off on my own life 's journey . )   The daughter is not believable in her job role ... she gets a promotion she does n't deserve ( a great opportunity ) and drops that ball too , but when another female employee steps up to the plate and is ready to deliver , the writers shoot her down as an ' opportunist ' , when she was just doing what any career - oriented person would do -- taking advantage of a wide - open opportunity created by the lack of self - discipline of her coworker , a girl who apparently does n't understand the concept of honoring her promises ( to her boss , in this case ) . The daughter grudgingly ' allows ' her mother to stay with her , on a temporary basis , but then treats her mother ( the woman who gave her Life and raised her to ' adulthood ' ) like a pariah . Apparently the ' writers ' of tripe like this do not understand that it is NOT ' the common thing ' for PARENTS to act like children , and then be treated AS children by THEIR children . That is just more of the societal ' baloney ' that Hollywood keeps trying to force down our throats as though we , their public , were stupid for desiring to be entertained by their creative offerings . This is a sad movie with a stupid ending . If the young male restauranteur had been real and not a two - dimensional ' tv character ' , he 'd have stayed with the MOTHER , who was not that much older than him and quite attractive . But in the end he ' falls ' for the daughter , a shallow , rather uninteresting girl who has that cuteness of youth , but in an ordinary , bland way . ( The ' opportunist ' young woman who worked with this nothing girl was far more attractive , physically . ) There was no believable reason presented to the audience as to why the restauranteur preferred the daughter ( who was an uptight , selfish , self - centered b*tch who treated her mother with unbelievable disrespect ) to the mother -- a woman who was kindhearted , sweet - tempered , humorous , and had a joie de vivre the daughter could not even begin to comprehend . Of course the mother had her own flaws ... she had reacted to her husband 's demise by drinking herself into a stupor for a year or two afterwards which supposedly created the rift between her and her smarmy daughter . Regardless of the way the characters were or were not developed , this is a baloney movie and a waste of your valuable viewing time unless you actually LIKE baloney . ( Where 's the mustard ? )
pos	What can be said of the compelling performance of Tara Fitzgerald ? She is utterly believable as the injured Mrs Graham , hardened by experience , sharp and strong - willed , yet not immune to the passionate attentions of Mr Markham . Through every mischievous glance and every flare of temper , every flicker of discernment in his eyes and telling facial expression , Toby Stephens is a master of his character . He is the force of passion and hope that will restore Helen 's injured spirit . Graves ' Huntingdon is a perfect performance of the unreformable rogue . Yet despite all he has done , there is an undeniable human dignity in his refusal to play the hypocrite at the end ; he is at least aware of his own failings and how they have brought his ruin . Helen 's attempt to save his soul-- after leaving him and taking their child at a time when this was unheard of -- is a triumph of hope , hope and faith in the worth of every human life and soul , however misguided , however sinful that person may be . Markham 's constancy may then be seen as her reward for her faith and unyielding moral character . Though the opinionated ideas of morality so strongly presented in Tenant seem outdated by today 's standards , the story is imbued with integrity , passion , and conviction which still make an impact . Tenant is far more believable than Wuthering Heights or even Jane Eyre ; here is an adaptation that does the novel justice . I highly recommend viewing it !
neg	Whenever a Columbo story deviates from the familiar plot ( colorful killer commits crime , Columbo smokes out killer , Columbo becomes a pest in the process ) , the writers somehow are never able to match the quality and interest of most traditional episodes . This episode deviates in the extreme , and the result is a major flop .   Would you believe : Columbo never faces the villain till the very end ? ! ! Frankly , I was tempted to turn it off about two - thirds through .   Oh , the sacrifices we self - appointed reviewers make ! ! !
pos	This film was an interesting take by Hollywood on the novel by of the same name by Pearl S. Buck . While some today might think it is rife with racial stereotypes , for the time the very idea of Chinese protagonists was progressive in and of itself . I found that the white actors playing Chinese was not as bad as I expected , that it was n't the Asian equivalent of blackface . Back then there were not really any Asian actors in America ( not even George Takei was acting ) and Rainer did a good job with her part . It was n't the greatest performance I have ever seen but for old - school pre - method acting it was nice . The locust scene was very well shot and contained convincing special effects . I wonder that the timing of the release during the Great Depression sort of turns this film into an allegory . Especially the political upheaval bewildering the peasant farmers and how them seem to be left behind by all of it . The film had some parallels to the John Ford style , but I think the Eastern influence affected it as well . If this had been an western family , the locusts would have won at the end , punishing the farmer for his pride , lust , and gluttony . However here he learns his lesson , then wins .
neg	The thing that really gets me about this movie ( that is , the thing about this movie that makes me physically ill ) is that someone actually paid to have it made . There is absolutely no purpose for the existence of this movie . It is not frightening , it is not thought provoking , it is not entertaining , it is not good . It is a sleeping pill made of cyanide . The DVD case compares it to Blair Witch , Evil Dead , and a few other decent movies , making the filmmaker 's desperation glaringly obvious . It is nothing like any other movie ever made ; it is far , far worse . The claims of an " extremely shocking ending you will never forget " are the equivalent of one ton of stinking horse droppings . Please do not ever waste your time watching this piece of trash , because it may make you sterile . The man who wrote this movie should be wiped off the Writer 's Guild membership list , and never allowed to film anything again . Because if he thought THIS was a movie worth making , he probably does not have much of anything to offer in the future . Zero stars . May Grod have mercy on the soul of anyone unfortunate enough to see this . I am going to go vomit now .
pos	I think this movie would be more enjoyable if everyone thought of it as a picture of colonial Africa in the 50 's and 60 's rather than as a story . Because there is no real story here . Just one vignette on top of another like little points of light that do n't mean much until you have enough to paint a picture . The first time I saw Chocolat I did n't really " get it " until having thought about it for a few days . Then I realized there were lots of things to " get " , including the end of colonialism which was but around the corner , just no plot . Anyway , it 's one of my all - time favorite movies . The scene at the airport with the brief shower and beautiful music was sheer poetry . If you like " exciting " movies , do n't watch this -- you'll be bored to tears . But , for some of you ... , you can thank me later for recommending it to you .
neg	This TV movie goes to show that bad films do exist . The only reason I saw this was it was covered on a KTMA MST3K. It 's Super Bowl at the Superdome in New Orleans . However , no football is played whatsoever and we see the behind the scenes look at basically nothing . With the many stars in this film , it made no difference . I really do n't know why I watched this .
pos	Life Begins - and ends - in a typical 1930 's maternity / recovery ward , where we view 48 hours in the lives of several high risk pregnant women , played by Loretta Young , Glenda Farrell , Clara Blandick ( Aunty Em ? ? ? ) , Vivienne Osborne , Dorothy Tree , and Gloria Shea , as they await to give birth . While the film features plot devices which seem far fetched today when maternity wards are much more controlled and restricted , it does offer us a look back in time to see what giving birth in a typical city hospital in 1932 was like for our grandmothers and great - grandmothers . I found the film fascinating and exceptionally moving . Oddly enough , the most outstanding performance in this film comes from a male cast member , young Eric Linden as Jed Sutton , Grace 's ( Loretta Young ) husband . What an actor ! As a first time father , Jed is distraught and uneasy with hospital staff who seem to brush off his concerns about his wife as they might brush crumbs off a cafeteria table . I felt his every concern keenly . I 'd like to see more of this actor 's work . He had a very emotional voice , which was used to unforgettable effect in Gone With The Wind . In that film Eric played the young soldier whose leg was amputated without anesthesia , who screamed " Do n't cut ! Do n't cut ! " as Scarlett fled the hospital in horror . Chilling ! Another great performance is from Aline MacMahon , who plays Miss Bowers , the nurse . Her character is a salt of the earth type , the kind of nurse we all hope to get for our hospital stays , who breaks the hospital rules constantly in order to show a more humane side of the medical profession . Loretta Young did another superb acting job here as well , a very authentic and deeply felt performance as Grace . My , she is great in these precodes , I 've really grown to appreciate her more as an actress the last few months . Glenda Farrell played her role of a shrill unwed mother a little over the top for my taste ( did n't anyone know back in 1932 that swigging brandy from a hot water bottle might be hazardous to unborn babies ' health ? ) but her character redeems herself in the end . Also in the cast was an uncredited Gilbert Roland , silent movie star , as a grieving Italian husband . His screen time was brief , but notable . Life Begins is a must - see precode , try to catch it sometime on TCM , but remember to bring a few hankies to cry into . 9 out of 10 .
neg	If you hit your head with a shovel , write the script with your feet , you may come close to the intelligence level of this movie . There is nothing in this movie that has n't been done a thousand times in other gangster flicks and done much better . Those who think " Scarface " was some kind of hero to be looked up to or saw " Goodfellas " , " Menace II Society " or " Dead Presidents " and thought MMM " That 's the life for me ! " will like this movie . I thought I 'd give the movie a chance , since the premise was perfect for a prequel . I should have known better after seeing Mario Van Peebles and Sean Combs were involved . Anyone above a 4th grade education , see the original with Pacino , a real actor , and be satisfied .
pos	Hey now , I ca n't claim to have seen all of the films of Jesse ( Jesus ) Franco , and there sure seem to be a lot of them , but this is one of the better ( and weirder ) of the lot that I have seen . I 'd say most likely he was in his prime back in the late sixties / early seventies and anything lately has been a bit TOO strange for me , and it takes a lot for me to declare that . Anyway , this is like one big bad dream where parts of it seem to come true at various points . This woman is an actress or something , performs in some theater in Berlin where acts of " fake " torture are performed for an appreciative audience ( ? ! ) and she seems to have this problem with dreaming . The catch to what 's real and what 's not in this movie is apparently the real stuff is in sharp focus and the dream stuff is n't . She seems to exist in a state of deja vu . I wo n't say this makes a whole lot of sense but it is pretty wild and weird and entertaining . Shots of Berlin make it seem like a lonely and creepy place , so that adds to the atmosphere . The ending is extremely abrupt though , the film just ends and the tape went black , I guess no need to let you know it was over at that point . My copy was from the Anchor Bay Euro - Trash collection , and I say , give me more Euro - Trash , I ca n't get enough of that crap . But it 's GOOD crap .
neg	It is only Robert De Niro film which I really hates . It is stupid film with horrible acting ( of course not De Niro ) . For me , Brian De Palma must do his mafia films as always like Scarface ( 1983 ) or The Untouchables ( 1987 ) . I also loved De Palma 's Mission : Impossible ( 1996 ) . De Niro worked with Palma two different times too , Greetings and The Wedding Party . I though that The Wedding Party was OK too ( I did n't watch Greetings ) .   Screenplay is really bad and unfunny . There are no any scene where I can smile for even one time . Film lost a chance to be a funny style even a little bit in a " Be Black baby " scene and also I do n't like the scene where a guy 's sexual organ appeared . So , it is one of the worst film I have ever seen ! just worst . I hate that .
pos	" My child , my sister , dream   How sweet all things would seem   Were we in that kind land to live together ,   And there love slow and long ,   There love and die among   Those scenes that image you , that sumptuous weather . " Charles Baudelaire   Based on the novel by Elizabeth Von Arnim , " Enachanted April " can be described in one sentence  it takes place in the early 1920s when four London women , four strangers decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April . It is the correct description but it will not prepare you for the fact that " Enchanted April " - an ultimate " feel good " movie is perfection of its genre . Lovely and sunny , tender and peaceful , kind and magical , it is like a ray of sun on your face during springtime when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of serene happiness and cherish it forever . This is the movie that actually affected my life . I watched it during the difficult times when I was lost , unhappy and very lonely , when I had to deal with the sad and tragic events and to come to terms with some unflattering truth about myself . It helped me to regain my optimism and hope that anything could be changed and anything is possible . I had promised to myself then that no matter what , I would pull myself out of misery and self - pity and I would appreciate every minute of life - with its joy and its sadness ... I promised myself that I would go to Italy and later that year I did and I was not alone . Charming , enchanting , and heartwarming , " Enchanted April " is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love . This little film is a diamond of highest quality .
neg	My boyfriend and I rented this because we thought it might be a good ' Halloween ' take - off . A killer terrorizing young people , a white mask ... you get my drift . We were dead wrong ! No pun intended . We not only discovered one of the worst movies out there , but also that it is a cult classic ! It is filled w / plot holes and makes no sense . The actress who plays Maddy is pretty , but that 's about it . I do give credit for it being shot on a VERY low budget -- I always support movies like that . Just not this particular one . This movie may be good to see if you 're drunk or high ; otherwise do n't bother . Unless you want to lose your movie privileges like I did !
pos	The Human Tornado is a campy 70 's Blaxploitation movie starring nightclub comedian Rudy Ray Moore in perhaps his most endearing role to date . The movie tells the tale of Dolemite , a bad ass pimpin ' hustler who gets on the wrong side of a white , racist sheriff by sleeping with his wife . Dolemite barely escapes , and journeys to sunny California to visit an old friend , a nightclub owner ( and Madam to Dolemite 's ' ladies ' ) named Queen Bee . However , it seems that a rival nightclub owner with Mob connections is trying to muscle in on her racket , so Dolemite takes matters into his own hands . Rudy Ray Moore showcases many diverse talents in this landmark film , including strong dramatic skills , a mastery of Kung Fu , an impressive singing voice ( he provides two of the songs on the soundtrack ) , a touching , compassionate side with the ladies , and an overall compelling charisma and keen sense of comic timing . This film has it all , people : A deep plot , blistering action , laugh - a - minute comedy , beautiful women in distress , a slam - bang ending ... what more could you ask from a movie ? Run , do n't walk , to your local video store and rent The Human Tornado today . And be sure to share it with your family .
neg	Despite some mildly thought - provoking oddities in the script and the film 's overall curiosity value , Fury of the Wolfman emerges as a dull , uninteresting excursion into lycanthropy , saved only by the statuesque presence of villainess Perla Cristal . The rest of the players , including the hammy Naschy , are a complete write - off ( though admittedly none are helped by often atrocious dubbing ) . Although the screenplay packs in enough variations on werewolf / Frankenstein / Dr Moreau themes to flesh out a dozen movies , the plot is so unevenly developed , the characterizations so feeble and the dialogue so verbosely ridiculous ( at least in the English version ) , that any latent interest in the turgid proceedings is soon quashed . Zabalza 's direction seems jerky , even amateurish . His staging is clumsy and ineffective . He is not helped by Villasenor 's over - bright lighting . Even promising sets are so unatmospherically photographed that the director 's few attempts to give the audience a fright are signaled far in advance Other credits fall into a similar pattern of ineptitude , though the stridently over - emphatic music score and the laughably crude , totally primitive special effects deserve special condemnation .
pos	I saw this movie once as a kid on the late - late show and fell in love with it . It took 30 + years , but I recently did find it on DVD - it was n't cheap , either - in a catalog that specialized in war movies . We watched it last night for the first time . The audio was good , however it was grainy and had the trailers between reels . Even so , it was better than I remembered it . I was also impressed at how true it was to the play . The catalog is around here someplace . If you 're sincere in finding it , fire me a missive and I 'll see if I can get you the info . cartwrightbride@yahoo.com
neg	Sky Captain is possibly the best awful movie I 've seen in a long while . Rife with amazing CG and special effects , studded with an A - list cast ( Jude Law , Gwyneth Paltrow , Angelina Jolie and the infinitely likable Giovanni Ribisi ) and racing along with an overused but Indiana Jones - esquire storyline , this should have been a great movie to watch . ' Should have ' being the key term here , of course . Jude Law plays Joe the Sky Captain with a dashing accent and plenty of over - the - shoulder , heart - melting smirks , but you ca n't make something out of nothing , and even his flippant deliveries and boyish good looks ca n't save the movie 's stone dialogue . ( If he had slapped Giovanni Ribisi on the back and said , " Good boy , Dex , " just ONE more time , I might have barfed all over the guy in front of me . ) Gwyneth Paltrow , as Polly Perkins , is nothing less than nerve grating . Her nasal whining and not - quite - sarcastic comments get old in the first ten minutes of the movie . Perhaps she put too much effort into playing the stereotypical 30 's comic book heroine- who knows ? I expected more from her . An example of how a similar character was played ( and played well ) is in the late 90 's flick " The Phantom , " starring Kristy Swanson and Billy Zane . Rent the movie and you 'll know what I mean . Giovanni Ribisi and Angelina Jolie were the saving graces in the film . ( Angelina Jolie was incredibly hot in that eyepatch . I 'll admit it . ) In just a few short scenes , both actors somehow managed to rise above the tired material and deliver a more riveting performance than their dry , two - dimensional castmates . The plot and steady story progression were old , boring , and basically just a monotonous combination of every good scene from an action movie in the past thirty years . The pace is rapid - fire in the first half of the movie , and a snail 's pace in the second , giving the audience enough time not only to guess the eventual conclusion of the film , but to figure out who the key villain is as well . The pairing is rather clichéd , also- Polly Perkins and Sky Captain apparently reunite after several years of separation from a bitterly - ended romance , and their story is n't so much charming and eclectic as it is annoying and mismatched . When they finally come to terms with their mutual feelings towards the end of the film , nobody 's surprised , and nobody really cares either . Props to the director for appreciating Bai Ling enough to dress her in skintight vinyl for the entirety of the film , and also for the intriguing sepia tones that served as coloration throughout . But Sky Captain , despite having all the essential elements of being a great movie , falls flat on its face . Not even worth the $ 2.75 I paid to get into the theater .
pos	This is a great movie ! Most of us have seen Jurassic Park , where the Chaos Theory is summarized by telling about a butterfly 's wings , causing a tornado on the other side of the planet . Well , Bug is all about that ( or at least something , do n't worry this is no spoiler ) I 'm definitely not a religious type and do n't believe in pre - destined stuff , fate , etc , but this movie surely makes you wonder if coincidence really exists ... further more , the acting and camera are excellent too , another prove that it 's still possible to make a good movie without a zillion bucks
neg	  The movie " Slugs " is unique because the titular vermin are actually the good guys in this horrific tale of nature gone awry . You see , these poor slugs have been mutated through the pollution of evil humans and do n't mean to do anything malicious , they 're just slugs- slugs with sharp teeth who eat flesh and excrete poison , but slugs none the less . The real bad guys are the humans , who either actively try to destroy our beloved slugs , or overreact when they encounter them . For example , take the scene where the guy puts on the glove full of slugs . They were just hanging out in a comfortable work glove when out of nowhere this giant hand came at them , and they reacted instinctively , defending themselves and biting the guy . Now , instead of seeking medical attention for his slug bite , this guy runs around his greenhouse screaming like an idiot , spills some highly volatile chemicals , starts a fire , knocks a bookcase over on himself , and cuts off his own hand- then the fire and volatile chemicals mix and his house explodes . How can you blame that on the slugs ? This movie paints a portrait of humans that is less than favorable . The characters in this movie include the dumb sheriff who hates everybody , the drunk hick who 's mean to his dog , and the lumpy sidekick whose wife is at least forty - five years older than him . There 's also a set of drunken teens that get attacked while copulating , and we have to see the skinny long - haired freaks ' genitals . Meanwhile , there 's a guy who looks like a demonic Leslie Neilson who yells " You do n't have the authority to declare happy birthday ! " for some reason . Finally , this parade of loathsomeness is rounded out by the guy from the MST3 K classic " Pod People " whose face explodes after eating a slug - laces salad ( another easily avoided fate blamed on the helpful , harmless slugs ) . Humans are portrayed as greedy , stupid , racist , alcoholic , and , in one pointless scene , as would - be rapists . In the movie 's climactic scene , the villainous humans try to burn the slugs who are cowering helplessly in the sewers , Well , since they 're idiots , the humans succeed in BLOWING UP THE ENTIRE TOWN . They alone do more damage than the slugs ever did ! If you hate humans , and I know I do , you 'll appreciate " Slugs " . If you 're a fan of bad cinema , you 'll also appreciate this crapfest from the director of " Pieces " and " Pod People " . There 's enough bad acting , silly dialog , illogical plot twists , lame special effects , pointless scenes , and poor dubbing to hold your attention .
pos	This movie is definitely on the list of my top 10 favorites . The voices for the animals are wonderful . Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both brilliant as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch , but the real standout is Don Ameche as the old , faithful golden retriever . This movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children as well as adults . Humorous and suspenseful , and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry ! ( happy tears ! )
neg	We 've all been there , sitting with some friends watching a bad movie , laughing at how terribly it was made and how poor the acting was ; eventually the credits roll and everyone looks around and says " how is it possible such a movie was made ? who paid money to have this script made into a feature film ? " Well Jigsaw is not that kind of film , instead of asking how this garbage was budgeted you wonder why the makers were shot out of a cannon into the sun . Yes , Jigsaw is quite possibly the worst movie ever made or conceived , this coming from a guy who has seen Campfire Stories and Fever Lake . The film starts out in some kind of college class , what kind of class I am unsure , but it is imagined to be an art class . Now these dorks have been given a final project by their idiot teacher , five of them are given pieces of a mannequin and told to design it in any way they see fit , and since there are only five pieces the other students in the class receive and automatic A , oddly enough there are only six students in this entire class so the one goth chic gets a free A , good for her ! A week passes and the five students , plus teacher , plus one hillbilly husband meet in a bar to discuss their and complete their project , they put the pieces together , head , arms , legs and inform the others why they chose their specifics designs , now these creative geniuses used the week to their full advantage , one puts a saw blade in the left hand , the other gets a sawed off shotgun , the right leg gets a bunch of broken ceramic glued to it and the left some magazine clippings , the head is the worst getting a camera in the eye , ala Hellraiser 3 , with some bottle rockets for a stylish mo - hawk . After they have all spilled their guts about their specifics designs the now drunk teacher says they are to burn the mannequin , now aptly named Jigsaw . Now up to this point it has been standard horrible movie fair , bad acting , dialog and everything else , but has still been pretty plausible , yet after Jigsaw catches fire things take a turn for the worst ... Jigsaw comes alive .. How you ask ? I have no idea , he just does because the writers could n't think of a realistic way for two pounds worth of molded plastic to become alive ( Come on guys , a bolt of lighting , a traveling voodoo priest , anything could have worked . ) So once Jigsaw comes to life he uses his new abilities of walking very slow and stilted with the use of his molded fingers to wreak havoc . First he kills the cool guy with some barb wire , this guy who was about to get it on with a hot chic decides drinking ground beer off in the distance is more important than what is in front of him . With him gone Jigsaw shoots the sexy girl in the face and then gives an old man a heart attack with a slight twist of his head , he then saws up a nasty looking southern woman and then her hillbilly husband ; Jigsaw then kills the nerdy guy with some headless deception . Did I mention Jigsaw was taking body parts off his victims to make a human version of himself ? No ! Well its not important they do n't even show his macabre creation , they do n't even show him steal away a torso from his poor creators ( Maybe he was trying to create the head detective from In Living Color ) . So after these five have been killed the teacher and the nerdy girl are all who is left , the teacher figures out that Jigsaw only needs a head to finish his masterpiece , since he is still uninterested in that torso thing . So being the coward he is the teacher ties up the girl as a sacrifice to Jigsaw who comes in only to go for the teacher with his electric buzz saw which is n't even plugged in . That is where the freaking movie ends , we do n't even get to see the teacher get killed or what happens to the girl , let alone an explanation why Jigsaw came to life or how he cleaned himself off after being burned . This movie is so shameful it has too be seen , it is only 71 minutes so it is a small part of your day ; For the memories of a lifetime , Jigsaw , Jigsaw , Jigsaw . Thank you Total Recall ! The Judge has ruled , watch Jigsaw only if your plans of severing off your genitals seems played out .
pos	Gung Ho is one of those movies that I never get tired of watching . Michael Keaton has always been a favorite of mine , & he is absolutely hilarious in this movie . Matching him step for step is Gedde Watanabe . The two of them work wonderfully together . Although this movie is a comedy , I also like how it shows Hunt ( Keaton ) & Kazihiro ( Watanabe ) struggling in their roles as the leaders of their respective groups . They both try so hard to keep the peace , & then they finally get into a fight ( which is hysterical to watch ) . First , they 're both on the floor . Then Hunt jumps on a chair . Kazihiro jumps on the desk . Hunt jumps on the desk with him . The fight then spills out from the office into the factory . I love that after they are separated by the workers , you can tell that they both feel bad for letting things get so out of hand . Also , there is a scene where you can see the influence that Hunt has had on Kazihiro . He is at his house & his boss from Japan arrives & says he would like to visit the factory tomorrow :   Kazihiro : Tomorrow not good day . Sakamoto : Why not ? Kazihiro : Factory is locked & we ca n't find key . Tell me you ca n't picture Michael Keaton saying something like that ! I guess I really like this movie because it is genuinely funny , & also shows how people that are radically different can not only learn from each other , but become good friends as well .
neg	This version is pretty insipid , I 'm afraid . Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood , but William Hurt 's weary , throwaway acting style is completely unsuitable to the bold passion of Edward Rochester and poor Charlotte Gainsbrough looks like a bored , petulant teenager whose dental braces hurt ! I also ca n't believe that they eliminated Edward 's great marriage proposal scene from the end of the book , one of the most moving moments in literature . I do appreciate that they finally used such a young , plain woman to play Jane , a character who is supposed to be a worldly 18 , but if you want to see a version that closer approximates the personalities and passions of the novel , please see the 70 's version with George C. Scott and Susannah York . York was too old , tall and pretty to play Jane , but no one has touched Rochester 's character the way that Scott did .
pos	This is a neat little crime drama which packs a lot into its 65 minute running time . It has all the right ingredients - a mystery corpse , a weary middle - aged cop Corrigan ( Walter Kinsella ) and his rookie sidekick Tobin ( John Miles ) , a shadowy killer on the loose and even love interest for the Tobin in the shape of a female botanist Mary ( Patricia Wright ) who helps solve the crime . There 's also a terrific shoot - out finale which takes place in a stone cutters yard . Watch out for a terrific goof near the start of this movie where Lt . Corrigan refers to the dead woman as ' Tatooed Tilly ' BEFORE the coroner reveals that she had a tattoo ( confusing huh ? ) . Also later when Tobin is chasing the killer across the back yards he is suddenly shown going in the wrong direction at one point - no wonder he did n't catch him !
neg	The filming crew did not have good access to the occupied territories , so filming of the Israeli side dominated . I was struck by the nearly completely opposite points of view of the mothers . The Israeli mother lost a child who had the possibility of a life of tremendous happiness . The Palestinian mother lost a child who had only the possibility of a life of privation and despair . With such completely different viewpoints , any meeting had no real chance of any meeting of the minds . The word " peace " did not have the same meaning to each of them . Peace to the Palestinian was freedom . Peace to the Israeli was security . With such an abyss , is this sort of film really worth much ? I finished with the feeling that I had watched pointless propaganda -- both sides were unconvincing .
pos	Peaceful rancher Robert Sterling is on the losing side of a range war with his ruthless neighbors , that is until notorious outlaw Robert Preston shows up out of the blue to level the playing field . Soon he begins to go too far , feeding a growing sense of unease in Sterling , especially when his son begins to idolize the wily criminal . The Sundowners is a tightly - paced , gritty , and surprisingly tough little picture with a great performance by Preston . Here , he comes across as an evil version of Shane , that is until the real nature of the rancher and the outlaw 's relationship is revealed . Most movie guides and video boxes spoil the surprise ! Rounding out the cast is Chill Wills , Jack Elam , and the debut of John Drew Barrymore , who became more famous for his offspring than his acting .
neg	This movie was awful . I had a very difficult time watching this all the way through . I did n't get the point of the movie . What was the point of this movie ? The soundtrack was bad , acting was bad and the story uninspiring . The two main characters in the movie were very boring and their dialog was uninteresting . There was no chemistry among any of the cast members . I do n't know this for a fact , but I suspect that most of the actors were first timers . The movie could have easily been cut down to about an hour and half without losing the plot . That indicates how many useless scenes there were in the movie . I would have rather ha a root canal during the two hours of the movie . I want those two hours back ! If you want to watch good , funny movie that is family friendly and made by a bunch of mormons , watch Napoleon Dynamite instead .
pos	ZP is deeply related to that youth dream represented by the hippie movement . The college debate in the beginning of the movie states the cultural situation that gives birth to that movement . The explosion that Daria imagines , represents the fall of all social structures and therefore the development of all that huge transformation that society is suffering through and finally Mark 's death anticipates the end that A sees for the movement itself . The film will be more easily understood if we go back to that time in life . During the 60 ' and 70 ' , young people were the driving force for the profound explorations for change . One of the more significant changes intended was to bring sexuality out of the closet , and i think the scenes in the desert do not represent an orgy but the sexual relationship that men and women in absolute freedom would perform in the hipotetic situation where there would be nobody to hide from . I watched the scene where the couples would throw sand to each other and appreciated the magnificent way in which A depicted the impossibility to continue hiding this basic human instinct . Repression was the way to ' control ' social outbursts at that time and that is the method , police applies to stop the students . This society suffers from hipocresy , and that comes clear when the students gain access to weapons skipping all fake controls . The dialogue between the policeman with the college professor , who 's detained for no reason shows part of society interested for this youth feeling and part completely uninterested . Presenting flying as the more accurate symbol for freedom , the stealing of the plane represents Mark 's inner wish for it but , his ( going back or coming back or returning ( segun ) ) shows the difficulties to come free from these bonds and as i ' ve said , A depicts the death of the dream by these difficulties winning the game . In my point of view a film to remember .
neg	' Metamoprhis ' is the story of a dashing young scientist , revered at the local college , is brought under investigation by financial providers for the college . This forces him to take shortcuts in typical bad - Hollywood melodramatic fashion . My first thought after this movies conclusion was this . " Not good , but not bad , for early - to - mid eighties . " Of course , I then realized that it was made in 1990 , which almost propelled it down to a ' 4 ' , but decided to keep it at the mediocre ' 5 ' that it is . ' Metamorphis ' does on a few occasions , seem like a good movie desperately trying to get out . The acting , while not stellar , is mostly competent . You can even see the occasional glisten of a modest quality . Pacing is a large problem with the movie . After thinking I had been watching for ninety minutes , I realized I 'd only been watching an hour . Special effects are n't stellar , but the director seems to be mostly competent enough to work around that weakness . The lead , a mildly charismatic male that seems to be attempting a blended channeling of Tom Cruise and Christopher Reeves , reminded me mostly of Matt Dillon 's character in ' Wild Things ' . The female heroine does an OK job , but does not distinguish herself in anyway . There 's a ' naughty girl ' role in here , and the actress does what she can with it , but it does n't seem like much . There is a child actor that the director ca n't decide if he 's morose , cheerful or just weird .   Pacing , as I said , is the worst problem with this movie , until a final battle with the bad guy that would make a Power Ranger blush . It is bizarre and inexplicable , until the final scene which is supposed to be dramatic but simply hilarious , saturated with every bad camera trick and overacting that can be compressed in about thirty seconds . A decent one - time watch on the ' Mill Creek 50 Chilling Movie Pack ' . Nothing that is going to bring you back , and nothing to buy on its own .
pos	  Robot jox is a great little film ok some of the sets are bad and the acting is not that great but the special effects are very good for a film of this size and age . You have to remember that this film is over 10 years old now and was made very cheaply in the 1st place so you ca nt moan to much about the bad parts . So just sit back and watch a cool film with great big robots in it .
neg	Feature of early 21 century cinema of lets pit different evil creatures and bad guys against each other . We have n't seen stuff like this since Godzilla v King Kong and the like . Always sounds great on paper when you 're splicing up and in a haze of the good stuff you have an inspired idea and see the whole playing out before you like Beethoven 's symphonies . Then you come to writing it . Great ideas like all vampires are female . Ergo hot , seductive deadly but in a way I want to perish sort of way . And all zombies are men . well that s what men are like to a woman just after she s been dumped or cheated on right ? So it all looks good up to actually making it . Then the rot starts to set in . Mosters have fight . Nothing much happens . Another fight . Philosophical noodling and cods wallop . Eureka we 've found how to win . Big fight again and the End . Sounds great does n't it ? If it was made an indie company it would be great . But this is Hollywood with the eye on the bucks : gloss instead of what the fans want . It all could have been gore soaked beautiful .
pos	There are very few performers today who can keep me captivated throughout an entire film just by their presence . One of those few is Judy Davis , who has built a successful career out of creating characters that are headstrong in attitude but very vulnerable at heart . She takes roles that most other performers would treat melodramatically and adds a fiery , deeply emotional intensity that pulls attention away from everything else on the screen . Her skills are well displayed in " High Tide , " a film that matches her up a second time with director Gillian Armstrong , who gave Davis her first major success with " My Brilliant Career . " In that film , Davis played a young woman who was determined to make it in the world , despite the suffocation she felt from her community and upbringing . In " High Tide , " however , Davis ' character , Lillie , is roughly the opposite : she gave up on any hope for her future when she was young , and , after giving birth to a child , runs from her responsibilities and takes up a life without direction or meaning . When she finally meets up with her daughter years later , the thought of taking care of her child is petrifying ; she knows this is her chance to atone for her failures , but how can she be honest with her daughter and still gain her respect ? Gillian Armstrong 's films usually relate stories about characters who desperately want to communicate with each other , but face obstacles set up by their own personal habits and addictions . " Oscar and Lucinda , " for instance , was about a man and a woman who desperately needed each other 's love but were always blindsided by their craving for chance , represented by their gambling addictions . Here , we are immersed in the world of a family torn apart by the mother 's inability to commit to a settled life and her struggles to redeem herself despite being fully convinced that it 's too late to change for the better . This is not simply a film with a great performance at its center , but also a rare achievement : a fully convincing story of redemption .
neg	The premise sucked me in , but it was clear about 30 seconds in that this was either David Lynch or something seriously terrible . Interesting to watch just to run through the fundamentalist laundry list . I can be a sucker for a stirring spiritual piece ( Romero comes to mind ) , but there was nothing spiritual whatsoever about this one . The message seems to be that we must all pretend we have an iq of 80 ( or simply get a lobotomy - Jennifer what happened to ya ? ) and blindly follow the Bible without any sort of self - examination whatsoever or we 'll trigger the second coming . It 's the kind of attitude that makes people fly jumbo jets into 110 story buildings ( I work around the corner from the site of the former WTC ) . I like to think that God is a little greater than that .
pos	I swear , that zombie was killed like twice , and kept coming back . I gave this movie an 8 . Let 's face it folks , this is exactly what the other reviewers are saying , i.e. , a " handy - cam " , shot film . Hey , hey , hey , welcome to total indy film making . The fact that Todd Sheets got over 700 zombies to appear in this movie is a tribute to his talents . Yes , the story has gaps , yes , we see the same zombies over and over again , but who really cares ? Take it for what it is , a fun and gory horror film , one to share with your buds , or to gross out the people you really care about LOL . Mellow out people , I suppose you all liked hunks of garbage like " Titanic " or " Twister " instead . Peace , and support independent film making ! ! !
neg	The number of goofs in this episode was higher than the first 9 . They do n't follow their own rules about spirits where destruction of the body makes the spirit dissolve . This one dropped a second body . That body , and Dean , drop about 20 feet from Sam but then they are right with Sam . Flashlights go out in an unlighted asylum , at night , and we can still see everything . It 's night but light is streaming through the windows . A ghost that died in 1960 's is making cell phones calls ? Come on ! There is no way Sam could get a psychiatrist to see him in the same day he makes an appointment and the doctor talks to Sam like it was n't his first visit . Sam and Dean knew there were other bodies in the asylum and innocent spirits still lurking and did n't do anything to help them . That does n't seem like a thing the Winchester boys would do . Oh and after crawling around on a dirt filled mattress and all around a nasty asylum the girls ' makeup and hair is perfect and not a smudge on her white shirt .   While the implementation of this episode had problems the premise was good and a few times I was not creeped out but nervous as Dean sat reading Elicots ' journal . I just knew that an object so intensely personal to the ghost would draw it to the person violating it 's sanctity . Elicot did n't appear . Maybe that is a fault for such an important object or place ( like Elicot 's office ) should draw the spirit when a living being touches or enters . When they separate I want to scream ... ' that 's how you die ! Always stay together and watch each others backs ! ' but they do n't listen to me :o The Elicot spirit and his special ability was a very nice touch . It 's prime - time show but I do wish the horror of Elicot strapping one of his victims down and using anticipation of torture to creep us out further . Especially because of the lighting goofs I gave this a 4 . Sudden darkness or the flickering of the whole scene 's lighting as the flashlight flickers is all that more terrifying . The lighter coming or the flashlight reviving and instantly a spirit is in their face is shocking . I understand the directors wants us to see his scene but then make a mention or obvious connection by Elicot touching an electric socket and the lights coming on . Have the characters respond to the fact an asylum with no power suddenly has lights in the one room . Blue white lights flickering as electric arcs just like Elicot 's finger power .   Seriously , MCG could have done better .
pos	I was lucky enough to catch this film finally on Turner Classic films tonight , as it is one of the films that won an Oscar ( for special effects ) in their yearly month of Oscar winning films .   BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS is easily a sequel film for the earlier success of MARY POPPINS . That film too was a big success , and an Oscar winner ( Best Actress for Julie Andrews ) . Like MARY POPPINS BEDKNOBS has David Tomlinson in it , in a role wherein he learns about parenting . It is a fine mixture of live action and animation . It is set in a past period of British history ( if not the Edwardian - Georgian world of 1912 London , it is England 's coastline during the " Dunkirk " Summer of 1940 ) . It even has old Reginald Owen in it , here as a General in the Home Guard , whereas formerly he was Admiral Boom in MARY POPPINS . Ironically it was Owen 's final role . The Home Guard sequences ( not too many in the film ) reminds one of the British series DAD 'S ARMY , dealing with the problems of the local home guard in the early years of the war . The period is also well suggested by the appearance of the three Rawlins children as war orphans from the bombings in the Blitz in London . And ( in typical Disney fashion ) in the musical number " Portobello Road " different members of the British Army ( including soldiers from India and the Caribbean ( complete with metal drums yet ! ) ) appear with Scottish and local female auxiliaries in costume . All of which , surprisingly , is a plus . But the biggest plus is that for Angela Lansbury , her performance as Eglantine Price is finally it : her sole real musical film lead . In a noteworthy acting career , Lansbury never got the real career musical role she deserved as Auntie Mame in the musical MAME that came out shortly after BEDKNOBS did . She had been in singing parts ( in GASLIGHT with her brief UP IN A BALLOON BOYS , and in THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY with LITTLE YELLOW BIRD , and - best of all - in support and in conclusion of THE HARVEY GIRLS with the final reprise of ON THE ATCHISON , TOPEKA , AND THE SANTA FE ) . But only here does she play the female lead . So when you hear her singing with David Tomlinson you may be able to understand what we lost when she did not play Mame Dennis Burnside . The rest of the cast is pretty good , Tomlinson here learning that he can rise to the occasion after a lifetime of relative failure . The three children ( Cindy O'Callaghan , Roy Snart , and Ian Weighill ) actually showing more interesting sides in their characters than their Edwardian predecessors in POPPINS ( Weighill in particular , as something of a budding opportunist thinking of blackmailing Lansbury after finding out she is a witch ) . The only surprising waste ( possibly due to cutting of scenes ) is Roddy McDowall as the local vicar who is only in two sequences of the film . With his possible role as a disapproving foe of witchcraft he should have had a bigger part . Also of note is John Ericson , as the German officer who leads a raid at the conclusion of the film , only to find that he is facing something more powerful than he ever imagined in the British countryside , and Sam Jaffe as a competitor for the magic formula that Lansbury and Tomlinson are seeking .   As for the animation , the two sequences under the sea in a lagoon , and at the wildest soccer match ever drawn are well worth the view , with Tomlinson pulled into the latter as the referee , and getting pretty badly banged up in various charges and scrimmages . As I said it is a pretty fine sample of the Disney studio 's best work .
neg	Terrible film made on a budget of about $ 9.99 . Very obvious miniature sets used , poor acting and an awful storyline concerning aliens who use discarded meat from a butcher shop as fuel for their spaceship . The film contains some blood ( not enough to disturb ) and a character with an eggbeater replacing one of his hands . ( Yes you read that correctly . ) One saving grace was a song performed at the " talent show " ( how 's that for irony ? ) by a punk / new wave band that I think was called " I 'm A Heat Seeking Missile " . Other than that , this is not worth your time , not even on a " so bad it 's good " level . Watch if you are into cheesy alien films , but anyone else should steer clear .   Rating : 1 out of 10
pos	" The Luzhin Defence " is , in the foreground , a story of an idiosyncratic chess savant ( Turturro ) who becomes consumed by the game and , in the background via flashbacks , his boyhood life and the forces which created the man he has become . Factor in good and evil in the forms of his his love interest ( Watson ) and former " mentor " ( Wilson ) respectively and you have a plaintive drama laced with poignant and delicately humorous moments mingled with the rich scenic beauty of Italy 's Lake Como and the intensity of high chess play . An excellent film for those into period dramas , the auteur 's euphemistic chess play metaphor for orgasmic delight is an indication of the subtle wit behind the film .
neg	* * HERE BE SPOILERS * * The government has continued to develop the UniversalSoldier program , now called UniSol . The soldiers are now stronger and are able to take more damage than before . However the government is downsizing , the project endangered and the supercomputer that is in the middle of all feel threatened , so he takes steps to ensure his own safety . He activates and controls the UniSols and start to run mayhem . The only one who can stop them is Deveraux ( Van Damme ) .   This movie is about one thing . Choreographed fighting . The story is bad , and is soon drowned in all fights . Whatever happens , and wherever they go , they fight . Unfortunately for this movie , it is no fun watching a fight where you know one part of it is indestructible . Normally you 're pretty sure the hero will win , but you still want to feel the fights are between two somewhat equal combatants . Not where one is indestructible and ca n't lose . Then the fights just become a tool to stretch time . You wait until the final fight when Deveraux miraculously finds a way to beat his unbeatable foes . To further lower my opinion , a desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is how much scantily clad women there are . Well , there are n't really that lot of them , because the characters are most men ( there are at least one woman UniSol though ) , but almost every woman is needlessly shown with at least just a bra once . The female leads get by with this , but we also pass through a strip - club ( to use a computer no less ) with much more undressed women . These moments do not give anything to the story and is just there to try to please the adolescent - minded male audience . So , in conclusion , boring fights . No more , no less . Well , maybe less ... 2/10
pos	Running Man is n't a great movie , in fact it 's kinda silly . But it delivers what you want in an Arnie movie and that is action and entertainment . I do n't see how anyone could n't enjoy this picture , it 's so silly and over the top , that it almost makes fun of itself . By the way , this is probably one of the most quotable Arnie movies out there .
neg	Being an independent filmmaker and a huge fan of Edward D. Wood Jr. I purchased this documentary believing that this would finally set the record straight on how gifted and brilliant Ed Wood actually was .   What I got was a disappointing self - centered , conflictive , contradictory compilation of bitter self - aggrandizing has - beens .   Where people DO remember Ed Wood Jr. , do people actually remember the second cousin of the guy with the duct tape who knew someone who was in Plan Nine From Outer Space ?   It appears as though , the very minute there is a renewed interest in Ed Wood , these people come out of the " Wood"work ! Only to take mean spirited swipes at someone who actually gave them a chance when no - one else would ! After 50 years I would suggest that many of these people should let go of the fact that they did n't get the $ 75 they were promised ! Ed Wood was a brilliant creative filmmaker who knew how to entertain . In - fact that was ALL he lived for . You may giggle when you see Ed 's films , but somehow you are aware that you are laughing WITH him , and not AT him .   But , I digress ... Back to the film at hand . If you are expecting a film ABOUT Edward D. Wood Jr. , you wo n't get it here . If you want a film about cranky bitter old actors , this is the film for you !
pos	I enjoy Ralph Bakshi films ( " Wizards " , " Cool World " and the underrated animated " Lord of the Rings " ) and am a Frank Frazetta collector and fan . I am also a sword and sorcery fan who loves the worlds of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard . I missed " Fire and Ice 's " theatrical release back in 1983 and have looked forward to seeing it on video or at some revival ever since then . Therefore the 2005 release was a dream come true for me . However , I bought it with some trepidation , because I hoped it would not be only worth watching once and then put on the shelf as a " collectible " gathering dust until the day I died . Fortunately my fears were groundless and I was pleasantly impressed with this movie . As with Frazetta art this is a gritty film that has a physicality and sexuality that is hard to find in most fantasy / sword and sorcery films without being cheesy or dirty . The art is good and you see glimpses of Frazetta at his best . Even my young boys loved watching it with me and ask to watch it again and again . However , my wife has some objections due to the scantily clad princess ( very Frazetta - esquire ) . I do n't mind that because it is believable and there is no sex scene . There is roto - scoping used , but personally I enjoy roto - scoping . It gives more fluid and realistic movements to the characters that is hard to find in animation . Despite some continuity problems , I recommend this film to all Bakshi , Frazetta , Conan , and sword and sorcery fans . Enjoy !
neg	After watching the first 20mn of Blanche(sorry I could n't take more of it ) , I have now confirmed she does not .   Basically , this " movie " is an insult to the real french actors participating in this farcical piece of junk . It starts from a concept successfully used in French comedies ( " Deux heures moins le quart avant Jesus Christ " , " La Folie des Grandeurs " , ... ) : a historical movie with anachronic tone / dialogues . This can give brilliant results if supported by brilliant actors and a " finesse " of direction avoiding the dreaded " heavy comedy " stigma . Unfortunately , the horsey - faced Lou Doillon ruins everything and Blanche , instead of a comedy , just turns into an horror movie . Horror to cinephiles who want to be puzzled and shocked watching fine actors such as Decaune , Zem or Rochefort struggling in the middle of this gaudy burlesque kitchy - prissy farce .
pos	Although this lovely work of art does use some of the cinematic vocabulary of surrealism , it is in fact nothing of the sort . It is a political and cultural allegory of Mexico 's post - Columbian odyssey , as even a passing glance at Mexico 's history will attest .   In contrast to " Like Water for Chocolate , " " Erendira " expects the viewer to meet it at least half way so that understanding it takes a little work . ( A good starting point is to see the grandmother character as Spain : proud , aloof , sorrowful and , above all else , weighed - down - with - history . ) The ultimate actions of the heroine are obscure because the " outcome " of history ( i.e. the present ) is always obscure , since we are too close to it for honest evaluation . Refusal to neatly tie up loose ends is the only real choice available to the director , given the ambitions of the film . " Erendira " is gorgeous . A big - screen experience would be ideal , if you can catch it at a local art house or university screening . But if not , VHS is better than never seeing it at all .
neg	I saw this movie at the Edmonton International Film Festival , with the great Dr. Uwe Boll in attendance . The film is , simply put , very , very bad . And no , not in the usual Uwe Boll " so bad it 's actually entertaining " way , but just plain bad . The plot concerns a man who leads a terrible life ( because of a past criminal record , apparently ) , ca n't get a job , and with an awful 900 pound cheating wife . This man turns to his cult - leader uncle in a plan to steal a truck load of toys that contain the bird flu virus . Al Qaeda also has designs on stealing the toys , and what follows is just under two hours of completely incomprehensible sex and violence . The acting is awful ( except for Dave Foley , who really tries , despite it all ) , the jokes never rise above children being shot in the chest in slow motion , and people taking a poo . It 's supposed to be satire , but I 'm not sure of what . Think " Airplane ! " , but done by the creators of South Park , and without any jokes .
pos	Spectacular Horror movie that will give you the chills once you get settled with it . The atmosphere is very creepy and stylish , the score is chilling , but the best about the movie is it 's performances . It 's rare to get scared by performances and this movie 's solid acting plays an important part in the scare factor . The story is very interesting and gets your attention since the first minutes . Though the woman in black does not have much screen time , she makes the necessary appearances to chill the audience in some brilliant scenes . The dialogs are very descriptive and make your imagination work and that 's when it becomes really scary .   If you have the chance , watch this on theater it 's a totally different experience but as scary as this movie . This is one of the best Ghost movies ever and it 's directed for people that want to get scared .
neg	This is a bigger budgeted film than usual for genre director Honda ( with more evidently elaborate sets )  though the special effects still have that distinctive cheesiness to them ( witness the giant bats and rodents on display ) . It also utilizes a surprising number of American actors : Joseph Cotten playing the visionary scientist looks ill - at - ease and frail ( but , then , his character is supposed to be 204 years old ! ) , an innocuous Richard Jaeckel is the photographer hero while , as chief villains , we get Cesar Romero and Patricia Medina ( both essentially campy ) . As I 've often said , I grew up watching English - language films dubbed in Italian  but hearing Hollywood actors in Japanese is another thing entirely !   LATITUDE ZERO feels like a juvenile version of a typical Jules Verne adventure , and is fairly entertaining on that level ; indeed , it 's preferable to Honda 's low - brow variations on the monsters - on - the - rampage formula because of the inherent quaint charm of the set - up in this case . The plot involves the kidnapping of a famous scientist by Romero  he was intended to establish himself in the underwater , technologically advanced city devised by Cotten ( to which the world 's foremost minds are being recruited ) . We 're treated to plenty of silly battles between the rival subs , but the most amusing scenes are certainly the raid on Romero 's cave  in fact , Cotten doing somersaults and fending off men in rubber suits ( via flames and laser emitted from his glove ! ) must surely count as the nadir of his acting career ; the other elder in the cast , Romero , is more in his element  after all , he had been The Joker in the BATMAN TV series and movie of the 1960s ! Cotten has a scantily - clad blonde physician on his team , and is assisted by a hulking Asian ; Romero , on the other hand , is flanked by an Oriental femme fatale  who , however , ends up getting a raw deal for her efforts ( the girl 's brain is eventually transplanted into a hybrid of lion and condor  which is among the phoniest - looking creatures you ever saw ! ) . Apparently , a 2-disc set of this one from Media Blasters streets on this very day ! !
pos	I went into this movie after having read it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift , who was made into a monster by society . Suffice to say I was expecting something entirely different from what I got . But it was a happy surprise . My friend and I both thought the movie was very romantic ( the fact that the male lead is n't bad to look at surely helped ) , and there was enough plot development , action and even humor ( the fact that it takes them until the 3rd part of the movie to now each other 's name had the whole movietheatre laughing ) to keep you entertained and invested in the story . So in short : Not what I expected , but a very good surprise indeed . I 'll definitely buy this movie when it comes out on DVD .
neg	The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it was bad enough to be comedic . Everyone in this movie looks like a porn industry drop out . I have actually seen better acting in low budget porn . I though I had actually rented some kind of gay porn after this classic scene : Jim : Watch your ass Nick : You watch yours ( together ) : I wo nt leave you behind ! The first action sequence shows how awful the production is , but its really kind of funny : Good guys have transformer weapons ! In one scene , they all have fake HK MP5 sub - machine guns . Next scene , AK-47 replicas ! And then , to top it all off , they do some weapon swapping between scenes with a couple of M-16s ! ! I think they had a budget shortage for guns , not enough to go around between the good guys and bad guys . Fight scenes are poorly coordinated and fake as all hell . You have to remove the pin / spoon from a grenade for it to explode on its own . You ca n't fire a shoulder launched missile of any kind while riding inside a helicopter . Weapons that you throw away do n't suddenly re - appear . When a gun is out of bullets , throwing it away is still pretty stupid . Unless you have no idea how to reload them .. Big slow trucks driving around in first gear make for awkward action scenes . I really ca nt believe movies like this are actually produced . This movie would be hilarious on nitrous oxide or maybe just drunk .
pos	I 've just purchased the restored version of a film that I remember with much affection from childhood and it 's certainly made for a curious afternoon 's entertainment . Bedknobs definitely makes more sense in its complete form , the deleted scenes ( especially those with McDowall ) link events together quite neatly . What is a little disconcerting is the way the scenes have been remastered . Clearly , the soundtrack to this footage had been lost or damaged , so some bright spark at Disney decided to dub the scenes with new dialogue . Which would have been great except that half the cast were n't around to do it ( some for better reasons than others ) and the whole thing has a rather shoddy quality to it . Some of the lip - synching is pretty poor , and David Tomlinson 's voice has been dubbed by a bloke who sounds absolutely nothing like David Tomlinson ( there 's actually a hint of German in it , I think ) . However , good to hear the full versions of all the songs ( although ' Step in the right Direction ' is still absent ) and the moments of magic in this film still shine through . And I challenge you not to giggle when young Paul gazes so innocently at Angela Lansbury and coos " but what 's that got to do with my knob ? ? "
neg	This was one of the most boring " horror " movies that I have ever seen . A college kid has an epidemic of nightmares involving roaming spirits at Alcatraz . Trying to deliver a mix of " Nightmare on Elm Street " and standard vampire fare in the form of a bad 80s music video , this movie is jammed full of bad acting and an exhaustively slow moving story . Although , being such a bad , and often laughable movie ( dig those mullets and the terrible dialog ) , it would be good material to spoof on for an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 . Do n't be fooled by the proud mention of the film being the 1987 winner of the Silver Scroll Award by the Academy of Sicence Fiction , Fanatasy , and Horror , or that Devo contributes to the soundtrack , or that Tony Basil has a part in the film . It is a giant disaster , though one with a small cult following ( see the other IMDb comments for this film ) .
pos	Military training films are becoming so common that they are becoming a genre unto themselves . Among the more prominent we have , ` Officer and a Gentleman ' , ` Top Gun ' , ` GI Jane ' , and now ` Men of Honor ' . The fact that this one happened to be true does n't change the fact that the formula is the same . This film is probably most like ` GI Jane ' since it focuses on the desegregation angle . The story is actually quite inspirational and is probably the best human - interest story among those mentioned above . Carl Brashear ( Cuba Gooding , Jr. ) is unquestionably a man of great courage and principle , and his strength of character shines through brightly in this film . Unfortunately , director George Tillman has tunnel vision in presenting the characters and eschews character development of various characters other than Brashear in favor of showing Brashear in a constant state of adversity . Billy Sunday ( Robert De Niro ) is a central figure , and except for the initial scene , the fistfight and a couple of scenes with his wife , we do n't know much about him . For instance , Brashear sees the scars on Sunday 's palms and we are to assume that he worked a plow , but there is no follow - up on that point . Mr. Pappy ( Hal Holbrook ) gets only one short scene by which we can judge him . The rest of his screen time shows him pacing around and ranting . If a director is going to make a human - interest story , he needs to humanize the characters . Cuba Gooding Jr. gives an outstanding performance as Brashear . This is probably the best I 've seen him . This is a role and a character that is far more complete than any part he has played before , and he rises to the occasion . In ` Jerry Maguire ' , Rod Tidwell was a fascinating , but one - dimensional character with the depth of a rain puddle . Brashear is much more complex and grounded , and the issues he faces are life crises , making the part far more challenging . This is an excellent recovery from Gooding 's last role in ` Chill Factor ' , a film so dreadful that it was almost an act of professional suicide to take the part . After a stint trying his hand as a comedian ( ` Analyze This ' , ` The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle ' , ` Meet The Parents ' ) , Robert DeNiro is back to his dramatic roots with an outstanding performance . DeNiro is n't a bad comedian , he is just such a great dramatic actor that it seems like he should n't waste his time doing comedy . DeNiro endows Billy Sunday with a rock hard personality belying a tortured soul . It is a pleasure watching him work .   It seems every film I watch lately has Charlize Theron in it . I saw ` The Legend of Bagger Vance ' , ` Men of Honor ' and ` The Yards ' right in a row and I was beginning to wonder if she had a part in every film in 2000 ( actually , she only did five ) . This was a minor role for Theron , but she carried it off well and managed to stay with DeNiro step for step . David Keith , who co - starred with Richard Gere in ` Officer and a Gentleman ' , has a cameo here The DVD has some interesting special features , including reflections by the real Carl Brashear and some deleted scenes . I enjoyed this film despite the hackneyed plot and the one - dimensional presentation . I rated it a 7/10 . I 'm a sucker for underdog stories and I have a fondness for stories where strength of character is the central theme . This film is particularly strong in both areas and brings us two memorable acting performances that compensate for some of the director 's shortcomings .
neg	Who ever wrote the two or three glowing reviews were either involved in the making of this film , term used loosely , or bank rolling it , and should the latter be the case , I would want my seven dollars back ! The actors , again term used loosely , are awful , in fact almost none of them did anything ever again which is a relief . The scenery and everything about this screams , we had 7 dollars to work with and a day to do it in . Was this filmed in someones back yard ? Everything about this project says , low budget . The actors at best were D list . Do not waste your time , unless of course you want to take it back and try to get the rental back . The lead bad guy looks like that punk from the 70s show that ended up marrying his grandmother dummee moore . My local blockbuster video store lists this as the movie most returned with sad commentary attached . Even as a 99 cent rental this flick gathers dust . Someone really must have owed some favors . This is a super stinker and I give it 10 turds .
pos	With the sun shining brilliantly on a quiet Sunday that is just about to fully wake up , love can be felt in the soft breeze that sweeps past my feet and can be seen in the smiles of the people I walk alongside . It is the perfect day to stop off for croissants and a café - o - lait before heading off to the city of lights and love . Of course , a flight to Paris is not reasonably in this humble film critic 's budget so I had to opt for the next best thing , Paris , JE T'AIME , a collection of 18 short films by a variety of international directors . Each piece is named after a different Parisian neighborhood and is a reflection on love . Careful not to over glorify the most powerful and persuasive of all human emotions , Paris , JE T'AIME explores love at the many stages of its own game . The results are spontaneously romantic and surprisingly consistent . And truly , what better way to express the fleeting nature of love and how a moment can change your life than with a collection of filmed moments .   The beautifully poetic quote above is taken from Tom Tykwer 's Faubourg Saint Denis . True to form , Tykwer ( RUN , LOLA , RUN ) uses time - lapse photography and repetition to demonstrate the entire cycle of love , from inception to dissolution . Originally shot in 2004 and paired down for this anthology , Faubourg stars Natalie Portman as Francine , an American actress in Paris for a part in a film , and Melchior Beslon as Thomas , a blind man she falls in love with . Here , the blind leads the blind through the most unstable of terrain , where two people consume each other to a point where their lives nearly lose their own existences . As love seems to go from dazzling to dizzying , Tykwer reminds us of the tricks it can play on our minds and the illusions it can create when we stray towards doubt . Perhaps the most giddily romantic offering comes from Sylvain Chomet 's Tour Eiffel . Choosing the city 's most identifiable attraction for its title , Chomet ( LES TRIPLETTES DE BELLEVILLE ) gives us a little boy who tells the story of how his parents met and fell in love . His father , a mime ( Paul Putner ) , finds himself falling into one surreal scenario after another and eventually lands himself in jail . This is where he meets the woman who will become the love of his life ( Yolande Moreau ) . Miming has become something of a dying art , if it is n't already dead . Yet by nature , it is dreamy and untroubled . Miming points its silent finger at the ridiculousness of human behaviour and what but love can make people act more absurd ? We might find someone special in the least likely of circumstances if we could just take ourselves a little less seriously . Paris , JE T'AIME keeps the flow lively by not always focusing on love between lovers . Three memorable shorts focus on the love between a parent and a child . Walter Salles ( MOTORCYCLE DIARIES ) has Catalina Sandino Moreno singing lovingly to her child before she leaves him to sing the same song with a distant longing to the child she watches over for her living . Nobuhiro Suwa ( UN COUPLE PARFAIT ) has Juliette Binoche trying desperately to overcome the emptiness she feels after losing her son . Binoche says very little yet , not surprisingly given her immense talent , her struggle is evident in her face as she learns that love sometimes means letting go . And Alfonso Cuaron ( CHILDREN OF MEN ) weighs in with one continuous shot of a father ( Nick Nolte ) and his grown daughter ( Sara Martins ) walking together for what must be the first time in a long while . We see them only from across the street and we only get close to them as the distance between the two characters narrows to a place of comfort and accepting . The last short to screen is Alexander Payne 's 14ieme Arrondissement . As usual , Payne ( SIDEWAYS ) takes an ordinary person and shows us what makes them extraordinary . Carol ( Margo Martindale ) is another American in Paris . She is there alone and for less time than she would have liked as she has dogs waiting for her at home . She is a plain person with an uneventful life who finds herself in a city that is rich and lush . In beautifully delivered Americanized French , she muses about the sights and how being there makes her feel . This woman spends so much time trying to be happy despite life 's numerous disappointments and as she sits in a city made for lovers , she realizes that she is in fact happy and loves herself more than she knew . She falls in love , if only for perhaps a moment , with life and love itself . The characters that appear but fleetingly in Paris , JE T'AIME find themselves at the romantic center of the universe . The moments they share with each other , be it helping someone up after a hard fall or reaching out your hand to another person without touching them or without their knowledge , are the moments that give love its flare and flourish . Outside the city of lovers , it can be easy to miss moments such as these but we must remind ourselves of their significance . It takes but a moment for love to shine through a cloudy sky . You just have to keep your heart open to see it . And if one city can be so abundant with love , one has to believe it can find its way one day to your door .
neg	Wow , the plot for this film is all over the place ! There is so much plot and so many things that happen that it practically made my head spin ! ! And , as a result , none of it seemed particularly believable . The movie starts with Kay Francis as a housewife living in a small town . She 's had some experience with local theater and has ambitions of going to Broadway . When a big - time actor arrives in town , she pursues him in hopes that he can give her a career boost . But , her husband is worried about shenanigans -- as this actor is a cad . So , the hubby bursts in on them and hits the actor -- and the actor dies ! As a result , he 's convicted of First Degree Murder ! ! ! Not Manslaughter , but Murder 1 ! Now , pregnant and in need of funds , Kay goes to New York . But Broadway jobs are n't to be found , so she 's forced to take any job -- even Burlesque . Unable to adequately care for her young daughter , she gives it to another woman to raise . However , eventually she does find a job in a real Broadway play and everything looks rosy . But , the jealous diva starring in the play hates her for some inexplicable reason and forces her to be thrown off the play . Despondent , she makes her way to England and becomes a real star . Years later , she returns to New York to get her kid -- but the child is older and thinks the woman caring for her is her real mother . At the same time , her husband 's lawyer now thinks that if he gets $ 10,000 he can get the man out of prison . As another reviewer wrote , is this to bribe people ? ! How can $ 10,000 get him out otherwise -- maybe it will buy a helicopter so they can fly into the prison yard and scoop him up ! ! Wow -- this is enough for 2 or 3 films ! And , all this occurs by the 45 minute mark ! ! ! Believe it or not , there 's quite a bit more to it . If you really care , see it yourself to find out how it all unfolds . This is sort of like ' kitchen sink writing'--throwing in practically everything and hoping , somehow , it will all work . Unfortunately , the film turns out to be hopelessly unbelievable and mushy despite Ms. Francis ' best efforts . It 's the sort of film no one could really have saved thanks to a 2nd - rate plot . It 's almost as if someone just took a few dozen plot elements , threw them into a box and then began randomly picking them in order to make a movie ! ! Overall , unless you are a die - hard Kay Francis fan or love anything Hollywood made in the 1930s , this one is one you can easily skip . Not terrible but certainly not good . By the way , the child who plays Francis ' daughter upon her return to New York ( Sybil Jason ) really was terrible . I think she was supposed to be ... I think .
pos	It 'd be easy to call Guys and Dolls great . It 's got Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando ( and , contrary to Sinatra 's original wishes , the casting works ) , it 's got a really cool 1950s feel , even if it is basically transposed from stage to screen with only a little interruption . And most of the songs are often a lot of fun , and catchy , and performed with that wink and nod to the wonderful escapism inherent in the form itself . If it 's not entirely as great as some others of its ilk , it should n't be any fault of the filmmaker Joseph L. Mankiewicz . Not all the songs entirely click , and a little of the dialog feels like it 's being performed for the stage as opposed to film ( it 's hard to tell at times- Brando and Sinatra straddle the line so often that one has to watch carefully to tell when one plays for the camera or for the " stage " , while the actress playing Adele is better for stage than screen ) . The plot is one of those winners that works well for its period , even if one wonders if its influence has stretched to the likes of 1999 's She 's All That ( well , not quite , but close ) . A gambler ( and 14-year betrothed ) , played by Sinatra , wants to host a big - time game , but is told that the " heat is on " , meaning the cops are on watch . So , he has only one choice to host the game , with a thousand dollar tab . The only way he can get it is through a big - time bet with fellow gambler Brando , who 's put on to make a wild wooing job of a mission worker . It allows for the predictable twists in the story , in the sudden turn - on - turn - off of the charms of the character , of the idiosyncrasies of people from the streets ( gangsters and dancers and the " saitn " played by Jean Simmons who falls for Brando ) . It is , in its basic concept , about this whole world of guys and dolls , and how to balance one or the other- obviously without getting married or too compromised . Mankiewicz brings a lot of energy to the piece , even when keeping still with the camera on the subject , and his stars are properly reeled in . Hell , even Brando works excellently for a musical as he goes beyond being simply THE method actor and shows his chops for singing and big - star quality . The story and characters eventually wind down to what you 'd hope will happen , and that 's fine . All we ask for- and what we get- is entertainment in good spurts of witty , involving dialog , and a few songs and dances that bring the house down ( my favorites were the number with the lady - cats at the club , Luck be a Lady , and the two numbers down in Havana , Cuba ) . A-
neg	This movie has beautiful scenery . Unfortunately it has no plot . In order to have a plot there must be a conflict . This movie had none . It spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and failed to ever place any activity in it . The picture tries to be artistic but fails to pay attentions to the fundamentals of story telling . If you love Montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just do n't expect a story . There is n't one .
pos	Cinderella is one of Disney 's greatest films , one of those films I think you appreciate more the older you get . Disney creates a magical adaptation of the classic fairytale . I consider the film to have been the greatest of his films at the time of its release . The characters became more dimensional than earlier films , creating more depth to appreciate the characters more . Cinderella herself is , in my opinion , one of the greatest characters Disney ever created . With her kindness and dash of dry humor , she is extremely likeable ; however , it is the inspiration she provides which makes her memorable . Like many people she is an endless dreamer , and she holds onto her dreams , never giving up . Even in the most adverse of situations , her dreams endure , and she wo n't let anyone take that away from her . Her example should serve as inspiration to everyone , and encouragement to never let go of your dreams .
neg	The film gives a rather condensed version of what is contained in the book , which as far as I can tell by doing some research and investigative fact checking is largely a work of fiction . In reality , there are no ancient scrolls and if the author was hard pressed I 'm sure he 'd have to admit he 's never laid eyes on any scrolls in ancient Aramaic found in Peru . These " valuable " texts written as usual by anonymous , were destroyed by the evil " truth haters " in the church and in the local government . That 's rather strange , as all kinds of New Age crap comes out each year --- hundreds of books , dozens of movies -- and the Roman Catholic church does n't seem to me to be hell bent on destroying the movement which it probably views as I do , a total crock of doody . I 'm no fan of the church , mind you , but at least the ancient texts which they base their faith on are real . It 's a typical pattern of scam artists and religious hucksters to claim to have seen or translated ancient documents which unfortunately got destroyed by " evil " men or in Joseph Smith 's case , got taken back to Heaven once translated . Therefore , the actual texts can not be found in any museums like the Smithsonian , nor the translations checked by specialists in ancient languages like Coptic or Aramaic . It 's a scam . In one sense , I admire anybody smart enough to come up with a great idea and make millions off it , but I could n't do it myself , as I 've no desire to mislead the public with more New Agey hokum . Occasionally , a genuine ancient text does get found hidden away and lost for years . The Gospel of Judas , a Gnostic text , was discovered and after carbon dating and diligent study of the text , deemed authentic by experts . The Gospel of Judas was referenced as heretical around 300 C.E .. No church documents from that time mention any Celestine Prophecies as authentic , heretical or anything else . We are evolving towards something -- that much is true --- but the optimism in the Celestine Prophecy is based on nothing but fiction and lies , and a philosophy built on a foundation of lies , like a castle built on sand will collapse . The harsh , ugly , overpopulated , cruel world of Blade Runner is more likely what it 'll be like over the Horizon , than some Utopian Hippie Commune where all is love and peace ! I tell people the truth and they hate me , but tell them what they want to hear , even if pure piffle , and one can make millions . The Celestine Prophecy is what the world wants to hear . Too bad it is a castle built on sand . Do n't get me wrong . I wish to God , the Celestine Vision was reality , only it 's not . No ancient philosophy at any time expressed ideas given in the Insights with the modern concept of spiritual evolution going hand in hand with biological evolution . These New Agey ideas did not exist in the ancient world and did not exist until Darwininan Evolution became well - known . That means the ideas in the Celestine Prophecies can not be older than the 1800s C.E , and do not go back to the early B.C.E period or near the time of Jesus of Nazareth . This type of claim by New Agers is not at all unusual . Wiccans claim their brand of magic and witchcraft -- the " old religion " goes back to the stone age , when in reality no Book of Shadows has ever been known to exist prior to Gerald Gardner who lived in the 1900s and was the buddy of Aleister Crowley . New Age gurus tell lies and claim their ideas are based on ancient teachings , when the ancients would thumb their noses at such absurdities that are preached by Gurus today . Why do they do what they do , perpetrate such fraud ? Simple : there are millions of dollars to be made , and the modern Guru acquires power over his or her followers . They compete fiercely and have a strong hatred for their competition despite their claims of love for all things . Each New Age group bitter opposes the others . It 's a struggle for your minds and your wallets . But learn one thing from me , that is actually similar to one of the insights , learn to follow your own instincts and look for guidance from within . That I can agree with wholeheartedly .
pos	Seeing this movie was the most fun I 've had at the cinema in a long time . However , I am not able to say whether this is a good or a bad film , because such simple qualifications simply can not be applied . This picture has everything any movie could ever have . It has characteristics of a romantic comedy , a political commentary , a thriller , a drama , an action movie , a musical , and an absurdist self - conscious art film . It 's all in there , adding up to a myth . The basic premise is about an Indian couple , Nandini ( Karishma Kapoor ) and Shekhar ( Sanjay Kapoor ) , happily living in Canada , who rush to India to visit the husband 's parents after a disturbing news report . The rest of the story takes place in India , where the couple find themselves in the midst of a plot of fratricidal violence . At one point , the story borrows from " Not without my baby , " but to call Shakti a remake of anything would be an injustice . The ostensible story line takes a backseat to a number of astonishing interruptions , including Shah Rukh Khan 's dream of Aishwarya Rai which comes as if out of another movie . In fact , the two stars are on all the posters , but they appear really late in the film , and only Shah Rukh ends up being a real character . Yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance . Karishma Kapoor is the one with most work to do in this film , and she does an admirable job , having to link up the film 's twists and turns with a show of believable emotion . Another notable presence is Nana Patekar , who plays Narsimha , the tyrannical father of the husband Shekhar . Nana Patekar dominates every scene he 's in with a scary but nuanced character . The movie is not without its share of realism . Violence is rampant , but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters , with Karishma getting soundly beaten on a number of occasions . At times , this violence is clearly disturbing but ultimately it becomes surreal as every dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is nothing but cathartic . I have seen a share of Bollywood releases , and the mixing of genres and incredible plot resolutions are certainly their norm . But " Shakti " raises the bar by absorbing an even greater masala without becoming ridiculous . It is a film that achieves the grandeur of a Shakespearian tragedy , where the audience of the rabble and royalty is equally entertained . It is pure , gratuitous cinema , and the director Krishna Vamsi must have had a dream of a good time by throwing in every trick in the book . Perhaps , the all - important message of violence begetting violence and the inspiring extents of motherly love were not the thoughts on my mind , but I came out of watching " Shakti " exhilarated . Making movies can be the most fun in the world !
neg	An awful film ! It must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the Golden Globe . They 've taken the story of the first famous female Renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition . My complaint is not that they 've taken liberties with the facts ; if the story were good , that would perfectly fine . But it 's simply bizarre -- by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film , so why did they come up with this dishwater - dull script ? I suppose there were n't enough naked people in the factual version . It 's hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artist 's life -- we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they 'd favored the rest of the film with same brevity .
pos	I really liked this movie I saw the original classic a few times but could hardly remember any details . I think this movie is much better than the cartoon its not so black and white as it . I specially liked how they made the grinch such a complete character and gave a cause of why he was the way he was , the villain in this movie was not the actual Grinch but the Major , much different than the original cartoon . Jim Carrey was perfect for the part all in all a great movie made for both kids and adults alike .
neg	This movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies . Horrible .   There was n't a continuous minute where there was n't a fight with one monster or another . There was no chance for any character development , they were too busy running from one sword fight to another . I had no emotional attachment ( except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them )   Scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies , LOTR , Star Wars and Matrix .   Examples > The ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda , Obee One and Vader .   > The spider machine in the beginning was exactly like Frodo being attacked by the spider in Return of the Kings . ( Elijah Wood is the victim in both films ) and wait ...... it hypnotizes ( stings ) its victim and wraps them up ..... uh hello ? ? ? ? > And the whole machine vs. humans theme WAS the Matrix .. or Terminator ..... There are more examples but why waste the time ? And will someone tell me what was with the Nazi 's ? ! ? ! Nazi 's ? ? ? ?   There was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion . The movie could not decide if it was a children 's movie or an adult movie and was n't much of either .   Just awful . A real disappointment to say the least . Save your money .
pos	The first collaboration between Schoedsack & Cooper is a compelling documentary on the migration of the Bakhtiari tribe of Persia . Twice a year , more than 50,000 people and half a million animals cross rivers and mountains to get to pasture . You 'll feel like a pampered weakling after watching these people herd their animals through ice cold water and walk barefoot through the snow to cross the mountains while trying to get their animals to walk along steep and narrow mountain paths .
neg	Manoj Agrawal after the failure of PARDESI BABU(1998 ) returned with this film The film has Govinda in 8 - 9 roles , as his father , mother , grandfather , sister and later - on he also has disguises   He in short is a useless detective send on a case by his friend to get proofs against his wife , whose photos he looses at the airport while flirting with Rani He disguises as a Sardarji in the plane and again as a girl The funny part is how easily and in short time he does that ? Then he disguises as a french singer and enters a TV to get proofs lol and then as a maharashtrian(yes inside the TV itself )   The rest of the film has the same mistaken identities and ends on a predictable note There are some funny scenes like Govinda being bashed by an African and also many other portions   Direction by Manoj Agrawal is okay Music is okay Amongst actors Govinda again proves he is one of the most watchable actors He as usual is fantastic though he has done such roles before he fits in all the get ups and roles too well here again though the much hyped 6 - 7 roles do n't actually fit in the film Rani looks fat , teams up well with Govinda thatz it She is nothing great and kept doing such type of roles Amongst rest Nirmal Pandey is as usual Johny Lever is too loud at times and funny in places in 1 role and irritates as the older Tinnu Anand is okay Satish Kaushik is hilarious , Paresh is okay Tanaaz is okay
pos	It 's a little disconcerting to have a character named Gig Young in a movie ... played by Gig Young . But this film is where Gig got his name and also a nice career boost after playing small parts under another name . I 'm going to go against the majority of the other comments and state that I really enjoyed this film , mainly because of the vibrant performance of Barbara Stanwyck as Fiona . She was funny , angry , vulnerable , caring , and feisty as the oldest of three daughters whose mother died on the Lusitania , and whose father was later killed during Woar War I.   As the " man " of the house , Fiona has stood steadfast for years against settling her father 's will which would therefore allow a Donald Trump type named Charles Barclay to get the family home . But Fiona 's keeping a secret as to why she hates Barclay so much . Geraldine Fitzgerald is the middle , flirty sister , who is married to an Englishman but craves her youngest sister 's boyfriend ( Gig Young ) . If you 're a Stanwyck fan , this is a no miss .
neg	Simply awful slasher , molded from the I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER type of fodder , has beautiful wealthy college students spending spring break in a Florida condo being murdered one by one . A misfire in every category imaginable from properly built suspense to the executed death sequences .. nothing is handled properly and the characters leave little more than caricatures you root to see decimated as quick as possible . Del Tenney(The Curse of the Living Corpse;I Eat Your Skin ) , of all people , executive produced , co - wrote , and stars as a priest in a pivotal role whose relationship to the killer I guess means something to why he 's psychotic . The revelation of the killer is awkwardly handled and ineffective , probably not surprising a soul who watches it . There are a lot of attempted jump scares , with one character popping out to frighten their friend , which could n't even manufacture a few cheap thrills , because they are so calculated in such a tepid way . Most of the attacks occur off - screen with bleeding throat cuts( .. or pools)representing the only real display of violence . The protracted finale , where the killer goes on and on with the actor desperately trying to make his villain as diabolical and demented as possible , is embarrassing and tense - less . There 's not one single positive to derive from this clichéd and dull exercise with the pretty cast making little effort to rise past their one - dimensional roles . And , for pity sake , they could 've at least allowed us to see Joey Lawrence get decapitated or something for withstanding the misery of sitting through this junk heap for 90 agonizing minutes . Dorie Barton , as the heroine final girl , Beth Morgan , who the killer seems to be obsessed with , could n't be more vacuous and uninteresting( .. oh , she was in rehab , and takes pills for her nightmares;such intriguing exposition ) . Chad Allen , cast against type as a very intimidating " friend " of the group( .. who happens to disappear from the film first , setting up the idea that he 's the first victim ) , has a tough hill to climb with his role , so steep he eventually stumbles , rolling uncontrollably with no end in sight . Jeff Conaway , needing some cash I guess , has the beleaguered FBI agent role , whose daughter 's murder motivates him to seek out the killer , leading him to Florida . Jack McGee has his usual a$$hole role as a smart - mouth Florida Police Chief who is often nose to nose with Conaway 's agent . Oh , the answer to the title 's question .. not really . Because once you get the answer , you will wonder why you bothered with this anyway .
pos	When I first saw this film in the 1980 's , I was in my middle teenage years and somewhat reluctant to see this since I considered myself grown up and out of the " Sesame Street / Muppets " age . I honestly do n't remember if I liked it at the time or not . However , somewhere in college I watched this film again , and it wound up going ( and staying ) into my personal Best Films Ever collection . This film is LOADED with humor that goes far above and beyond what one would have expected from the Muppets . I mean , obviously the Muppets always have appealed to adults and children because there 's humor geared towards both generations . But come on ... Janice is accidentally overheard telling someone " I do n't take my clothes off for anyone , even if it IS artistic" ... there 's a joke from a father to a son that if the son in love with Kermit the Frog then the father does n't want to hear it ... Gonzo saves a chicken with mouth - to - mouth resuscitation ( sp ? ) and afterwards says " I think we 're engaged now" ... these and plenty of other moments in the film had me rolling . Add to that very smart dialogue , very smart New York / Broadway " wink wink " humor , the usual large amount of celebrity cameos and some really enjoyable songs that do n't border on " kid - level cheesy " whatsoever ... this film is a masterpiece ! I do n't throw " 10 " 's out on a regular basis ... but this one deserves it . Over 20 years later , this film totally holds up , perhaps even more so . The Muppets never were and never will be again , as funny and smart and just plain brilliant as this film was and is . ---Q
neg	No one goes to a movie like The Hills Have Eyes 2 and expects the second coming of Citizen Kane . The same is true for the majority of low - rent horror flicks , especially those Roger Ebert has dubbed " Dead Teenager Movies . " The Hills Have Eyes 2 definitely qualifies as a Dead Teenager Movie , only here , the teenagers have been given the superficial appearance of military trainees . Some will argue the line " it 's only a movie " when questionable facts are raised in a movie review , but I 've always been a firm believer that all good fantasy must be rooted in reality in order to be effective . In the Hills Have Eyes 2 , we 're to believe the main characters are military people on a training exercise , but they look and talk like high school kids camping in the desert . The dialog is awful and frequently vulgar to excess . Though the films are n't nearly comparable , I kept imagining these " soldiers " being in Platoon , and shuddering with dread . Very little about the characters evokes a soldier other than rifles and fatigues : radio transmissions are carried out like teenage phone conversations ; a Colonel is addresses as " hey , asshole " by a Private . And nobody seems to have the slightest idea what to do , or any sense of command structure , when things begin to go wrong . I think of the soldiers in James Cameron 's Aliens , a film of pure fantasy , and how even those futuristic Marines behaved like real soldiers despite their fantastic situations . Fantasy rooted in reality . I try to begin watching a movie as a 5 on a scale of 10 , and judge it 's strengths and weaknesses from there . You have to allow concessions for the material ; there 's no way Star Wars is as good of a movie as The Godfather , on equal terms . But both are excellent examples of their type . In that respect , while the Hills Have Eyes 2 is a pretty dreadful exercise in amateur and immature writing , it 's only modestly worse in that regard than the typical Dead Teenager Movie . On a technical side , the movie appears to have decent production values and is pretty well made from that perspective . Scenes that are intended to shock , or which are intended to evoke urgency or suspense generally work . So , while watching The Hills Have Eyes 2 may indeed be a fate worse than death , there are certainly far worse horror flicks in circulation . It 's worth a watch for those who enjoy this type of stuff without the usual fanboy baggage , or those who do n't tend towards thinking every movie they see is either the Best Ever or the Worst Ever of all time . If you do n't " get " horror , especially the Dead Teenager variety , you 're not likely to have a good time with this one . 4/10
pos	One more of those brilliant young men who went all out and dared to make a teen romance film ( can i actually call it that?- it would invoke the devil out of its fans)on a micro budget but packed with such taste , sensitiveness and maturity . Peter Sollett- you deserve more admiration and respect . Thanks once again for demonstrating to the powers that be in the " industry " that stereotypes can be flushed down the toilet . One location , a handful of rich characters , low budget , good acting(and that too amateurs),decent lighting - worshippers of true indie cinema should watch more of this and STOP watching ... well ... you know what .
neg	Film critics of the world , I apologize . It is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on . But I ignored your advice and I have been deeply hurt . However , my decision to see " The Cat in the Hat " was n't made haphazardly . You see , three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the " calamity " known as " How the Grinch Stole Christmas " . Then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful , funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat . So when the critics unleashed their fury against " The Cat in the Hat " , another big budget Seuss update with a big name star in the title role , I thought that it must be the same old song . How wrong I was . For five whole minutes I thought I was in the clear . The opening credits are clever , the kids are charming and the production values are top notch . Then the cat showed up . There are many problems from this point on , but the biggest one was the woeful miscasting of Mike Myers . Where " The Grinch " was saved by the inspired casting of Jim Carrey , " The Cat " was destroyed by Myers . He can be very funny when his energies are applied where they belong , comic sketches . Every movie he 's made that was truly funny was really just a feature length comedy sketch , from " Wayne 's World " to " Austin Powers " . So he tries to do the same thing here , it 's just that these comedy sketches are more like the stuff that they stick at the end of SNL , not funny , just painful . Not that the writers helped him out any . After the charming prologue the movie turns into an hour of repulsive bodily humor gags , poorly timed pratfalls and insultingly stunted attempts at hip humor . This movie was the most disheartening cinematic experience I have ever had . Period . So much talent and work went into something so vile . I know that the adult stars of this movie will be relatively unscathed by this mess , I just hope that the wonderful Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning will get more chances to show their charms in far better movies . If you are a parent , please avoid this like the plague . With movies like " Elf " and " Brother Bear " currently in theaters , you have far better choices .
pos	I do n't know what the previous reviewer was watching but I guess that 's what reviews are , personal taste . Missed in this movie was the depth , a very deep film , many layers of emotion , affecting . Undercurrents of withheld love because of submission to societal beliefs , taboos of the times and classes , race relations not being in a very good state of equality , guilt , yearning , hate , confusion , very dark emotionally I thought , under the skin , you have to submit to the aire of it , a flowing movie , not slow as stated before , release yourself to the flow of the film , the emotions will show themselves , characters reveal their flaws , their nasty insides , excellent and actually very cruel !
neg	The Perfectly Stupid Weapon . I think the guys dancing at the beginning of one of Steven Segal 's movies was intented to mock Jeff doing his forms to dance music at the beginning of this stupid movie . The plot is predictable , the fights were fair and Jeff acts about as well as the sofa he beats with some sort of weapon in one scene .
pos	Neither the total disaster the UK critics claimed nor the misunderstood masterpiece its few fanboys insist , Revolver is at the very least an admirable attempt by Guy Ritchie to add a little substance to his conman capers . But then , nothing is more despised than an ambitious film that bites off more than it can chew , especially one using the gangster / con - artist movie framework . As might be expected from Luc Besson 's name on the credits as producer , there 's a definite element of ' Cinema de look ' about it : set in a kind of realistic fantasy world where America and Britain overlap , it looks great , has a couple of superbly edited and conceived action sequences and oozes style , all of which mark it up as a disposable entertainment . But Ritchie clearly wants to do more than simply rehash his own movies for a fast buck , and he 's spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life , the universe and everything . If anything its problem is that he 's trying to throw in too many influences ( a bit of Machiavelli , a dash of Godard , a lot of the Principles of Chess ) , motifs and techniques , littering the screen with quotes : the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of epigrams over photos of corpses of mob victims , and at times it feels as if he never read a fortune cookie he did n't want to turn into a movie . Rather than a commercial for Kabbalism , it 's really more a mixture of the overlapping principles of commerce , chess and confidence trickery that for the most part pulls off the difficult trick of making the theosophy accessible while hiding the film 's central ( somewhat metaphysical ) con . The last third is where most of the problems can be found as Jason Statham takes on the enemy ( literally ) within with lots of ambitious but not always entirely successful crosscutting within the frame to contrast people 's exterior bravado with their inner fear and anger , but it 's got a lot going for it all the same . Not worth starting a new religion over , but I 'm surprised it did n't get a US distributor . Maybe they found Ray Liotta 's intentionally fake tan just too damn scary ?
neg	Manipulative drama about a glamorous model ( Margaux Hemingway ) who is raped by a geeky but unbalanced musician ( Chris Sarandon ) – to whom she had been introduced by her younger sister ( played by real - life sibling Mariel ) , whose music teacher he is . While the central courtroom action holds the attention – thanks largely to a commanding performance by Anne Bancroft as Hemingway ’s lawyer – the film is too often merely glossy , but also dramatically unconvincing : the jury ostensibly takes the musician ’s side because a ) the girl invited assault due to the sensuous nature of her profession and b ) she was offering no resistance to her presumed aggressor when her sister arrived at the apartment and inadvertently saw the couple in bed together . What the f * * * ? ! ; she was clearly tied up – what resistance could she realistically offer ?   The second half of the film – involving Sarandon ’s rape of the sister , which curiously anticipates IRREVERSIBLE ( 2002 ) by occurring in a tunnel – is rather contrived : Mariel ’s character should have known better than to trust Sarandon after what he did to her sister , but Margaux herself foolishly reprises the line of work which had indirectly led to her humiliating experience almost immediately ! The climax – in which Sarandon gets his just desserts , with Margaux turning suddenly into a fearless and resourceful vigilante – is , however , a crowd - pleaser in the style of DEATH WISH ( 1974 ) ; incidentally , ubiquitous Italian movie mogul Dino De Laurentiis was behind both films . It ’s worth noting how the two Hemingway sisters’ lives took wildly different turns ( this was the film debut of both ) : Margaux ’s career never took off ( despite her undeniable good looks and commendable participation here ) – while Mariel would soon receive an Oscar nomination for Woody Allen ’s MANHATTAN ( 1979 ) and , interestingly , would herself play a glamorous victim of raging violence when essaying the role of real - life “ Playboy ” centerfold Dorothy Stratten in Bob Fosse ’s STAR 80 ( 1983 ) . With the added pressure of a couple of failed marriages , Margaux took refuge in alcohol and would eventually die of a drug overdose in 1996 ; chillingly , the Hemingway family had a history of suicides – notably the sisters’ grandfather , celebrated author Ernest , who died of a self - inflicted gunshot wound in 1961 .
pos	I 'm not saying that just as a Chris Rock fan , I 'm saying this as a person who had low expectations going in to this movie and was proved wrong . The first flaw was it 's everything - works - out ending that everybody saw coming . Flaw number two was I found that the chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock seemed fake . Finally the acting in this movie was sub - par , with the best actor being Regina King and the worst being Mark Addy . but I saw past that flaw and saw a solid comedy . In a heads - up scenario , watch heaven can wait instead , it 's better . So for all you Chris Rock fans out there , WATCH THIS MOVIE , you 'll enjoy out . He has some good stand - up in this movie . Overall : 7 out of 10
neg	About the worst movie in distribution right now ! I love zombie movies and saw this in the used rack so I thought why not ? Oh my god a shame to zombie movies and fans to the genre ! Whoever made this movie needs to put away your camcorder and go to film school ! There are so many gore hounds out there who have put time and effort into their films and they have something that this film does n't dignity . I know it what it takes to make films and I 'm sure there was a lot of money and time spent in making Meat Market but none of that money and time went in to making it good . You need actors , a script , a real camera , invest in some books on how to make independent films . I do n't know how you got a DVD release but whoever did that is either a really good friend or banging their head on the wall . In gore films it is quality not quantity , the effects are weak ! I was so angry that this is actually in stores and that I could n't get my money back . Please if you have seen this film write here and put an end to shlock . I know I 'm being very harsh , I only had 10 lines so I 'm trying to get to the point .
pos	You know , Robin Williams , God bless him , is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade ( with perhaps the exception of " Death To Smoochy " , which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic ) . The dramas he has made lately have been fantastic , especially " Insomnia " and " One Hour Photo " . " The Night Listener " , despite mediocre reviews and a quick DVD release , is among his best work , period . This is a very chilling story , even though it does n't include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter . The concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed . In high school , I read an autobiography by a child named Anthony Godby Johnson , who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted AIDS as a result . I was moved by the story until I read reports online that Johnson may not actually exist . When I saw this movie , the confused feelings that Robin Williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind . Toni Collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic " caretaker " . Her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like " Little Miss Sunshine " . There were even times she looked into the camera where I thought she was staring right at me . It takes a good actress to play that sort of role , and it 's this understated ( yet well reviewed ) role that makes Toni Collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an Academy Award ( as of 2008 ) . It 's incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this , and it 's scary too . This is a good , dark film that I highly recommend . Be prepared to be unsettled , though , because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end .
neg	I have seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest / worst attempts at one . A lot of the scenes work in a plug - and - play manner inserted strictly to conform to the romantic - comedy genre . Usually this is okay because we 're dealing with a genre , but the challenge generally resides in making it original , new and inventive . This movie fails to do so . There is no sense of who the characters really are , apart from Sylvie Moreau 's ( who is the real star of this movie , not Isabelle Blais ) . They fit into this one - dimensional cliché and they become nothing more than simple puppets serving the purpose of a very light narrative . The pacing of the movie can become annoying , rhythm lacks , and the editing is filled with unnecessary close - ups . I should also mention the overly stylized decors making some scenes devoid of any naturally , or rather , making the attempt at naturally seem too obvious . Of course , along with that , you have the right - on - cue sappy music which unfortunately often sounds mismatched . I ca n't believe that a movie who makes obvious Woody Allen allusions ends up being this deceptive . If you expect a good light - hearted romantic comedy , this is not it . Or rather , this a poor attempt at it . You will only leave the theater wondering why this film has been getting such praise when cinema is now more than 100 years old and there are far superior Quebecois directors making better flicks . Les Aimants is a good movie for what it is . But it 's a bad one if you regard cinema as an art and directors as auteur 's .
pos	" Pecker " is a young , unknown photographer from Baltimore who becomes a big star in the public , the media and the local art scene with his pictures showing the dirty reality of all - day life just as dirty underwear or human excrements . It 's a typical topic of John Waters Baltimore - based independent comedies to show the weird sides of the American way of life between political correctness fashion and conservative backlashes by exploring the backgrounds of the middle class society of his hometown . Edward Furlong of " Terminator 2 " fame plays Pecker , supported by Christina Ricchi , photographer Cindy Sherman , legendary Patricia Hearst and Water 's long - time actress Mink Stole . Although the pacing of the plot becomes a big flaw sometimes and ca n't compete with the fast and furious joke attacks of Water 's brilliant " Serial Mom " , it 's still has some good laughs in it and some unforgettable scenes like a former junkie - girl who became a vegetarian by sniffing peas from a vegetable dish ... " Pecker " is a great comedy about the arrogance of the art scene , media hypes , middle - class sex angst and the strange ways of how to become a pop star without realizing it . Recommended !
neg	Wow , the spookiest thing about this episode was the price of houses 40 years ago . I 'll preface by saying I 'm not a fan of narrated episodes . If the story / actors / etc . are worth their salt , they should be able to convey the bulk of the narrative without having to read it out , reminded me of personages who ca n't think off the cuff but rely on teleprompters . The psychobabble was tedious and boring , but some enjoy that kind of thing , it 's just not my cup O tea . They could have kept the narrative but at least made it much more believable and interesting if it was coming from a psychiatrist or maybe a newspaper reporter or something . Niggling little things like Peugeot being at the house , which has a singular half circle driveway , yet he seems to have parked his car in the tree he was standing under , because it 's nowhere to be seen on the road or on the property . Sloppy editing , as she pulls into the driveway ( for what seems the 100th time ) exactly who are those 2 guys you see at 24m30s walking towards the car as she pulls into the driveway of the deserted house ? The dolly close - ups were also overdone , like some Jr. High drama student discovering the zoom function on his camera for the first time . I could keep picking apart , but that might get almost as boring as this episode was . It kept dragging on and the true purpose seemed to be to use absolutely all the stock footage they had shot of Elaine driving the Newport convertible . I fully expected to see the Chrysler logo and a nice jingle play while a voice over told us all about the 8 track player , automatic top etc . The only good thing I have to say about his one is that it just ends , abruptly . No loose ends tied up , nothing explained or terminated . Not that many would notice , I suspect most had already changed the channel or dozed off by the end .
pos	I watched this movie after watching Practical Magic , and the older film was far superior . I liked the way the lighting , makeup , and costumes changed as Gillian changed in the story . Jimmy Stewart 's mannerisms did n't do a lot for me in this film , but I suppose they did serve to highlight the reserve of Gillian 's character . I was also struck by Nicky 's and Gillian 's mannerisms -- it was as if the director wanted him to appear effeminate and Gillian to appear masculine . The gestures Nicky makes when he 's showing Redlich his powers especially struck me . I 've never thought of warlocks as being effeminate , so it was an interesting way of contrasting those characters .
neg	This is only a response to the yahoo who says this movie is more realistic than the classic , genre defining MASTERPIECE , Jaws . Yes , brainiac , great whites(and other species of shark , bull , black - tip , oceanic white - tip , tiger)have been known to populate areas where easy prey is found . Humans do n't often make it onto that menu , granted , but the shark in the film was repeatedly pointed out to be exhibiting abnormal behavior . It 's not like it 's never happened . The odds of a killer whale destroying nearly a whole town , singling out a human nemesis , sinking several dozen thick hulled North Atlantic fishing boats and knowing when certain people , all friends of the aforementioned " nemesis " , are close enough to the water for it to reach , are so slim as to be laughable . Much like this turd of a Jaws knock - off . Laughable . Great white sharks are also known to frequently chew on boats , protective underwater cages and people on rafts and surfboards , as they look like seals from below . A shark the size of Bruce(if you do n't know , look it up)would be more than capable of sinking a boat like The Orca(hey ! that 's the name of the blatant rip - off we 're discussing ! ) , as it would weigh upwards of 6,000 lbs . I could go on , but I do n't need to . Jaws is amazing(better acting , better effects , better music , better writing ) , Orca is crap(BLATANT rip - off of Jaws , lousy writing , abominable effects , most ridiculous plot this side of an Olson Twins flick ) . It does n't take a masters from Columbia University to see that . Watch better movies .
pos	On the face of it a film about women wanting to see a football match would n't appeal much to somebody with little interest in football such as myself however this is n't about football it is about discrimination and the women 's enthusiasm for the sport they love . The film opens on the day of a crucial World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain , a girl is trying to get in to Tehran 's Azadi Stadium by dressing like a boy , it looks like she will get in until a soldier tries to search her . Once caught she is taken to a small enclosure high up on the outside of the stadium where there are a handful of women who had already been caught , here they are guarded by a small group of conscript soldiers who 's leader would rather be back home tending his livestock . We never learn the character 's names but we get to know them as people as the girls plead with the guards to let them watch though a nearby gap in the wall and when refused try to get them to at least provide a commentary . As well as making an important point about the rigid gender segregation in much of present day Iran the film contains many hilarious moments such as the " disguise " one of the girls is made to wear when going to the toilet and the girl who disguised herself as a soldier and was only caught because she chose to watch the match from a seat reserved for a senior officer . The girls enthusiasm for the game is such that by the end the viewer is likely to be on the edge of their seat hoping that Iran will win and thus get to go to the finals in Germany . The soldiers are n't shown as fundamentalists , they are just conscripts who are there because they have to be and when explaining to the girls why woman ca n't watch men 's sports do n't seem that convinced by their own arguments . It is a shame that this film ca n't be seen in Iran itself but it is good that the wider world can see it and thus see that ordinary Iranians are n't a bunch of fanatics desperate to wage war on the west but normal people with the same passions and concerns as people everywhere . The cast did a great job in making their characters seem like real people rather than mere caricatures .
neg	A collection of Deleted scenes and alternative takes , edited together and with added voice - over to make it appear to take place after the events of the first . Pretty cool idea , but deleted scenes are left on the cutting room floor for a reason and this is further proof . As it 's just not as funny as " Anchorman " , and really let 's face it THAT film was n't exactly comedy gold either , so you get a ' movie ' worse than one that was moderately funny . In my eyes that STILL puts it one or two notches above " Kicking and Screaming " , or " Bewitched " . Chross your fingers that " The Wedding Crashers " is a return to old school form ( no pun intended )   My Grade : D
pos	tom had a wish to make film for a long time and he did . it is as if he has visualized a dirty and worn out notebook full of great little ideas he has been filling up and carrying around for 10 years . no grant character transformations , no Hollywood ingredients just life and a little bit of magic . the balance , in speed , in weirdness in comedy vs drama is perfectly weighed . this film takes you on a journey that is over before you realize how nice it was . the music is great and your eyes will be equally satisfied . the fact that this film is about nothing , merely a sequence of sketches of people that are mainly linked trough a party of one of the characters , makes it very pleasant and surprisingly entertaining , it is brilliant because it is empty . in between the lines it is happening . to see or not to see , that 's the ?
neg	I waited for this movie to play in great anticipation . Assuming it would be more accurately portrayed like the movie , " The Christmas Box " based on the book by Richard Paul Evans . I sent out many emails to friends and family asking them to please watch this show , hoping they would better understand a tiny amount of my " new " life . After seeing this movie I was so disappointed . As a mother who lost her only child in November 2003 and REALLY knowing the pain , I had hoped that this movie would shed light to parents who " think " they understand the grief a parent goes through who has lost a child . This movie was a very light hearted movie and the silliness of Diane Keaton was a slap in the face to parents who have buried a child . It was VERY unrealistic from start to stop . I had a few calls after the movie , each call the same , " That was so off the mark and made it appear that in a short time you are back on the road and listening to songs on the radio and life is back " What a bunch of bull ! It is clear that the director and Keaton have never lost a child because neither would have EVER made the movie to be so off the mark . I guess that 's Hollywood .
pos	Was n't quite sure what to expect with this one , outside of the uniform positive reviews I 've read . Turns out , I could have never imagined this movie , because it 's very close to " The Bride with White Hair " in being operatic and dealing with the fantastic . This walks a fine line between being a farce , a comedy , and just plain good old fashion ghost story telling . There 's nothing scary about it , that 's not the theme , it 's really mostly a love story dealing with a bumbling guy who encounters a beautiful ghost , who is in a lot of trouble with other ghosts . So the main theme is the guy trying to save the beautiful ghost . This also takes place in ancient China , with wild outlandish Kung Fu exhibitions , and a trip to hell ( more or less ) . Some of the stop - action ghosts are pretty cool , and the visual effects are top rate all the way . I could watch this genre of Chinese movies all day , because they are highly entertaining , great visuals , and pretty much tongue - in - cheek . And I 'm looking forward to watching the first sequel of this movie also . Highly recommended .
neg	When great director / actor combinations are talked about the team of J. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson is not usually mentioned . Probably because the output of nine joint ventures between the two of them runs the gamut from the really good action entertainment to the mediocre . Unfortunately Kinjite : Forbidden Subjects falls in the latter .   That 's sad because Kinjite could have been a whole lot better . But for the life of me I do n't understand why it was necessary to make the father of the missing Japanese girl , a guy used to getting some cheap jollies because the romance in his marriage has run out . That might have been good for another film altogether , but it served no purpose here . A straightforward cop drama with Charles Bronson as a vice cop who 's seen a bit too much in his line of work and has a strong prejudice against orientals . That part could also have used a little explaining as well . But he 's going to have to overcome it if he and patient partner Perry Lopez are going to locate a captured Japanese school girl . Bronson 's time in the vice squad have told him exactly where to look for the kidnapper . A stylish , murderous pimp played by Jaime Fernandez is the guy and he and Bronson have some history . In fact in the film 's best scene , Bronson made him eat an expensive rolex watch and set his car on fire . At one point Fernandez happens to spot Bronson and Lopez in an all night delicatessen and this being after his rolex snack , he sprays the place with an Uzi killing everyone , but Bronson and Lopez . I really think that little incident would have had more than a couple vice cops from the LAPD after Fernandez . But that 's another terribly big hole in the plot . Still there is a very rough justice in the end for Fernandez . I wish the whole film had been better though . This was the last film of the Bronson - Thompson team and J. Lee Thompson 's last as a director . He should have gone out with something better .

neg	Robert DeNiro plays the most unbelievably intelligent illiterate of all time . This movie is so wasteful of talent , it is truly disgusting . The script is unbelievable . The dialog is unbelievable . Jane Fonda 's character is a caricature of herself , and not a funny one . The movie moves at a snail 's pace , is photographed in an ill - advised manner , and is insufferably preachy . It also plugs in every cliche in the book . Swoozie Kurtz is excellent in a supporting role , but so what ? Equally annoying is this new IMDB rule of requiring ten lines for every review .

pos	The movie " MacArthur " begins and ends at Gen. Douglas MacArthur 's , Gregory Peck , Alma Mata the US Military Academy of West Point on the Hudson . We see a frail 82 year old Gen . MacArthur give the commencement speech to the graduating class of 1962 about what an honor it is to serve their country . The film then goes into an almost two hour long flashback on Gen. MacArthur 's brilliant as well as controversial career that starts in the darkest hours of WWII on the besieged island of Corregidor in the Philippines in the early spring of 1942 . Told to leave he island for Australia before the Japanese military invade it Gen. MacArthur for the very first time in his military career almost disobeys a direct order from his superior US President Franklin D. Roosevelt , Dan O'Herlihy . Feeling that he 'll be deserting his men at their greatest hour of need MacArthur reluctantly , together with his wife and young son , did what he was told only to have it haunt him for the reminder of the war . It was that reason , his escape under fire from death or captivity by the Japanese , that drove Gen. MacArthur to use all his influence to get FDR two years later to launch a major invasion of the Philippians , instead of the island of Formosa , to back up his promise to both the Philippine people as well as the thousands of US POWS left behind . That he 'll return and return with the might of the US Army & Navy to back up his pledge ! In the two years up until the invasion of the Philippine Islands Gen. MacArther battered the Japanese forces in the South Pafific in a number of brilliantly conceived island hop battles that isolated and starved hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops into surrender . The General did that suffering far less US Military losses then any other allied commander in the War in the Pacific !   It was in 1950/51 in the Korean War that Gen. MacArthur achieved his most brilliant victory as well as his worst military defeat . After outflanking the advancing North Korean Army in the brilliant and perfectly executed , with the invading US Marines suffering less then 100 casualties , back door or left hook invasion of Inchon Gen. MacArther feeling invincible sent the US / UN forces under his command to the very border , along the Yalu River , of Communist Red China . Told by his subordinates that he 's facing the threat of a massive ground attack by Communist Chinese troops Gen. MacArthur pressed on anyway until that attack did materialized cutting the US & UN forces to ribbons . The unstoppable wave after wave of attacking Red Chinese troops forced the US / UN forces to retreat in the " Big Bug Out " of 1950 with their very lives , leaving all their equipment behind , across the North Korean border even abandoning the South Korean capital city of Seoul ! This turned out to be one of the biggest military disaster in US history with the US forces losing a record , in the Korean War , 1,000 lives on the very first day - Nov . 29/30 1950-of the Communist Chinese invasion ! Shocked and humiliated in what he allowed , due mostly to his own arrogance , to happened MacArthur went on the offensive not against the advancing Communist Chinese and Noth Koreans forces but his own Commander and Chief Pres . Harry S. Truman , Ed Flanders , in him not having the spin or guts to do what has to be done : Launch a full scale invasion of Communist China with nuclear weapons if necessary to prevent its troops from overrunning the Korean Peninsula ! For Pres . Truman who had taken just about enough garbage from Gen. MacArthur in him running off his mouth in public in how he was mishandling the war in not going all out , like MacArthur wanted him to , against the Red Chinese this was the last straw ! On April 11 , 1951 Pres . Truman unceremoniously relived Gen. MacArthur from his command as Supreme Commander of the US / UN forces in Korea ! Pres . Truman 's brave but very unpopular decision also , by not going along with MacArthur 's total war strategy , prevented a Third World War from breaking out with the Soviet Union - Communist China 's ally- who at the time - like the US - had the Atomic Bomb ! Pres . Truman ' 's controversial decision to dump the very popular Gen. MacArthur also cost him his re - election in 1952 with his polls numbers so low - in the mid 20's- that he withdrew - in March of that year- from the US Presidential Campaign ! In was Gen. MacArthur 's misfortune to be around when the political and military climates in the world were changing in how to conduct future wars . With the horrors of a nuclear war now , in 1950/51 , a reality it would have been national suicide to go all out , like Gen. MacArthur wanted to , against the Red Chinese with it very possibly touching off a nuclear holocaust that would engulf not only the US USSR & Red China but the entire world ! It was that important reality of future war that Gen. MacArthur was never taught , since the A and H Bomb were n't yet invented , in West Point . Back to 1962 we can now see that Gen. MacArthur , after finishing his commencement speech at West Point , had become both an older and wiser soldier as well as , since his retirement from the US Military , elder statesman in his feeling about war and the utter futility of it . One thing that Gen. MacArthur was taught at an early age , from his Civil War General dad Douglas MacArthur Sr , that stuck to him all his life was that to a soldier like himself war should be the very last - not first - resort in settling issues between nations . In that it 's the soldiers who have to fight and die in it . It took a lifetime , with the advent of the nuclear age , for Gen. MacArthur to finally realize just how right and wise his dad a Congressional Medal of Honor winner , like himself , really was !

pos	Night Of The Living Homeless is a funny spoof of the 1978 film(and the 2004 remake ) of " Dawn Of The Dead".Only this time ... with the homeless . The episode has homeless people all coming to South Park and the people can not figure out why . They treat the homeless like zombies who want change and a few of the parents end up on the roof of a supermarket like in the movie . So now it 's up to the boys to find out where they came from and how to get rid of them . This is a fairly funny episode with some good moments like the boys singing their own version of the 2pac / Dr . Dre song " California Love".Overall a good episode . 8/10
neg	Are you kidding me ? ! A show highlighting someone who opens cans and envelopes for a meal ? How talented do you have to be to do this ? She MAY be able to cook but it is NOT portrayed in this half - hour stomach churning painful production . I know she has a Martha - Stewart - esquire empire . So does Warren Buffett but I do n't see him with fake knockers opening cans of cream corn and Alpo . She has a nephew named ... Brycer . Brycer ? Stop talking about anyone a name that stupid . More time is spent on " table - scapes " than actual cooking . Who has that kind of time ? ! Silicon should be on your spatula , not on my TV . This show should be on Cartoon Network , NOT Food Network .
pos	.... after 16 years Tim Burton finally disappoints me ! ! ! ! Whatever happened to the old Burton who read " The Dark Knight Returns " by Frank Miller as research for his preparation to direct Batman back in 1988 - 89 ? By the looks of it Burton did n't research the book nor the movie cause he got everything WRONG ! This movie sucks ! It 's not as good as the original and it does n't deal with the same subject as the original . If you want a good ape movie watch the original . * * out of****stars
neg	When I saw the preview , I thought : this is going to be a great movie . And indeed it could have been . The actress playing the main character was very credible , and the beauty of the filming is undeniable . However the dialogues cast a dark shadow on the whole picture . The level of language was too familiar and too contemporary for an action taking place in 1610 , and it took away most of the magic of the film . However , I must congratulate the translator , because the English sub - titles were more refined and appropriate that the original French cues , and it probably explains the good rating the movie received on the imbd !
pos	This is a film i decided to go and see because I 'm a huge fan of adult animation . I quite often find that when a film does n't evolve around a famous actor or actress but rather a story or style , it allows the film to be viewed as a piece of art rather than a showcase of the actors ability to differ his styles . This film is certainly more about style than story . While i found the story interesting ( a thriller that borrows story and atmosphere from films such as Blade Runner and many anime films ) , it was a bit hard to follow at times , and did n't feel like it all came together as well as it could have . It definitely had a mixed sense of French Animation and Japanese Anime coming together . Whether that s a good thing or not is up to the viewer . Visually this film is a treat for the eyes , and in that sense a work of art . If you like adult animation , or would like to see a film that is different from most films out at the moment . I would recommend it . All i can say is that i enjoyed the experience of the film but did come away slightly disappointed because it could have been better
neg	Movie had some good acting and good moments ( though obviously pretty low budget ) , but bad rating due to basic premise being badly developed . The main point of conflict between the two leads does n't play out in a realistic manner at all . There are a few scenes where they disagree because of it , but no discussions of any great depth that would explain how they can be together while seeing the world so differently , especially since the employment of Glenn is so wound up in this part of his life ( and Adam is active enough with his that he supports it with time and money . ) Also , several times Glenn is portrayed negatively for being the way he is ( apologizing to Adam for his past ) while Adam is shown to be upstanding and " traditional , " which the film proclaims to be the " good " way in the end . I do n't like being preached to like that . I attended a discussion session with the director after viewing LTR , and he said that he presented this conflict between them because , if he was in Glenn 's shoes ( and he said he does in real life relate to Glenn 's view ) that he could never date someone with Adam 's views . Well , then , I think he should have done a much better job explaining how Glenn could do it in the film . Also , director said he directed this , his first movie , only after reading ( Directing For Dummies . ) Directing was not that bad , but far from a top notch effort . I 've seen worse , but I rarely leave films feeling this frustrated .
pos	Do n't believe all of the negative reviews this movie receives . Yes , it is cheaply made . Yes , the gore is laughable . And , yes , the acting is sub - par . However , this is a textbook example of an early slasher flick , and if that is your " thing " ( its mine ! ) then you will enjoy this one . There are enough good aspects to this movie to more than compensate for the drawbacks . For one , the score by a then unknown Christopher Young is very creepy and accents the violence perfectly . The ending is a welcomed break from the predictable upbeat endings of most movies . And last , but not least , the setting is what made the film for me . The makers of this film could have done a much better job " dressing " the set to make it more believable as a college dorm . However , if you can overlook this flaw , the setting is great . Four collegiates all alone in a huge , abandoned , condemned building just waiting to be torn down .... it reaks of possibility . When watching , allow your imagination to do some of the work and you may enjoy this film as much as I did .
neg	This is the worst movie I 've ever seen in my life . This is saying quite a bit , considering some of the choices I 've made in film rentals . I got this on netflix based entirely on the fact that someone I went to high school with is topless in it . The topless scene lasted all of about 5 seconds and the rest of the movie was about as much fun as having pungee sticks driven underneath my toenails whilst being forced to listen to Roseanne sing Big Spender . The " skits " are stupid and consist of the worst kind of juvenile bathroom humor and locker - room gags , and it 's such a blatant ( and poor ) rip - off of The Kentucky Fried Movie that you 'll be begging for Big Jim Slade to crash through the wall and save us from the stupidity of " Vince Offer " ( whoever that is ) . Unless you are a masochist , avoid this pile of rubbish .
pos	As a forty - something urban explorer / photography and longtime fan of the original Kolchak : Night Stalker series since my early childhood , one aspect that has n't really been mentioned is the amount of urban exploration Carl 's character undertook during the series . He always managed to get himself in to one great abandonment , sewer or tunnel after another . Armed with only his trusty penlight ( okay , so he had some flares in the primal ape episode tunnel ) and his camera , he never carried any other gear to either protect himself or make the exploration easier . Like many here , I recently purchased the DVD box set of the two pilot movies and subsequent TV episodes , and have been slowly revisiting all the shows . And although I remember watching them back in the early 70s when they first aired , its been over 30 years passed ... so many of them seem new all over again . Campy , dated and cheesy - but charming and highly entertaining . They just do n't make stuff like this these days . Now its all regurgitated spin - offs with predictable characters and plots . Thankfully , my 16-yr - old daughter has been sitting down to watch the episodes with me and has developed an appreciation for them ( she enjoys the genre ) . It gives me hope and faith the series will carry on to new generations of fans for years to come .
neg	" Scary Movie 2 " is a let down to the Scary Movie Franchise . Scary Movie 1 , 3 and 4 were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny . Luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great Scary Movies . This film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their Professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night . Things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape . This movie is n't horrible but they could have improved quite a few things . It is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the Scary Movie franchise then give this a watch - but I do n't think you will like it nearly as much .
pos	Two dysfunctional brothers ( Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke ) get tired of competing for who is the bigger f***-up and who Daddy ( Albert Finney ) loves more , so they hatch a hair - brained scheme to rob Mommy and Daddy 's jewelry store so that they can clear their debts and start fresh . Sounds like a great plan except that this is a suspenseful 1970 's style melodrama about a heist gone wrong , and boy , do things really go wrong here for our hapless duo and everyone involved . Lasciviously concocted by screenwriter Kelly Masterson and classically executed by director Sidney Lumet , " Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead " uses the heist as its McGuffin to delve deep into family drama . Contrary to popular belief , Sidney Lumet is not dead . At age 83 , he has apparently made a deal with the Devil to deliver one last great film . Lumet was at his zenith in the 1970 's with films like " Dog Day Afternoon , " " Serpico , " and one of my favorite films of all time , " Network " . He has somehow managed to make a film that bears all the hallmarks of his classics while intertwining some more modern elements ( graphic sexuality , violence , and playing with time - frames and POV 's ) into a crackling , vibrant , lean , mean , and provocative melodrama . One can only hope that some of the modern greats ( like Scorsese or Spielberg ) who emerged during the same decade Lumet was at the top of his game will have this much chutzpah left when they reach that age . Lumet is a master at directing people walking through spaces to create tension and develop characters . As the cast waltzes through finely appointed Manhattan offices and apartments his slowly moving camera creates a palpable sense of anxiety as we never know who might be around the next corner or what this person might do in the next room . Also amazing is how Lumet utilizes the multiple POV and shifting time - frame approach . The coherent and classical presentation he uses makes the similarly structured films of wunderkinds Christopher Nolan and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu seem like amateur hour . Of course , what Lumet is best at is directing amazing ensemble casts and tricking them into acting within an inch of their lives . Philip Seymour Hoffman has never been , and most likely never will be , better than he is here . Albert Finney 's quietly searing portrayal of a father betrayed and at the end of his rope is a masterpiece to watch unfold . Ethan Hawke , normally a nondescript pretty boy , is perfect as the emotionally crippled younger brother who has skated by far too long on his charms and looks . The coup - de - grace , however , is the series of scenes between Hoffman and Marisa Tomei , eerily on point as his flighty trophy wife . Lumet runs them through the gamut of emotions that culminate in a scene that is the best of its kind since William Holden taunted Beatrice Straight right into a Best Supporting Actress Oscar in " Network . "   The Devil of any great film is in the details , from Albert Finney 's tap of his car 's trunk that wo n't close due to a fender bender , to the look Amy Ryan ( fresh off her amazing turn in " Gone Baby Gone " ) gives her ex - husband Ethan Hawke at his mawkish promise to his little girl all three of them knows he wo n't keep , to the systematic unraveling of a family on the skids , to the dialog begging for cultists to quote it ( my favorite line being the hilariously threatening " Do you mind if I call you Chico ? " ) to the excellent Carter Burwell score . " Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead " is the film of the year . If something emerges to best it , then we know a few other deals must 've been brokered with Old Scratch .
neg	I was sadly disappointed by this film due to the fact that it felt false and the characters were not strong enough to carry the films pretty weak attempt at horror . The basic idea for the film was interesting but unfortunately it was n't able to excite , really scare or shock me - there was one part in the entire film that I thought was gruesome but even that did n't redeem it . I did get to like the character of Kate by the end of the film as she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end , the character played by Jeremy Sheffield was not actually needed for this film and I think the director / writer got carried away with the myriad of characters used for no purpose , if he had left it at the basic characters making it more of a solo effort on Kate 's part , it may have worked - Jeremy 's acting was wooden to say the least and I felt uncomfortable watching the bad on screen chemistry - or lack of it . Such a shame . Disappointing .
pos	It was originally meant to be a film that Gene Kelly would star in , but when the makers could n't get him they got " the greatest actor in the world " , and the result is pretty good . Basically Nathan Detroit ( Frank Sinatra ) is having trouble doing what he does best , setting up a high stakes crap dice game , because he needs $ 1000 to get the place . So to get the money he needs , he has a $ 1000 bet with old friend Sky Masterson ( Marlon Brando ) that he ca n't get Sergeant Sarah Brown ( Great Expectations ' Golden Globe winning , and BAFTA nominated Jean Simmons ) to go with him to Havana . Meanwhile , Nathan is having trouble trying to get rid of the woman who wants him to ask her hand in marriage , Miss Adelaide ( Vivian Blaine ) . Also starring Robert Keith as Lieutenant Brannigan , Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely Johnson and B.S. Pulley as Big Jule . An interesting romantic comedy musical , with Brando singing all his own songs , and Sinatra being smooth and cool . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction - Set Decoration , Best Cinematography , Best Costume Design and Best Music for Jay Blackton and Cyril J. Mockridge , it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source , and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical / Comedy . Frank Sinatra was number 43 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons , Marlon Brando was number 30 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , he was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols , he was number 4 on 100 Years , 100 Stars - Men , Sinatra was number 35 , and Brando was number 1 on The World 's Greatest Actor , " Luck Be a Lady " was number 42 on 100 Years , 100 Songs for , the film was number 23 on 100 Years of Musicals , and it was number 36 on The 100 Greatest Musicals . Very good !
neg	An uptight voyeur who wants to commit suicide encounters a free spirited bad - seed who has 5 weeks to live and then they 're off to discover America . Get the idea ? There 's not an original moment in this whole movie .
pos	I watched this film a few times in the 90 's and nearly split my sides laughing each time . I love Eddie Murphy as an actor , but this stand up is some thing else . He is SO funny . Even the P.C. brigade would find this hilarious . It 's a must watch , and even better if you 've got the guys or girls in for a drink . The take off of Michael Jackson is so like him , if you close your eyes you believe it 's him singing . The things he describes are true to life and you would seriously have to have a humour bypass if you thought this was not funny . My local video stores do not stock this video any more but I would love to get my hands on a copy to show my husband and boys when they are old enough to appreciate the humour . Anyway , highly recommended , hope you enjoy .
neg	Billed as a kind of sequel to The Full Monty , about unemployed men in Sheffield , this movie is a fake . As someone born in Sheffield , and still with links to the city , I was extremely disappointed by this film . Someone said it could have been set in Oklahoma , and that just about sums it up for me . This looked like a romantic view of northern England made for the US market . Probably many Americans - and many southern English people - do n't realize that Sheffield is a big city of around half a million inhabitants , with a sophisticated urban culture . In Among Giants it was depicted as some dreary dead - end semi - rural small town , where everyone in Sheffield seemed to drink in the same old - fashioned pub , and where the people 's idea of a party was line - dancing in some village - hall lookalike . This was a small close - knit community , not a metropolitan city . The working - class Sheffield men were totally unlike their real - life counterparts , who are generally taciturn and communicate with each other in grunts and brief dry remarks . They do n't chatter , and they certainly do n't sing in choirs . Even the rural settings , supposedly in the Peak District , looked alien to me . I recognized a few places where I used to go hiking , but some of the aerial shots of pylons stretching out over a bleak landscape reminded me more of Wales . Indeed , in the credits at the end I spotted a reference to Gwynedd , Wales . The Peak District is , in the summer , crawling with walkers and tourists in cars . It is situated between two big cities . It is not some kind of wilderness . As for the notion that a young woman could fall in love with , and lust after , Pete Postlethwaite , that was ludicrous , and could only have been a male dream . Her reasons for becoming his lover were never made apparent . None of the men was shown as having a partner or families ; they existed in a vacuum . Anyone wanting to see a film about unemployed Sheffielders would have been led astray . This Sheffield existed only in the minds of its middle - class writers and film - makers . It was a gigantic fake !
pos	A very silly movie , this starts with a soft porn sequence , ventures into farcelike comedy in the art gallery , adds a shocker of a discovery in the hotel room then introduces a random murder for no obvious reason . What follows is bizarre and surreal ( the stopwatch scene in particular is exquisitely unnecessary ) , culminating in a revelatory " twist " ending which is as obvious as it is unfair on the viewer ( see the trivia section for precisely why it 's deliberately unfair ) . The movie goes out of its way to be offensive to as many groups as possible - transsexuals , the insane , and the wonderful " Huggie Bear "- style racial stereotyping on the subway - and condescendingly treats the viewer like an idiot in the closing scenes , as characters endlessly explain to one another in great detail and over and over again what just happened in the film . Though the background female characters in the restaurant scene at the end are a joy to watch . In fact , the whole movie is a joy to watch : Despite its many , many flaws , the whole package just , well , works .
neg	ok . for starters , taxi driver is amazing . this , this is not taxi driver or amazing . what it is is bad . but i thought it was bad funny , which means that it did have some redeeming qualities . like the dialogue ... wow . there was more or less no plot , the characters were all stupid , and the movie was preachy . there were some places were i thought the movie would dive into taxi driver type violence , which would have hit the message at the end of the movie on the head much harder . i ca n't even believe that there are like 20 other people who have seen this movie . yeah , it 's worth watching if you are real bored and you want to reaffirm the fact that anyone can make a movie , or at least can try to .
pos	Time For A Hit ! Waqt Dir- Vipul Amrutlal Shah Cast- Amitabh Bachchan , Akshay Kumar , Priyanka Chopra , Shefali Shah , Rajpal Yadav and Boman Irani . Written by- Aatish Kapadia Rating- * * * Eureka ! We 've got it ! Yes , ladies and gentlemen  in Vipul Shah 's ' Waqt ' , we have probably found this year 's first bona fide hit . Replete with all the necessary ingredients of a commercial Bollywood fare , ' Waqt ' has all that it takes for a movie to click with the Indian audiences . It 's the kinda film that makes a distributor feel happy and contemplate his next phoren visit ! In this ' saga of Indian emotions ' then , we have a happy family(isn't it always ? ) of three . Ishwar(Amitabh Bachchan ) , the postman - turned - millionaire(don't ask how! ... there 's something about selling toys while delivering letters and all that  seriously- who gives a damn ! ) , married to Sumi(Shefali Shah ) is a doting father to Aditya(Akshay Kumar ) . Ishwar has to make a serious decision about his son 's careless attitude towards the responsibilities of life . His love for Aditya though , results in his procrastination of the grave issue . However , when faced with a situation that will test his race against time , Ishwar has no alternative but to throw Aditya out of the house- hoping that the new predicament might make him more conscientious of his own life . But this presumed solution becomes a problem in itself , as the rift between the loving father - son increases and the fences continue to grow .   You do n't have to be a rocket - scientist to realize that such a story provides ample opportunities to infuse comedy and drama alike . So , pre - interval you have the initially funny , later annoying comedy track of Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav ; and post - interval there are the go for your kerchief moments between Aby and Akki ! Writer Aatish Kapadia(he also penned the original Gujarati play ' Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu ' on which the film is based ) does a good job of keeping the narrative fluid . The dialogues tend to get inconsistent at times . It does n't help that songs appear like acne on a teenage face and mar the proceedings . Clearly , a couple of numbers could 've been done away with . On the directing front , Vipul shows that he possesses a natural flair for story - telling . ' Waqt ' , as well as his earlier debut effort ' Aankhen ' , manage to keep you interested till the last reel . On a personal note- the seesaw of emotions was a tad jerky for me . But gauging from the audience reactions , it was working to the hilt . Finally , ' Waqt ' is all about its performances which amount to one whole point in the overall rating ! Amitabh Bachchan is dependable as always . His energy is visible and so is his age ! Shefali pitches in a finely nuanced performance and matches the superstar at every step . Boman and Rajpal bring the house down with their histrionics . Priyanka has little to do than fulfill the perfunctory role of a heroine . When it all boils down though , ' Waqt ' is Akshay 's vehicle . I have always maintained that Akki is as good as the role suits him . Put him in a ' Mujhse Shaadi Karogi ' and he 's fantastic , but in a ' Bewafaa ' he is woefully bad . Here , Akki is probably at his best . Whether it is his comic timing or his emotional renderings , he is near - perfect . There 's also an action scene for his fans ! Ironically , his previous best endeavour was in ' Aankhen'- with the same director and Big B at his side ! ' Waqt ' is by no means a memorable movie . It 's not one that will feature in the better films of our industry . But it is one for the masses . And at a time when the industry is waiting desperately for a universal hit , ' Waqt ' might just do the trick ! - Abhishek Bandekar Trivia- This is Akshay Kumar 's second consecutive film after ' Bewafaa ' , in which he performs on stage during the climax !

neg	This movie is a great example of how even some very funny jokes can go terribly wrong . i really expected at least something from this movie after seeing the add which was funny as hell but the movie was n't half as good . The weird part is that the jokes are actually funny , the spoofs of the smoking ban , Jo Bole ... etc . are genuinely good jokes but i do n't know whom to blame this movie flop on . The prime candidates may be:- 1 ) The hammers ( actors ) and hammeresses ( actresses ) and not even the funny kind 2 ) The director 3)The guy who cast the actors and/or the director Anyway if you are really really bored and i mean really see this movie , or else get a copy of each and every ad or teaser of this movie and laugh your butt of because those will be far funnier than the film . p.s the only saving grace of this film is mahesh manjrekar and the funny chappu bhai
pos	This movie really is a mixed bag . On the one hand , the story and concept of the movie are really good , tense and have some nice plot twists in it . But than again on the other hand , it all is told very slow , without style and uninvolved . Still I regard " Just Cause " as an above average thriller simply because of the fine cast . Maybe Sean Connery was miscast in his role . I mean , he is n't really that believable as a the main ' hero ' and father of a young daughter ( played by a still very young Scarlett Johansson by the way ) and husband of Kate Capshaw . I feel that he simply was too old for the role to be really credible in it . However Sean Connerey is of course a great actor and that is the only reason why he is still able to carry the movie as good as he does . But he of course is helped by a very solid supporting cast that consists out of actors like Laurence Fishburne , Blair Underwood , Ned Beatty , Hope Lange , Lynne Thigpen and Ed Harris . All actors are really good but some of them are highly underused at the same time , which is a real shame , as well as a missed opportunity . Especially Ed Harris is just totally great in his role as a psychopathic serial killer . He 's truly chilling and acting superbly . Normally he does n't play this ruthless , chilling sort of roles in movies , so he really surprises with his role in this one . His performance alone is already more than enough reason to watch this movie . However due to the fact that the story is told without much style and too formulaic , none of the characters in the movie really work out well because it feels all too distant . It really is the way of storytelling that kills all the movie its fine potential . Arne Glimcher directs the movie with little style and keeps the pace too low at times . Because of this , we as viewers , never really get involved with the story or any of it 's characters . It really is too bad , for " Just Cause " had more than enough potential . A fine cast and a slick story with some unexpected twists and turns in it in which nothing is what it seems . The cast and story are the only reason why this movie is still an above average thriller , that will probably still please the fan of the genre . It however is an eternal shame that the movie is lacking in its story telling and style , or else this movie could had been a real classic in its genre . 7/10
neg	Terrible film with Frank Sinatra as Tony Rome . Here , he gets involved with a dead woman below the sea . Rome is soon hired to find out what happened to a woman . Naturally , it 's the woman below the sea . Her room mate , Lainie Kazan , soon winds up dead on the floor . An aging Richard Conte plays a police officer and friend of Rome . When a local club owner gets killed , the blame falls on Rome and there becomes an interesting chase scene . That 's how bad this picture is if you have to depend on a chase scene to supply the action . Raquel Welch plays the beauty up to her neck in intrigue . Her acting leads a lot to be desired .   Martin Gabel is a retired hoodlum whose son is trying to outdo him . By the film 's end , you do n't know why the girl was murdered . Do n't even bother to ask .
pos	And this is a great rock'n'roll movie in itself . No matter how it evolved ( at point being a movie about disco ) , it ended up as one of the ultimate movies in which kids want to rock out , but the principal stands in their way . Think back to those rock'n'roll movies of the 50 's in which the day is saved when Alan Freed comes to town with Chuck Berry to prove that Rock & Roll Music is really cool and safe for the kids , and Tuesday Weld gets a new sweater for the dance . Forward to the 1979 , repeat the same plot , but throw in DA RAMONES , whom no one then realized would become one of the most influential bands of the next quarter century ( and then for the obligatory DJ guest shot , " The Real " Don Steele ) . Throw in , too , all the elements of a Roger Corman - produced comedy - exploitation film , except for the two - day shooting schedule , some of the familiar Corman repertory players like Clint Howard , Mary Wournow and Dick Miller ( there since " Bucket of Blood " ) , and you 've got one of the great stoopid movies of the day . One of the few films that uses deliberate cheesiness and gets away with it . I showed the new DVD to a friend who could only remember seeing parts of it through a stoner- induced haze at the drive - in , and he agreed that this is one of the great movies to be watching drunk , not the least for the lovely leading ladies and the great Ramones footage .
neg	This movie stinks ! You will want back the two - plus hours it takes to get through it . Sliding Doors , w/ Gwyenth Paltrow and directed by Peter Howit , did what Melinda & Melinda tries to do much much MUCH better . That movie was clever , witty , and well - acted . I cared about what happened to both Gwyenths -- or rather the characters she played -- and the performances by supporting cast were fantastic . Where as Melinda & Melinda is tiresome , the dialogue is contrived and I could have cared less about any of these people -- least of all Melinda . One Melinda is so dysfunctional -- her first glass of wine is at 10 a.m. -- and so melodramatic she is laughable , and not in the comedic sense . The 2nd Melinda is fine , but forgettable . Woody Allen 's previous ensemble movies worked because , I 'm guessing , he spent time on the screenplay and the actors were talented . One piece of trivia for this movie is that he wrote this screenplay in two months : you can tell . And while Chloe Sevigny is talented -- those around her are not , not enough to be a whole presence . The movie ends up being Chloe Sevigny and a bunch of other people you know you 've seen in other movies but ca n't quite remember which ones . Sad , very sad .
pos	One reason Pixar has endured so well , and been so successful , is that while their films remain technical marvels and visual mosaics , they have a story to match their style . And often very moving style at that : affecting , charming and cross - generational . That a lot Anime ( speaking in broad terms ) and a great many other animations fail to match their technical virtuosity with real substance is , I think ( and I might be wrong ) partly because either the makers are n't bothered with character and plot and focus far too much on sound and image , or the sheer effort that goes into making some animations is so enormous , so enervating that they do n't have the energy to create a really engaging story . That same can not be said of Renaissance . There are flaws in its plot , but I 'll get to that later . Those same flaws , however , are not reflected in the visuals - Renaissance is nowt short of stunning . The ultra - high contrast images ( sometimes so high - contrast that is nothing but one face or one beam of light visible ) and incredible detail are always impressive , always a joy to behold . The futuristic Paris on display is the grim offspring of Blade Runner and Brave New World ; dark , murky , quite affluent and even clean , but shrouded in intrigue , corporate malfeasance , obsessed with beauty ( capital of the catwalk , after all ) and disguising the squalor and neglect of its labyrinthine passages with a veneer of monumental , sophisticated architecture . It 's a compelling environment , not entirely original , but great all the same . The film 's much - touted ' motion - capture ' technology and incredible attention to human and design minutiae result in images a black - and - white photographer would die for . Not that the detail prevents entertainment , because Christian Volckman crafts some superb action sequences : a hell - for - leather care chase , a couple of gruesome(ly imaginative ) murders , several tussles in the dark and a nasty dust - up in a gloomy apartment . The locations are great , too ( I want to visit the nightclub ) . While the central character of Karas is your regular off - the - shelf maverick cop , the other two female characters ( who are sisters ) are the real motors of the movie . Coming from war - torn Eastern Europe , products of a war , diaspora and a family spat , they 're a compelling metaphor for Europe as a whole . The film is tremendously atmospheric , its dizzying , swooping faux - camera moves and adult tone making for a very engaging experience . However , the plot ... It never becomes more interesting than the initial hook , in which indefatigable plod Karas must find Ilona Tasuiev , a drop - dead gorgeous and pioneering scientist , after she 's snatched from the street . The sinister corporation Avalon ( is ANY corporation ever not sinister ? ) , which she was working for on ' classified ' , projects are hell - bent on her retrieval , and soon Karas is up to his neck in official reprimands , dead bodies , cigarette - smoke and narrowly - missed bullets , and falling in love with Ilona 's sister Bislane ( very sympathetically voiced by Catherine McCormack ) , as he plumbs the depths of the city 's sordid underbelly ( and his own past ) . Text - book noir , in other words , but while I enjoyed the film a lot more than Sin City ( to which it bears a passing visual resemblance ) , the plot and resolution are dull , the theme of immortality being raised but never examined , and the shenanigans of high - rolling Avalon CEO Paul Dellenbach are also dull , undercutting a lot of the dramatic tension . The basic ideas are familiar sci - fi genre materials , and there 's a nagging sense that the visuals and atmosphere are disguising the mundane material . However , the film as a whole is lucid and perfectly coherent , even if some of the scenarios the characters get into occasionally feel like excuses for displays of technical wizardry . But it 's the projection of life in Paris circa 2054 , the vision of community and creation of another city from the ground up that makes this film something to behold . I may be taking it too seriously , and if that 's the case I can at least say that it 's superbly made , extremely entertaining ( and pretty mature , too ) , and with an ambiance like no other .
neg	I wanted to like this film , I really did . It 's got some good actors but ultimately it falls flat . It tries too hard to be funny in some places ( the daughters over zealous cooking attempts ) , over reaches in others ( the scene where they clean up someone 's yard , so he agrees to join the team ) and has some scenes that , while mildly interesting , are really just filler ( all the work scene 's ) . And I did n't find the " villians " intimidating , or worth hating , so much as I found them to be childishly annoying .   I 've met people like those in the film while playing church ball . And I will say the referee 's are spot on , Still , in the end , I really did n't care all that much about the characters , or their quest for church ball glory . Maybe because they were all so one dimensional , which I might not have minded so much if the film were funnier or seemed to flow a little more smoothly overall .   Kurt Hale , and Halestorm entertainment , has made some good films , but this is not one of them .
pos	I caught this on the dish last night . I liked the movie . I traveled to Russia 3 different times ( adopting our 2 kids ) . I ca n't put my finger on exactly why I liked this movie other than seeing " bad " turn " good " and " good " turn " semi - bad " . I liked the look Ben Chaplin has through the whole movie . Like " I ca n't belive this is happening to me " whether it 's good or bad it the same look ( and it works ) . Great ending . 7/10 . Rent it or catch it on the dish like I did .
neg	Ritchie 's first two films were snappy , stylish entertainment . Here , he raids two recent classics  ' The Usual Suspects ' and ' Fight Club '  and still comes out empty - handed . Despite parading itself as a con - mystery ( with the sub-'Usual Suspects ' twaddle " the greatest con he ever pulled was convincing you that he was you " or whatever it was ... ) and attempting a ' Fight - Club ' twist about which characters are real and which are internal manifestations , the film struggles to maintain interest in its second half . By the last third , you know you 're being lead down a blind alley , and tediously slowly at that . Cons , chess and game theory are all great subjects , but Ritchie delves into them too superficially and too repetitively to make much use of the material . The only thing that keeps the movie ( almost ) watchable is Ritchie 's bold way with with a scene and Maurice - Jones 's dynamic camera . If Ritchie stuck to a more satisfying plot , and succumbed to tighter editing , there 's no reason why he could n't have made another enjoyable gangster caper . As it is , Revolver is a waste of your time . Incomprehensibility does not equal profundity . If you want to see a great film that does n't make logical sense but makes a virtue of it ( and , incidentally , which also involves an inexplicable escape from solitary confinement ) watch ' Lost Highway ' .
pos	As a knowledgeable fan I recommend this film as faithful to the facts and well acted . As an 11 year old living in Istanbul I heard some friends talking about a new music sensation that caused girls to scream . I thought hmmmm , if girls like them , they must be crap . My only records until then were Haley Mills , The Everly Brothers & Ricky Nelson . Soon after while on vacation with the family at a military cafeteria in Ismir I heard a song ( which I later learned was ' Love Me Do ' ) and was floored by the difference between it and every song I had ever heard until then . When I heard the ' Meet The Beatles ' album of my older brother I was hooked for life . Having read the definitive book of their beginnings ( by Davis ) I was surprised that this movie followed the facts very well with the exception of leaving out most of the sex and some of the drug use ( it did touch on the use of methadrine / dexadrine ) . >
neg	I really love the sexy action and sci - fi films of the sixties and its because of the actress 's that appeared in them . They found the sexiest women to be in these films and it did n't matter if they could act ( Remember " Candy " ? ) . The reason I was disappointed by this film was because it was n't nostalgic enough . The story here has a European sci - fi film called " Dragonfly " being made and the director is fired . So the producers decide to let a young aspiring filmmaker ( Jeremy Davies ) to complete the picture . They 're is one real beautiful woman in the film who plays Dragonfly but she 's barely in it . Film is written and directed by Roman Coppola who uses some of his fathers exploits from his early days and puts it into the script . I wish the film could have been an homage to those early films . They could have lots of cameos by actors who appeared in them . There is one actor in this film who was popular from the sixties and its John Phillip Law ( Barbarella ) . Gerard Depardieu , Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockwell appear as well . I guess I 'm going to have to continue waiting for a director to make a good homage to the films of the sixties . If any are reading this , " Make it as sexy as you can " ! I 'll be waiting !
pos	This is one of the best of the series , ranking up there with Resident Evil 3 : Nemesis ( Or Biohazard : Last Escape ) The game has a very good storyline in which you play as Claire Redfield in the search for her brother , Chris Redfield ( Whom you probably know from the original Resident Evil ) It is as scary as the other Resident Evil , and contains alot more cutscenes . My Rating : * * * * out of * * * * * Stars ( Rating based on comparison to other videogames )
neg	this movie had a lot of blood in it when the sabretooth attack it also i loved it when that guy and the women were having some good time and then the sabretooth attacked the women and ate her stomach and took the liver out . that was the best and the 1ton sabretooth walking on its front legs hilarious to make this movie better more action and less talking if you know what i mean and also please please people who made this movie do n't make anothwer movie like this movies ending cause it was terrible 1 sabretooth alive and killed that women in the end this movie reminds me of the grudges ending always there 's 1 enemy left ! OK damn it this movie sucks i can ' t believe it i loved it when my lil bro got freaked from the attacks stomach takin out and the blood ya
pos	Highly recommended ! ! A well written , funny film which will appeal to everyone out there with a sense of humour!!!. Give it a go , it 's good to see an Independent British Movie more than holding it 's own against the big established studios ! ! Definitely worth adding to any film collection . There are scenes in this film that I 'm sure a lot of people will be able to relate to . You will laugh out loud at the antics and enjoy the great soundtrack . I especially enjoyed the Orb 's version of Jimmy Cliff 's Vietnam and The Tower of London 's take on Freebird .   Go on give it a go ............ you wo n't be disappointed .
neg	I 've always thought that most huge box - office flops usually have something to recommend them , but after the remake of Around the World in 80 Days and Thunderbirds , I 'm beginning to doubt it . For those not familiar , it 's based on a puppet show about a family of astronauts who use state of the art rockets , spaceships and subs to rescue people from various disasters ( falling bridges , stricken planes , burning buildings , etc ) each week . Well , the puppets are gone ( replaced by far more lifeless teenagers ) , and so is the premise - only one ineptly staged rescue and a plot shamelessly ripped off from Spy Kids without any signs of imagination , wit or entertainment . Young Alan Tracey feels left out of all the rescuing we never see the other Traceys do because dad wo n't let him play with a real rocket until he passes his exams . Grounded on a beautiful tropical island ( some punishment ! ) , his chance to shine comes when the rest of the family - a bunch of identikit bleach - blondes who look like a gay neo - Nazi boy band without a single bit of characterisation between them - are stranded in space and he has to have the day by , er , running around the jungle , making a phone call , firing a hose at the inept comedy relief villains and dousing them in gunk for bad measure . The good points are few and far between . One of them is that the film is mostly in focus . The other is they all got to go to the Seychelles , which looks nice . The bad points : where to start ? Ben Kingsley 's career lowpoint performance ? The aforementioned inept comedy relief sidekicks who would disgrace the Children 's Film Foundation at its worst ? The almost complete lack of action or effects in a $ 70 m sci - fi film ? The terrible script , the lifeless direction , the odious moralising ? But most of all is the fact that the film is so patronising in every possible way . Forget the life lessons and off the peg sentiment , this is a movie aimed straight at the under - eights by people who know they 're making a kid 's movie and are constantly talking down to their intended audience , throwing in fifth - rate jokes and routines that would insult most children who had only recently mastered the art of speech . This film could replace being sent to bed early without their dinner as parents ' favourite punishment for kids . The biggest flop in British film history ( it did n't even cover the cost of prints and marketing ) , it 's just about watchable if only as an object lesson in how NOT to make a summer movie .
pos	Michael Is King . This film contains some of the best stuff Mike has ever done . Smooth Criminal is pure genius . The cameos are wonderful , but as always , the main event is MJ himself . He is the best , hands down .
neg	A patient escapes from a mental hospital , killing one of his keepers and then a University professor after he makes his way to the local college . Next semester , the late prof 's replacement and a new group of students have to deal with a new batch of killings . The dialogue is so clichéd it is hard to believe that I was able to predict lines in quotes . This is one of those cheap movies that was thrown together in the middle of the slasher era of the ' 80 's . Despite killing the heroine off , this is just substandard junk . Horrible acting , horrible script , horrible effects , horrible horrible horrible ! ! " Splatter University " is just gunk to put in your VCR when you have nothing better to do , although I suggest watching your head cleaner tape , that would be more entertaining . Skip it and rent " Girl 's Nite Out " instead . Rated R for Strong Graphic Violence , Profanity , Brief Nudity and Sexual Situations .
pos	I got to see this just this last Friday at the Los Angeles film festival at Laemlee 's on Beverly . This movie got the most applause of all the films that evening . Considering that two music videos opened first , I did n't know what to expect since they were very fast and attention grabbing , I was n't sure I was ready for a short immediately . But to my surprise I really enjoyed this . I thought the main actor demon guy was really good . I was so impressed with his performance that I checked out his name . I was surprised to see that this was the Witchblade guy . He 's gotten really good especially since then ! Either that or he was given lousy roles or had been pushed by the director really hard for this short . The girl did an okay job . I guess its hard since it was her first performance and being so young . The dad did well also . There was a lot of really nice cg work for a short , both for this and the short playing next " Mexican Hat " which was also nice , but I enjoyed this the most because it had the most depth and emotion and I actually cared about the characters . The other was a very simple story . The story was quite illustrative and dark ! It dealt with real topics using a more fantasy like approach to keep ADD people like me interested . We wo n't even talk about the last film in the block which I left . My only complaint is that I only wish I had seen more of the demon character and a little less of getting started , which is why I gave it a 9 out of 10 . I also thought the end credits went a little slowly . Otherwise it was beautifully told , directed and edited . The timing was very nice with a complete change from the fast MTV editing done on everything nowadays . There will be more coming from this director in the future as well as the actor . I now will think of him as the Sorrows Lost actor not the Witchblade guy .
neg	First I liked that movie . It seemed to me a nice comedy with some silly moments . The costume designer Albert Wolsky did his best ! ! ! The same as wonderful set decorator Robert R. Benton - this man really had a very good taste ! ! ! But the script writers disappointed me extremely . The best ending would be the scene on the ladder , but instead of it , they decided that the father and his daughter should be together . Do n't like the ending . The father becomes boyfriend of his own daughter and his ex - wife knows about it and finds it alright . It would be OK , if the scriptwriters would for example say that now there is a different soul in the body , but they did not , they only deprived him of memories . The actors were good , they were really funny . Cybill Shepherd was charming , Robert Downey Jr. was very funny in the dancing scene : ) ) ) ... But some of the moments spoil even the impression of good acting . For example , Corinne Jeffries , played by Cybill Shepherd after the death of her husband was waiting for him 23 years ( it 's a long time ! ) , she was true to him , she loved nobody but him , and when she met him and was just about making love to him , after a scene with her friend Philip Train ( Ryan O'Neal ) , she very easily betrayed the man she was longing for so many years ! ! ! It would be a good movie , if not the ending and some missed human psychology .
pos	This movie is great entertainment to watch with the wife or girlfriend . There are laughs galore and some very interesting little nudist stories going on here . The actresses are all very interesting and definitely worth watching in their natural beauty . Maslin beach life is full of diverse nudists and personality types . The Australian coast scenery is , simply , splendid to see . What a place to visit , to say the least , and one day it may become my hideaway . I really enjoy this movie and every time I watch it I enjoy it more . I would love to see more of these characters and I always wonder what became of them . Although the plot is somewhat soft , this movie is , of course , a great excuse to just sit back on the couch and enjoy the wonderful and famous Maslin beach with these wonderful nudists and their own personal stories .
neg	Yep , the topic is a straight quote from the movie and I think it 's pretty accurate . I was so bored to dead with this pointless effort . All the flashes etc . making no sense after first 20 minutes is just bad film making + If you are epileptic , you would have died at least five times already . Of course all the David Lynch fans would raise a flag for this kind of turkey to be " the best film ever made " because it does n't make any sense AND when it does n't make any sense it 's got to be art , and art movie is always good . Right ? I say WRONG . This kind of artificial art grab is just a pathetic way to try to show that you 're a good film maker . Anthony Hopkins as a excellent actor should just stay acting .
pos	Carlos Mencia was excellent this is hour special . He was working hard to show everybody he was the real deal . I know people have said he 's stolen material in this special , but that is not true . Carlos brings comedy up front the way he wants it , not how anyone else wants it , that is why he is so good . People say he 's not funny because he says Dee dee dee too much , and they still have n't realized that s part of his act , and they do n't want it that way , but he brings it like that anyway , and succeeds in making people laugh . For all the haters out there , here is a message , Carlos is here to stay , you have no point in trying to bring him down .
neg	Even duller , if possible , than the original ( I hope I may say that under the IMDb guidelines ) . THE FRENCH CONNECTION at least tried to absorb European influences , to complicate the conventional view of the American police detective , even if the attempt was foundered by Friedkin 's ambivalence , Americaness and general indirection . The ( relative ) arthouse boom of the 1960s ( especially with the nouvelle vague ) allowed for a huge influence of European cinema in Hollywood . This lent a new vigour and complexity to a weary medium , and , in the best of them ( eg BONNIE AND CLYDE , early Scorcese ) , a new subversion of received practice . The original CONNECTION was part of this movement , with its difficultly distanced style , and anti - detective figure . TWO is old Hollywood 's right - wing reassertion of American values . This is figured in the film 's very tiresome America vs France dialectic . For instance , TWO is shot like a 70s French policier . It was the French , of course , who insisted on the greatness of American movies when they were ignored at home , and this , in a sense , is a reclamation , a warning against Gallic presumption . This can be seen in the pattern of the two movies . CONNECTION has French gangsters invading New York , with the French style smothering the American thriller - this leads to the dissolution of the detective figure , and irresolution of plot - the baddie got away .   TWO has the American returning to France , with American thriller values imposed on the native genre - the power of the detective is reasserted and conventional resolution is achieved . This is further dramatised in Doyle 's relationship with French inspector Barthelmy , whose dominant influence he must shake off before he can control the plot . TWO seems to follow the original by undermining its detective hero . From the start , Doyle 's importance is diminished at every turn . Despite the ending of CONNECTION , he is considered a hero . But he is an American in a foreign land , and his inability to control language or customs means he can not dominate the plot . He even misreads the signs of the police force , mistaking an informer for a criminal , and getting him killed .   A detective 's power comes from his power as subject to see and interpret , but Doyle spends much of the movie being watched , controlled , an object , a body ( literally in the scenes after he is dumped by Charnier ) to be viewed and interpreted . In CONNECTION , he instigated the action , chasing the criminals , forcing the plot ; here he is passive , tied to a bed , locked in a cell , an addict , a dependent . This loss of phallic power is predictably symbolised in the loss of his gun , and the film follows a depressingly familiar Oedipal trajectory . In the heroin sequences , he is comforted by an old lady who says he looks like her son . His drugged state is like a return to the womb , robbed of adult pressures . Her taking his watch reinforces the timelessness of this state , doubly significant for a man whose career depends on timetables and precision . Oedipus was the first detective , and to avoid his fate , Doyle must reject this false mother who is dissolving his unified identity , and kill the father ( Charnier ) so that he can take his accepted masculine role in society . Psychoanalytic theory was popular among academics in the 70s(ironically instigated by a Frenchman , Jacques Lacan ) , but it 's rare to see a film so literally full of it .   If all of these facts tended towards the minimising of Doyle , then the film 's style does n't . Friedkin distanced us from his hero by refusing empathy or character motivation , focusing on the mechanics of plot . Here , Doyle is a very conventional Hollywood hero . Instead of being lost in murky long shot , he is made knowable and understandable to the viewer with the traditional devices - point - of - view shots , close ups , connecting shots etc . TWO is all about the fall and rise of Popeye Doyle . Plot in this case is subservient to the acting , which is the usual Hackman showiness . The cold turkey scenes , therefore , despite their tediousness , are not disturbing . We are allowed to share rather than coldly observe ; this a far less discomforting experience . The scenes are also shot through with a lachrymose manly sentimentality that is very American .   So while CONNECTION tried to imitate the complex thrillers of Jean Pierre Melville , TWO does the complete opposite . Melville 's LE SAMOURAI featured a gangster who started the film whole , powerful , outside language , and charted his eventual disintegration . TWO starts with a disintegrated character , achieved partly through inability with language , whose dominance begins when he steps outside language - the concluding action sequences are largely wordless .   In the film , the locale and language are important as they fixed and undermined the detective , but as he regains his power ( figured in the return of his gun , and the cathartic burning of the primal site of vulnerability , the tower block where Charnier held him ) , the Marseilles setting becomes more irrelevant , and the mythic stand - off , which could take place anywhere , takes over . Compare the endings of the two films : one admits ambiguity and despair , the other absolute certainty .
pos	I thought How The Grinch Stole Christmas was a pretty good movie . It was n't horrible , nor was it great , but it was enjoyable to watch . I felt as if Jim Carrey got a little annoying at times . They made the Grinch seem like a special education person , when all he needed to be was evil and devious , but yet he turned out kind of retarded . I did think the scenery , when not inside the Grinch 's cave , was beautiful , and there was a few parts where I laughed , but most of the time I thought it was just annoying . This movie could 've been " SO " much better if they had changed the Grinch 's personality , and they had included some more laugh scenes , because most of the humor was n't funny . I liked How The Grinch Stole Christmas anyway , but it 's not anything to get excited about seeing .
neg	Bathebo , you big dope . This is the WORST piece of crap I 've seen in a long time . I have just stumbled onto it on late night TV and it is painful to watch . Really painful . How does something like this get made ? ? Horrible , horrible , horrible ! OOOOOO ..... The toilet is flushing by itself again ! Scary toilet ! Scary toilet ! Scary toilet ! 1992 does n't seem like that long ago to me , but watching this makes it seem like 1952 . I mean its horrible . Please do n't waste your time on the drivel ! Scary old black man telling them not to build the pool in the yard . Scary ! Scary ! How does this stuff get MADE ? ? ?
pos	This movie is funny and suitable for any age . It is definitely family - type entertainment . The cast does a fine job playing folks in the mid - western town of Big Bean , Illinois . Where we must assume nothing ever happens since the excitement ( pre - invasion ) of the decade is the new ( and only ) exit ramp from the Interstate . The location appeals as suitably boring and totally unlikely for the invasion of earth by Martians . But these Martians are totally inept , despite being well - equipped with an arsenal of suitably ghastly and deadly weapons ... including one set on eradicating the Martians , too ! The Martians dead - pan their lines and throw in just the right accents to make us the viewers and the locals wish to help them ... leave earth . J. J. Anderson playing the very young Halloween carnivorous duck has just great lines . Watch this movie for laugher and entertainment ; thought - provoking it is n't . But subtle and enjoyable it is .
neg	this film has its good points : hot chicks people die the problem ... the hot Chicks barley get nude and you do n't get to see many of the people dieing , mostly just lots of fast movements and screaming though there were two good kill scenes . also for those of you watching this for JENNA JAMESON she is just a side chearator with a very small role and Minor nude scenes . What this film needed .. script and story would be nice but I will not complain about that .. simply put it needs more nudity and better kill scenes cuz lets face it that is why we watch these flicks ... I would n't waste my money on it ... and if you must , wait until it 's on the OLD shelves at your local video store
pos	In my opinion , A GUY THING is a hilarious , witty , sexy , romantic , and totally beautiful chick flick that guys will also enjoy . I thought that Jason Lee and Julia Stiles dazzled as a bewildered groom - to - be and his soon - to - be sexy cousin - in - law . If you ask me , they lit up the screen like magic . You can also feel their chemistry between them . Before I wrap this up , I 'd like to say that the performances were top grade , the direction was flawless , the production design was nice , the casting was perfect , and the costumes were perfectly designed . In conclusion , to anyone who 's a fan of Jason Lee or Julia Stiles , I recommend this movie . You 're in for lots of laughs and thrills , so , go to the video store , rent it or buy it , kick back with a friend , and watch it .
neg	I like Billy Crystal , and I thought it would be fun to watch this film , since I know he admired Alan King and they would be funny together . I thought I had seen all Billy 's movies but could n't remember this one , and now I know why . It 's so full of clichés and phony emotion ; you can smell each scene coming ( and going ! ) . Billy does n't even get to be funny very often . He 's too busy trying to cry fake tears or show his angst at how badly his father let him down . Alan King himself is fairly likable , as is the subplot about being an extra in the movies . But what a coincidence that Billy just happens to visit his father just as a major health crisis takes place , etc . etc . Or that two busy doctors can just shut down their practices to moon around in LA . And when the end comes , boy , does it come quickly ! Almost as though the writers realized they had painted themselves into a corner and the only way out was to do a death scene . Mostly disappointing with a few glimmers of good humor .
pos	The most interesting thing about Miryang ( Secret Sunshine ) is the actors . Jeon Do - yeon , as Lee Shin - ae , the main character , is a woman with a young son whose husband has died in a tragic accident , and who leaves Seoul to live in Miryang , which was his home town , with her young son . Jeon 's face is very changeable . She is girlish , flirtatious , elegant , aged and sad , desperate and joyous , with it and terribly isolated by turns , and it 's all in her face . The film also stars Song Kang - ho as Kim , a man who meets her when her car breaks down coming into Miryang ,
